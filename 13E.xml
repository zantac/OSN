I have heard that the movie will show them without any censorship. However, I was not prepared for the real horror of those events. The movie is graphic, but it does not go overboard.

All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.\n\nWhat follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!\n\nA special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!\n\nHighly enjoyable and highly recommended!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-05","keywords":"psychopath,ex soldier,killing spree,bullying,grief","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2685905945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action.

Von Trotta odnosi się także do miejsc ważnych dla biografii reżysera. W filmie głos zabierają również współpracownicy szwedzkiego mistrza oraz młodsze pokolenie filmowców, dla których dokonania Bergmana są stałym źródłem inspiracji.</desc>

She discovers that the cheers and routines for the last several years have been stolen from another school's squad. Torrance relies on a reluctant gymnast named Missy(Eliza Dushku)to convince the cheer team to learn new material to take to the next state competition. What a shame it is that the football team is so awful that the schools pride is in the cheerleaders. This is an interesting eyeful, but actually just another vehicle for the enticing Miss Dunst.\n\nFine support from:Pua Kapiolani, Tsianina Joelson, Clare Kramer and Nicole Bilderback. If you have a cheerleader fetish, you will think this romp deserves an Oscar. Nonetheless enjoyable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91619,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance","Sport"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"legs,cheerleading squad,bikini,teenage romance,female nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244630/","name":"Eliza Dushku","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103038/","name":"Jesse Bradford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0715636/","name":"Peyton Reed"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335449/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070566/","name":"Jessica Bendinger"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Telling the story of the 1976 AirFrance hijacking by Palestinian and German revolutionaries, and subsequent Israeli Defence Force rescue mission (Operation Thunderbolt), the film is presented from multiple points of view; Revolutionäre Zellen members Brigitte Kuhlmann (Rosamund Pike) and Wilfried Böse (Daniel Brühl), Israeli Minister for Defence Shimon Peres (Eddie Marsan), Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (Lior Ashkenazi), IDF Pvt.

Indeed, the only Palestinian given any kind of development is a fictional character played by Omar Berdouni, who talks of Israeli tanks driving over a car in which his family were trapped. And there are other strange omissions; the death of Dora Bloch (Trudy Weiss), murdered on Amin's orders after she was released in Kampala, is never mentioned, and Wadie Haddad is nowhere to be found. Additionally, the film doesn't have much of contemporaneous relevance to say in relation to the Arab-Israeli Conflict, other than alluding melancholically to the self-propagating nature of the violence, and the unlikelihood of peace (the closing legend points out that after he pushed for negotiations in 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist). However, it's aesthetically very well put together, and the juxtaposition of Thunderbolt with a Jewish dance number works much better than it has any right to. True, it doesn't get to the heart of the matter by any stretch of the imagination, and it could be accused of taking a pro-Israeli stance, but it's enjoyable enough, and worth a look.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14941,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2018-03-16","keywords":"airport,airplane,hostage,operation thunderbolt,entebbe uganda","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4222597145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzNTU2MjktMDE3NC00ZTNjLWExM2ItNDgzYzI2NDI3OWJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzNTU2MjktMDE3NC00ZTNjLWExM2ItNDgzYzI2NDI3OWJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A thriller inspired by the true events of the 1976 hijacking of an Air France flight en route from Tel Aviv to Paris, the film depicts the most daring rescue mission ever attempted"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9962502/","name":"Batsheva Dance Company"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8277521/","name":"Zina Zinchenko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3115493/","name":"Ben Schnetzer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0655683/","name":"José Padilha"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0091846/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2954373/","name":"Gregory Burke"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you like gang-rebellion, drugs, robbery, street art and thrills, this is definitely your kind of movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-05-01","keywords":"gangland murder,interracial,heist,gang rape,drug war","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Anti-Social (2015) Special Edition Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3838096921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMTcwMDg3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMzMTk3MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMTcwMDg3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMzMTk3MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Special Edition International Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2116419/","name":"Gregg Sulkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1620783/","name":"Meghan Markle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322260/","name":"Josh Myers"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1857340/","name":"Reg Traviss"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0534736/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465389/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374148/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1857340/","name":"Reg Traviss"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What exactly does that mean?  I am an intelligent moviegoer and I loved Sneakers.  And I know others who are much more intelligent than me and some who I would even guess are certifiable geniuses who also loved this movie.\n\nThis movie is captivating.  As other people have written, Sneakers can be watched over and over again.  Its a suspense thriller that doesn't try to blind you with so many special effects that you lose sight of the fact that less than five minutes was used to create and edit the script (ie. Mission Impossible 2).\n\nThis is a fun movie for anybody who is a team player.  Its very entertaining to see how each member of Redford's team brings an essential element to the task at hand.  There are a couple of scenes where some things are far fetched, but nothing outside the rhelm of possibility.  There is nothing that makes you groan in disgust, as if say you were watching any scene in a John Woo film.

What exactly does that mean?  I am an intelligent moviegoer and I loved Sneakers.  And I know others who are much more intelligent than me and some who I would even guess are certifiable geniuses who also loved this movie.\n\nThis movie is captivating.  As other people have written, Sneakers can be watched over and over again.  Its a suspense thriller that doesn't try to blind you with so many special effects that you lose sight of the fact that less than five minutes was used to create and edit the script (ie. Mission Impossible 2).\n\nThis is a fun movie for anybody who is a team player.  Its very entertaining to see how each member of Redford's team brings an essential element to the task at hand.  There are a couple of scenes where some things are far fetched, but nothing outside the rhelm of possibility.  There is nothing that makes you groan in disgust, as if say you were watching any scene in a John Woo film.  For a movie like this to work it has to be believable, and this is believable.\n\nSneakers is original in its ideas and the characters are very likable.

With these people making this film, there is no surprise that they succeeded to execute those ambitions. Though, the storytelling is a bit messy with endless action set pieces. Despite of those flaws, it's still whimsically magical and heartwarming.\n\nThe story centers a childhood guardian, Jack Frost. Among the guardians, he's the least known and believed by the children. It's pretty interesting since most of us only know very little about him, we intend to intrigue about his story. When it goes to the famous legends, it gets bigger and quicker with plenty of humor. The film is also an action movie. The action scenes are amazingly done and eye candy, but they somehow get excessive causing a bit mess to the storyline. It's charming when they go to their relationship with the children, and it's appealing when it explores to their worlds.\n\nThe characters are wonderful enough. The voice performances are great. Chris Pine's performance is charming enough to keep Jack Frost pretty endearing. Alec Baldwin brings plenty of joy to his character. Hugh Jackman uses his Australian accent to the Easter Bunny which really fits to the character. The rest are expectedly delightful.\n\nThe visuals are undeniably astonishing. Every scene of the film is spectacular and beautiful to look at, making the experience very magical. The 3D enhances the experience more or less. The character designs are inspired. I bet many would love the Sandman's that looks so lovable. And the music score adds sweetness to the sequences.\n\nRise of the Guardians is a little bit disappointing but also a bit satisfying. It has the heart in a right amount but only the half of the film. The rest is all action and having fun, but it's not a bad thing. They just could have moderated the craziness and get a bit of focus to the storyline. The film is still worth watching. It can be a classic if it has a better storytelling but if you don't care then that won't be a problem. Overall, it's filled with excitement and beautiful animation.

From start to finish, bad, stinky bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. If you force yourself to watch this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. The movie is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I've seen better animation in the original cut of the Blob. You will get more entertainment from watching Gone with the Wind while suffering from the puke and poops. Bad acting and hokey lines will have you squirming and wishing you had rented Peewee's big Top or watched every episode of Gilligan's Island back to back.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.\n\nI hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.\n\nI hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matinée price.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191694,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"monster,nuclear explosion,explosion,strong female character,strong female lead","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810380569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Resident Evil: Apocalypse","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347149/","name":"Sienna Guillory","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531095/","name":"Eric Mabius"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936838/","name":"Alexander Witt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun!

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun!

The character traits are still visible and some of the issues have gone further (J. Ferrara and Unions characters).\n\nThere is fun to be had, although the script is not as good and witty as the first one.

The end result is not as good as the first one, but you can still have fun. There is a bit of an evolution (though the "mom" still seems to have the same issues, but gets a different kind of story-line/character that will serve her right ...), but nothing too major. The character traits are still visible and some of the issues have gone further (J. Ferrara and Unions characters).\n\nThere is fun to be had, although the script is not as good and witty as the first one. Still if you loved the characters in the first one, you should be able to go on that second ride with them.

The worst part is that he continues to make movies, terrible movies, and gets away with it, collecting generous paychecks. Only thing that changes is his character's name. The only reason I got this movie 4* is that I was impressed with Jade Yorker's performance and that there were couple of OK fighting scenes, I guess. But man, that kid CAN act, he really show passion and emotions. Why is it so hard for Steven to try and show us some emotions, like he did? Sadness, happiness, compassion etc. He continues to maintain the same facial expression throughout his whole filmography, and that (now that he got old and really obese) irritates me, because I know he can do better, I guess he just doesn't care.

I knew who the main "bad guy" was since I first saw him in the movie, and I don't want to know that right away, I want something surprising. Gangs, shooting, money, corrupt cop(s), one woman, car chasing, fight scenes (obviously speeded up and unreal sometimes, especially the "fist in a gunfight" scene)... and that's about it. We saw that a million times ago in cinematography. It tends to get pretty boring. Also, I really didn't like Eddie Griffin's role as Armand Tucker, I thought it was pretty overacted.\n\nFor me, if you really want to see a relatively good Seagal movie made in 21st century, watch Pistol Whipped and Exit Wounds, the only good movies in which he starred since the 1996 and Executive Decision (in which he died, ironically), they were much better altogether, and skip this crap, please.

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).\n\nEveryone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.\n\nLike Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.\n\nWhen it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better "Snatch".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":810515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-09-01","keywords":"diamond,boxer,narrated by character,fight,cockney accent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Snatch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1558577433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334318/","name":"Stephen Graham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).\n\nEveryone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.\n\nLike Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.\n\nWhen it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better "Snatch".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":810515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-09-01","keywords":"diamond,boxer,narrated by character,fight,cockney accent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Snatch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1558577433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334318/","name":"Stephen Graham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It will keep you on the edge of your seat for a long time.\n\nAnd i really can't understand where all those bad reviews are coming from... go check The Shield out for yourself!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-12","keywords":"corrupt cop,los angeles california,made for cable tv,mayor,drugs","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004821/","name":"Michael Chiklis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413052/","name":"Michael Jace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439813/","name":"Jay Karnes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086397/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0203234/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752841/","name":"Shawn Ryan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Shield: Season Seven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi425591577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home video trailer for the final season of this cop show"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable.

Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people.

Though this isn't about bushfires specifically, this is a post climate change driven saga that is pretty realistic - in a pretty scary way. Excellent character driven narrative around families, relationships, parenting, financial and racial divides, corruption, climate change, climate refugees, PTSD and traumas from just being alive as its all going down. One might think the writers had a crystal ball - it's pretty spot on and so well timed given that our entire continent is burning and that climate change is no longer some abstract futuristic theory, but something we are now living through, even in our cities. An enjoyable watch, some might find boring, possibly all the people that have reviewed this show thinking it's Lisa Macwhatsherface in the lead role (spoiler: it's not, and yes that British accent is real) - but this show really delivers in the last few episodes in season one. It's in your face about many subjects we like to shun - if you are after a non thought provoking, non challenging easy view, go watch something else, this is not for you. Touching a lot on the effects the changing climate has on young people and their narratives and responses around that, I found this helpful as a parent. Great all round production, futuristic but realistic visual, A1 cast portraying depth-full honest and challenging characters. If you liked Aussie drama Love my way, you will like this. A lot.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"wanting to have a baby,climate change,female protagonist,melodrama,near future","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296219/","name":"Joanne Froggatt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672303/","name":"Rupert Penry-Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2256017/","name":"David Lyons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0292799/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [EN]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3580346649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIwMTM1NzgtM2Q0Ni00NmJhLTljZmQtOGE0ZmM3OThlYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIwMTM1NzgtM2Q0Ni00NmJhLTljZmQtOGE0ZmM3OThlYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Trying to discover what happened, she gets back in touch with her old high school friends, who've all lived 17 years of life, while she is still just a girl in the body of a woman.\n\nThe plot is obviously similar to the movie Big and all the critics have already bothered to point that out. While 13 Going on 30 isn't as good or engaging as Big, it's still a decent film with a nice message. The movie works a lot better than it should because of Jennifer Garner. She's funny and she has a great personality. It also helps that she's having fun in the role and it's so hard to actually hate her because she plays a very likable character. Mark Ruffalo gives an okay performance, he was a little dull though. I don't think comedy is his best genre. There are also some fun performances from Andy Serkis and Judy Greer.\n\nThe film was too cheesy and silly for me at times. For example, there was this one scene where Jennifer Garner is at a sleepover with all these little thirteen year old girls and she's telling them about her kissing experiences. After she does this, they all get up and start dancing. It was just so cheesy and annoying though girls will probably love that part. The movie is also pretty predictable. If you have seen the preview then you should know how things will end. The movie is pretty simple yet still entertaining. It's also a lot better than other similar films like Chasing Liberty and The Prince and Me. In the end, 13 Going on 30 is a decent, charming chick flick that should appeal to it's target audience.

It's also a lot better than other similar films like Chasing Liberty and The Prince and Me. In the end, 13 Going on 30 is a decent, charming chick flick that should appeal to it's target audience.

It mixes hard science with abject fantasy to make moral and philosophical points about the human condition and our place in the universe without the usual clichés. And it does so with good dialog, strong characterization, and intensely emotional acting. Harris and Mastrantonio are absolutely electric together and dominate the screen, but the entire cast deserves plenty of credit. The production itself is mesmerizing despite its vast scale and tastefully used special effects. The film is long, but worth every second of the experience, and the slightly lengthier, more detailed Special Edition version is even better than the original.\n\nOstensibly, this is a film about first contact with non-terrestrial intelligence. But the story allegorically deals with an amazing array of themes common to great dramas - violence, love, capitalism, war, courage and cowardice. The hardest, most obedient soldier in the film, played spectacularly by Michael Biehn, is a coward, and a man who is hopelessly in love with his estranged wife (Harris) turns that love into an act of suicidal heroism which might unintentionally save the world. And yet nothing is exactly as it seems to be, and there are really no spoilers in this review. There are so many subtle and sensitively developed themes in this film that it is hard to imagine a more epically human drama in the sci-fi genre. Even so, this is a film which entertains at every level, and will satisfy the action fan as much as the wannabe film critic. ;-) \n\nMost of the film takes place on an experimental submarine drilling platform owned by a petroleum company. A nuclear sub has been lost in "the abyss" - a subduction trench near the Caiman Islands - after encountering an impossibly fast object. Soon, the US military commandeers the platform and its command ship - The Benthic Explorer - to attempt a rescue mission. As everything begins to go wrong, and the encounters with strange phenomena continue, the Navy SEAL in charge of the rescue attempt begins to crack. Meanwhile, on the surface, accusations concerning the sub are escalating between the USSR and USA, and nuclear war seems immanent.

Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.\n\nNot that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen.

The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.\n\nAs is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as "fantastic"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158698,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.\n\nNot that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece.

Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

I loved the whole premise of the first one, and having a sequel opened up whole new opportunities. I was excited when I saw all these famous characters from history being mashed together, Al Capone, Napoleon Bonaparte, Amelia Earhart, to name a few. \n\nI walked into the theater not expecting to much, but when I left I was very happy with it. They handled every characters personality beautifully, and the inside jokes were hilarious. I don't want to give much away, but trust me, you'll laugh. It tackles many themes like, a house divided cannot stand, the way to happiness is doing what you love, don't dwell on the past, etc. For a family flick they handle this jumbled cast of characters with complex personalities amazingly.

I loved the whole premise of the first one, and having a sequel opened up whole new opportunities. I was excited when I saw all these famous characters from history being mashed together, Al Capone, Napoleon Bonaparte, Amelia Earhart, to name a few. \n\nI walked into the theater not expecting to much, but when I left I was very happy with it. They handled every characters personality beautifully, and the inside jokes were hilarious. I don't want to give much away, but trust me, you'll laugh. It tackles many themes like, a house divided cannot stand, the way to happiness is doing what you love, don't dwell on the past, etc. For a family flick they handle this jumbled cast of characters with complex personalities amazingly. They threw away most of the characters from the first movie to make way for the newer characters, which I didn't like that much, but how many characters can you throw in a story to have it make sense?\n\nThis film is an amazing example of a movie made for kids and adults.

Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.\n\nNot that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.\n\nAs is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as "fantastic"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158698,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic. In fact, as the opening titles state, the film is dedicated to "my sister, who made me sit on top of the wardrobe".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In fact, as the opening titles state, the film is dedicated to "my sister, who made me sit on top of the wardrobe".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First off, I have never seen an Alexander Payne film, and the story itself sort of seemed like the type of film that would end up on a long list of solid films that end up being unmemorable. Much to my surprise, it has a sort of tone that you don't see often in these types of films.\n\nThis is a film that carefully treads around the edges. I wouldn't say it ever became too sentimental. Yet I also expected a snappy dialogue- filled, fast-paced dramedy, sort of like Reitman's Up in the Air, that other Clooney film. The film is written and plays out like a real life situation. One could maybe try to say that about any film like this, but here it rings true. To say it's slow or fast paced isn't really what matters, but what matters is how much it develops its characters with real richness and detail. In a way, the screenplay is helped a lot by Payne as a director, not because the writing is thin, but because the direction allows the film to feel sort of spontaneous. This isn't a film full of twists or turns, and yet at every corner when you try to analyze it, you realize how unpredictable it all feels. \n\nI have also heard one thing about it in many reviews, and that is how it's messy like life. One can easily read those descriptions and just roll his or her eyes, but that description really holds truth. The film doesn't feel to glamorous or stylized. It certainly isn't the dramedy with witty one liners that I expected. Instead, when it's all over, you take a step back and realize that it all feels sort of messy. It's not complicated, and in fact it's a pretty simple film, but even the editing helps this certain mood that the film leaves you in. It's simple, yet hard to really pinpoint and describe how it all comes together or how it's something of real importance. This is completely refreshing, especially when films these days hammer you with these sort of messages or details.\n\nI now want to talk about the performances, which are stellar. Clooney just won the Globe a couple of hours ago, and now I look at it and think to myself "wow... of all of his performances, this is getting him awards?". It's a very restrained performance, and no, it isn't a transformation. Some will once again say that Clooney is only "playing himself", but to me, when Clooney does great, he really nails it. He gives all of his performances something distinct about them, and this is perhaps his wild-card character. He doesn't add in his usual smoothness that we see a lot from him. This stands apart, and I am surprised for that reason for its success. Shailene Woodley is fantastic here as well, and really impressed me with the sort of indignation and maturity that she mixes together. She's better than most of the contenders for the Oscar in her category, more specifically Octavia Spencer, Melissa McCarthy, and Janet McTeer.\n\nI loved this film. I wasn't sure of it while I was seeing it, but after it's over, as hard as it is to really describe and know why I enjoyed it so much, I did.

(or should go to)... "Dame Emma Thompson".","reviewBody":"Judge Maye (Thompson) is a childless wife to her loving husband Jack (Tucci), but is also a workaholic. This is driving the long-term couple to the point of infidelity: a fact the ever-focused Fiona - whose life, to her, probably feels to be in a perfect if selfish equilibrium - is oblivious to. With Fiona's intense but comfortable world about to cave in around her, her increasing stress is not helped by the latest case she is working on: one where Adam ( Fionn Whitehead from "Dunkirk"), a Jehovah's Witness boy and a minor, is refusing on religious grounds the blood transfusion he desperately needs to fight his lukaemia. Fiona's decisions in the months ahead go much further than a simple judgement on the case.\n\nTwo acting giants - one born in London; one born in New York - tower over this Ian McEwan adaptation like leviathons. I bandy around the phrase "national treasure" a lot in my reviews, but here Emma Thompson is simply breathtakingly powerful in the lead role of Judge Fiona Maye, exhibiting such extremes of emotion that you would like to think that an Oscar nomination would be assured. (However, before I run out and put a £10 bet on her to win, the film is such a small British film that unfortunately both a nomination and a win seem unlikely! THIS IS A CRIME! Please share and lobby people, lobby! Perhaps at the very least we can hope for some BAFTA recognition). \n\nSometimes a masterly lead performance can make a co-star performance seem unbalanced, but no such danger here. Stanley Tucci makes a perfect acting foil for Thompson: if he were a wine he would be described as "exasperation, frustration, compassion with strong notes of respect". And he carries it off with perfection.\n\nThis is an incredibly intelligent film, working on so many different levels and subject to so much interpretation. Fiona's feelings for the troubled teenager feel more maternal than sexual, but when those feelings become returned and escalate the whole piece develops a queasily oedipal quality. Many films have focused on illicit attractions between teacher and pupil, but here lies a new variation, with Maye fighting against her best professional insticts to 'do the right thing'. "I'm frightened of myself" she eventually wails to a colleague. \n\nIn his opening hospital scenes, (not withstanding the comic similarities between the guitar scene here and a certain scene in "Airplane"!), Adam seems completely other-wordly compared to a typical teen and this comes across as utterly false. That is, until you consider the oddness of his family background and Jehovah's Witness upbringing. As such, the film just about gets away with it. Whitehead does a good job with a difficult role. \n\nIf you've been in a court, you'll know that there is something regal and magical about a judge in full regalia entering a packed courtroom. So it's unusual to see the view from the other side of the door... a non-descript office corridor and a non-descript door. Helping the judge on this side of the door is her PA Nigel, played by the brilliant Jason Watkins: a TV regular (e.g. "Line of Duty", "W1A") but seen far less at the movies. \n\nAs a story of obsessive fixation, it borders on McEwan's disturbing earlier work "Enduring Love". And it has the potential to go in lots of interesting directions as a sort of bonkers platonic love triangle ("He wants to live with US?" splutters Tucci). Where the story does end up going was not particularly to my liking, and a melodramatic concert scene was - for me - a little overdone. However it does give rise to a scene (the 'sopping wet' scene) that shows Thompson at her most brilliant: if she DID get Oscar or BAFTA nominated then this will be her pre-announcement snippet.\n\nIt's a great film for showcasing acting talent, but beware: it's short on laughs, not remotely uplifting and takes a while to mentally recover from!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-08-24","keywords":"female judge,husband wife relationship,teenage boy,teenager,17 year old","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677390105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As her marriage to Jack (Stanley Tucci) flounders, eminent High Court judge Fiona Maye (Emma Thompson) has a life-changing decision to make at work - should she force a teenage boy, Adam (Fionn Whitehead), to have the blood transfusion that will save his life?

Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...\n\nA fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. Jason Statham is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit, not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight. Co-stars Shu Qi (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).\n\nHighly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":292569,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-12-11","keywords":"gunfight,premarital sex,mixed martial arts,tape over mouth,motor car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Transporter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3455779097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RjMjA2ZGQtMDJlMy00Mzk4LWJjNDYtNGJjMzczNzc3MGQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RjMjA2ZGQtMDJlMy00Mzk4LWJjNDYtNGJjMzczNzc3MGQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795517/","name":"Shu Qi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776580/","name":"Matt Schulze"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477035/","name":"Corey Yuen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051228/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000108/","name":"Luc Besson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...\n\nA fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. Jason Statham is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit, not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight. Co-stars Shu Qi (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).\n\nHighly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":292569,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-12-11","keywords":"gunfight,premarital sex,mixed martial arts,tape over mouth,motor car","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Transporter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3455779097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RjMjA2ZGQtMDJlMy00Mzk4LWJjNDYtNGJjMzczNzc3MGQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RjMjA2ZGQtMDJlMy00Mzk4LWJjNDYtNGJjMzczNzc3MGQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795517/","name":"Shu Qi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776580/","name":"Matt Schulze"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477035/","name":"Corey Yuen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051228/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000108/","name":"Luc Besson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Amongst the horrors of the Nazi occupation, and the ferocious Jews persecution in the Ukraine the protagonist manages to escape pretending to be a gentile. The peasant she shelters with are not good or altruistic, they are just downtrodden people, fiercely attached to their land and traditions. While the cinematography and the direction is passable but not memorable and the story line somehow mundane, probably the better aspect of the production reside in the depiction of the local peasant society, of their perennial straggle against whatever power exploit them and their self-reliance. People that cannot afford to be generous or open-minded. There are only few acts of genuine altruism and many more of the opposite but the unsentimental and non-judgmental approach to the storytelling is refreshing, leaving the viewer to make up its mind on the grey morality of the real world.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":422,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-02-27","keywords":"world war two,jewish refugee,polish jew,13 year old girl,child protagonist","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9160474/","name":"Zuzanna Surowy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9160475/","name":"Konrad Cichon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472028/","name":"Pawel Królikowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649881/","name":"Steven Oritt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0639858/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0571591/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0385430/","name":"David Himmelstein"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Amongst the horrors of the Nazi occupation, and the ferocious Jews persecution in the Ukraine the protagonist manages to escape pretending to be a gentile. The peasant she shelters with are not good or altruistic, they are just downtrodden people, fiercely attached to their land and traditions. While the cinematography and the direction is passable but not memorable and the story line somehow mundane, probably the better aspect of the production reside in the depiction of the local peasant society, of their perennial straggle against whatever power exploit them and their self-reliance. People that cannot afford to be generous or open-minded. There are only few acts of genuine altruism and many more of the opposite but the unsentimental and non-judgmental approach to the storytelling is refreshing, leaving the viewer to make up its mind on the grey morality of the real world.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":422,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-02-27","keywords":"world war two,jewish refugee,polish jew,13 year old girl,child protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9160474/","name":"Zuzanna Surowy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9160475/","name":"Konrad Cichon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472028/","name":"Pawel Królikowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649881/","name":"Steven Oritt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0639858/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0571591/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0385430/","name":"David Himmelstein"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The ending is so abrupt and unexpected that it leaves the audience wondering whether the film reel missed a splicing. \n\nI would like to watch a Polish movie worthy of the time to see it and this one falls so far behind that and I truly regret the wasted time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":359,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-11-17","keywords":"fall from height,accident,kissing,male female relationship,marriage proposal","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2252397/","name":"Antoni Pawlicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891502/","name":"Nataliya Vdovina","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102765/","name":"Jacek Braciak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264614/","name":"Slawomir Fabicki"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147152/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264614/","name":"Slawomir Fabicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367885/","name":"Denijal Hasanovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2256587/","name":"Marek Pruchniewski"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.\n\nNot that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling.

Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.\n\nNot that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.\n\nAs is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as "fantastic"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158698,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

I don't get why It did got 6.2 on IMDb I give it 10 out of 10. I love the action I love Danny Glover he is my favorite action star! From Lethal Weapon 1 &amp; 2 he is terrific he is the action hero I wanted. Gary Busey and Danny Glover they both started in Lethal Weapon. In this movie they were great. I am a big fan of action flick Predator 2 and is not a stupid movie! I am comparing with Lethal Weapon 1. Because Danny Glover star of Lethal Weapon was the main cast and hero. Gary Busey from Lethal weapon was FBI agent and Glover's nemesis like was Gibson's nemesis in Lethal Weapon. The movie has great action tough the plot wasn't great but was 90's action and I love it. \n\nIt is my childhood movie and the last good Predator film and worthy sequel of all time. I don't like Predators (2010) and I think Predators it is a rip off the first film. When people criticizing movies I love them because I am a big fan of Predator 1 &amp; 2 so I really don't care. Arnold Schwarzenegger turn down the offer to reprise his role from the first movie he said the story set in the city would be bad idea and maybe it was. The new Predator the actor form the first movie had new technological weapons than in the first one. I love Predator 2 no matter what everyone say's I love my childhood movies and I enjoyed the score too and the movie it is not bad as people are saying, it is underrated I love it.\n\nThere are many elements that I enjoyed in the film. The score, the action scenes and Danny Glover. The predator was there as a test of rites or passage which is pretty clear by the end with the elders showing up to collect his body. I think this film is highly underrated and no where near as bad as some say about it.\n\nWhy I love this film as much, that I love the original film?: because of action, it is sequel to the first movie, Kevin Peter Hall stars in this movie actor from the first movie , it has Predator movie theme score, more Predators showed up at the end. Glover gets a gun from 1717 sorry if I did not wrote correctly. I always love Predator 1 &amp; 2 movies no matter what, if it was terrible or not.Some people are saying similar things about Predators but I am not listening them, I love them and I am listening to my self. Predator 2 does have error hole the story shouldn't be set 10.years after first movie in 1997 Los Angeles because the movie was released in 1990" so it should be set in that year. \n\nKevin Peter Hall returns as Predator. When Gary Busey say's The Lions, The Tigers, The Bears, o may your the Lion and this is the Jungle. Predator 2 the story is set in Urban jungle and is different than the first one. You are 100% right predator 2 doesn't copy predator 1 it has his own story. Predators did copy the first movie. Oh and AVPR Requiem they stole the line from Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator! I think both movies are great. I love both of them. I only liked Predators because the story was set in an amazon Jungle and it relaxed me. Predators does have a lot of mistakes and I hate it. Lauernce Fishburne from The Matrix and CSI with who was he talking? when he set the fire for Brody and his friends ugh. The rest of the Predators film I don't like. \n\nPredator 2 is the best one! It is better than Predators! I love Predator 2. Danny Glover and Gary Busey are the main cast and they completely rock. Predator 2 is the best action movie ever. More sci-fi and action more facts about Predator, they are more Predators.They are cops and FBI agents best action movie in 90s i love you Danny Glover killed him at the end of the movie Arnold did not killed him he only wounded him, Predator activated self distraction advise and he blows him self up,so Arnold did not killed him. A lot of people does not get this movie. So if you hate this movie than don't watch Predator 2,go and watch Smurfs instead stupid morons!Predator I and II are excellent films. Part III was outrageous and out of question. It has since become a cult film among fans.\n\nAmidst a territorial gang war, a sophisticated alien hunter stalks the citizens of Los Angeles and the only man between him and his prey is veteran L.A.P.D. officer, Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.\n\nThis electrifying action sequel unleashes the deadly invisible Predator in another jungle -- the urban jungle of Los Angeles. Danny Glover stars as a lieutenant who mistakenly concludes that mangled bodies found by the police are the work of feuding gangs. Instead, he finds himself confronting a savage alien who has come from a distant world to hunt humans for sport. Gary Busey and Ruben Blades co-star in this action-packed, high-tech thriller.\n\nPredator 2 is a 1990 American science fiction action film written by Jim and John Thomas, directed by Stephen Hopkins, and starring Danny Glover and Kevin Peter Hall. The film is a sequel to 1987's Predator, and Kevin Peter Hall again plays the role of the Predator.\n\n10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox, Silver Pictures Starring: Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Ruben Blades María Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, Robert Davi Director: Stephen Hopkins Producer: Joel Silver, Lawrence Gordon, John Davis Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 48 Mins.

I don't get why It did got 6.2 on IMDb I give it 10 out of 10. I love the action I love Danny Glover he is my favorite action star! From Lethal Weapon 1 &amp; 2 he is terrific he is the action hero I wanted. Gary Busey and Danny Glover they both started in Lethal Weapon. In this movie they were great. I am a big fan of action flick Predator 2 and is not a stupid movie! I am comparing with Lethal Weapon 1. Because Danny Glover star of Lethal Weapon was the main cast and hero. Gary Busey from Lethal weapon was FBI agent and Glover's nemesis like was Gibson's nemesis in Lethal Weapon. The movie has great action tough the plot wasn't great but was 90's action and I love it. \n\nIt is my childhood movie and the last good Predator film and worthy sequel of all time. I don't like Predators (2010) and I think Predators it is a rip off the first film. When people criticizing movies I love them because I am a big fan of Predator 1 &amp; 2 so I really don't care. Arnold Schwarzenegger turn down the offer to reprise his role from the first movie he said the story set in the city would be bad idea and maybe it was. The new Predator the actor form the first movie had new technological weapons than in the first one. I love Predator 2 no matter what everyone say's I love my childhood movies and I enjoyed the score too and the movie it is not bad as people are saying, it is underrated I love it.\n\nThere are many elements that I enjoyed in the film. The score, the action scenes and Danny Glover. The predator was there as a test of rites or passage which is pretty clear by the end with the elders showing up to collect his body. I think this film is highly underrated and no where near as bad as some say about it.\n\nWhy I love this film as much, that I love the original film?: because of action, it is sequel to the first movie, Kevin Peter Hall stars in this movie actor from the first movie , it has Predator movie theme score, more Predators showed up at the end. Glover gets a gun from 1717 sorry if I did not wrote correctly. I always love Predator 1 &amp; 2 movies no matter what, if it was terrible or not.Some people are saying similar things about Predators but I am not listening them, I love them and I am listening to my self. Predator 2 does have error hole the story shouldn't be set 10.years after first movie in 1997 Los Angeles because the movie was released in 1990" so it should be set in that year. \n\nKevin Peter Hall returns as Predator. When Gary Busey say's The Lions, The Tigers, The Bears, o may your the Lion and this is the Jungle. Predator 2 the story is set in Urban jungle and is different than the first one. You are 100% right predator 2 doesn't copy predator 1 it has his own story. Predators did copy the first movie. Oh and AVPR Requiem they stole the line from Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator! I think both movies are great. I love both of them. I only liked Predators because the story was set in an amazon Jungle and it relaxed me. Predators does have a lot of mistakes and I hate it. Lauernce Fishburne from The Matrix and CSI with who was he talking? when he set the fire for Brody and his friends ugh. The rest of the Predators film I don't like. \n\nPredator 2 is the best one! It is better than Predators! I love Predator 2. Danny Glover and Gary Busey are the main cast and they completely rock. Predator 2 is the best action movie ever. More sci-fi and action more facts about Predator, they are more Predators.They are cops and FBI agents best action movie in 90s i love you Danny Glover killed him at the end of the movie Arnold did not killed him he only wounded him, Predator activated self distraction advise and he blows him self up,so Arnold did not killed him. A lot of people does not get this movie. So if you hate this movie than don't watch Predator 2,go and watch Smurfs instead stupid morons!Predator I and II are excellent films. Part III was outrageous and out of question. It has since become a cult film among fans.\n\nAmidst a territorial gang war, a sophisticated alien hunter stalks the citizens of Los Angeles and the only man between him and his prey is veteran L.A.P.D. officer, Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.\n\nThis electrifying action sequel unleashes the deadly invisible Predator in another jungle -- the urban jungle of Los Angeles. Danny Glover stars as a lieutenant who mistakenly concludes that mangled bodies found by the police are the work of feuding gangs. Instead, he finds himself confronting a savage alien who has come from a distant world to hunt humans for sport. Gary Busey and Ruben Blades co-star in this action-packed, high-tech thriller.\n\nPredator 2 is a 1990 American science fiction action film written by Jim and John Thomas, directed by Stephen Hopkins, and starring Danny Glover and Kevin Peter Hall. The film is a sequel to 1987's Predator, and Kevin Peter Hall again plays the role of the Predator.\n\n10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox, Silver Pictures Starring: Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Ruben Blades María Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, Robert Davi Director: Stephen Hopkins Producer: Joel Silver, Lawrence Gordon, John Davis Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 48 Mins.

It mixes hard science with abject fantasy to make moral and philosophical points about the human condition and our place in the universe without the usual clichés. And it does so with good dialog, strong characterization, and intensely emotional acting. Harris and Mastrantonio are absolutely electric together and dominate the screen, but the entire cast deserves plenty of credit. The production itself is mesmerizing despite its vast scale and tastefully used special effects. The film is long, but worth every second of the experience, and the slightly lengthier, more detailed Special Edition version is even better than the original.\n\nOstensibly, this is a film about first contact with non-terrestrial intelligence. But the story allegorically deals with an amazing array of themes common to great dramas - violence, love, capitalism, war, courage and cowardice. The hardest, most obedient soldier in the film, played spectacularly by Michael Biehn, is a coward, and a man who is hopelessly in love with his estranged wife (Harris) turns that love into an act of suicidal heroism which might unintentionally save the world. And yet nothing is exactly as it seems to be, and there are really no spoilers in this review. There are so many subtle and sensitively developed themes in this film that it is hard to imagine a more epically human drama in the sci-fi genre. Even so, this is a film which entertains at every level, and will satisfy the action fan as much as the wannabe film critic. ;-) \n\nMost of the film takes place on an experimental submarine drilling platform owned by a petroleum company. A nuclear sub has been lost in "the abyss" - a subduction trench near the Caiman Islands - after encountering an impossibly fast object. Soon, the US military commandeers the platform and its command ship - The Benthic Explorer - to attempt a rescue mission. As everything begins to go wrong, and the encounters with strange phenomena continue, the Navy SEAL in charge of the rescue attempt begins to crack. Meanwhile, on the surface, accusations concerning the sub are escalating between the USSR and USA, and nuclear war seems immanent. This describes just a small segment of the deliciously complex plot that unfolds in The Abyss. You'll have to see it to enjoy the rest.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170619,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1989-08-09","keywords":"submarine,trapped underwater,pantyhose,ocean,drowning","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Abyss","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2643788057","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThkYjlhNGItN2Q1MC00Yjk5LWIwNzEtYWZiYjkxZDU1ZTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThkYjlhNGItN2Q1MC00Yjk5LWIwNzEtYWZiYjkxZDU1ZTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001512/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000299/","name":"Michael Biehn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092551/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"}],"duration":"PT2H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Though 20 minutes longer, it successfully wall - papers over the main points of criticism of the original. There's more humour, an explanation offered for the brothers' enmity (a valid criticism of the original) and a far more satisfactory ending, with much less ambiguity.\n\nThe Great Southern Region of Western Australia proves an excellent substitute for the admittedly stunning Icelandic rural locations and Sam Neill contributes a superlative, warmly amusing turn, as the pastoralist brother who just can't quite let go. It really is the stand-out performance of both films. Ewe shouldn't miss it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1965,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-29","keywords":"sheep,australian filmmaking,ram,animal,outback","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rams","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906346777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzViNGMwYmMtOTEyZC00Yzg1LWE0MmUtZmY3OTMzODYyMmEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzViNGMwYmMtOTEyZC00Yzg1LWE0MmUtZmY3OTMzODYyMmEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000554/","name":"Sam Neill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146264/","name":"Michael Caton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0992370/","name":"Wayne Blair"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0801327/","name":"Jeremy Sims"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0243070/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3777554/","name":"Jules Duncan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.\n\nNot that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.\n\nAs is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as "fantastic"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158698,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.\n\nAs is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as "fantastic"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158698,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

Totally agree with some other reviewers as well: this film is not meant to be taken too seriously.

All in one motion picture telling the story of "Papuszka". A true biographical movie that puts us as close as just besides her, allowing us and giving enough time to understand. \n\nThe movie tells her journey. Emotional, both tragic and beautiful moments, all did affect me very much. After watching the movie those are still in my heart like a drug, a mix of compassion, beauty and logic affecting my brain. \n\nI hope the music will or already is released separately as I became addicted to it when the movie ended and the music stopped... I just want more!\n\nHistorically, it reminds us that not only Jews were victims of holocaust, which can be easily forgotten with amount of films focusing on Jew victims. There were many other ethnic groups, but since this movie mostly focuses on telling her life not the holocaust itself, we only get a glimpse on Gypsy's holocaust.\n\nMust see for any movie lover. I give it 10 out of 10, because in my opinion this is a masterpiece that is a fine addition in the history of Polish cinema (I hope not only Polish).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1279,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-11-15","keywords":"character name as title,nickname as title,papusza character,poetess,title directed by female","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591858/","name":"Jowita Budnik"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1138580/","name":"Zbigniew Walerys"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2252397/","name":"Antoni Pawlicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All in one motion picture telling the story of "Papuszka". A true biographical movie that puts us as close as just besides her, allowing us and giving enough time to understand. \n\nThe movie tells her journey. Emotional, both tragic and beautiful moments, all did affect me very much. After watching the movie those are still in my heart like a drug, a mix of compassion, beauty and logic affecting my brain. \n\nI hope the music will or already is released separately as I became addicted to it when the movie ended and the music stopped... I just want more!\n\nHistorically, it reminds us that not only Jews were victims of holocaust, which can be easily forgotten with amount of films focusing on Jew victims. There were many other ethnic groups, but since this movie mostly focuses on telling her life not the holocaust itself, we only get a glimpse on Gypsy's holocaust.\n\nMust see for any movie lover. I give it 10 out of 10, because in my opinion this is a masterpiece that is a fine addition in the history of Polish cinema (I hope not only Polish).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1279,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-11-15","keywords":"character name as title,nickname as title,papusza character,poetess,title directed by female","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591858/","name":"Jowita Budnik","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1138580/","name":"Zbigniew Walerys","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2252397/","name":"Antoni Pawlicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.\n\nNot that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.\n\nAlas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.\n\nOne senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.\n\nTrank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. \n\nIt is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.\n\nAnd certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.\n\nAs is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as "fantastic"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158698,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

There were lots of moments of hesitation, while the crims failed in their missions and thought about what to do. The Upholster (Rebecca Gibney) was almost glamorous but wooden, despite her many excellent previous roles. I thought the fight scene with the fat guy, and his later removal from the flat funny/weird.

There were lots of moments of hesitation, while the crims failed in their missions and thought about what to do. The Upholster (Rebecca Gibney) was almost glamorous but wooden, despite her many excellent previous roles. I thought the fight scene with the fat guy, and his later removal from the flat funny/weird. I didn't like all the swearing or the motel girl getting beaten etc. I was all cringe worthy. Sorry. Try again and have some more believable likeable characters.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-10-31","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3754869017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY0MTczNTgtZGI3Mi00NWUxLTlmZDMtNWZiODEwMGU2YmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY0MTczNTgtZGI3Mi00NWUxLTlmZDMtNWZiODEwMGU2YmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lowdown Dirty Criminals is a black comedy about two friends who decide to work for an underworld character after a fiasco delivering pizza.

Tim runs towards being a dad, while Zoe runs away from being a mum. Terrified that her life won't be her own anymore, Zoe is still determined to tick off a list of their wildest dreams before the baby arrives. Zoe's increasing denial about her impending birth pushes her, and her relationship, to the limit. BABY DONE is a semi-autobiographical story inspired by the filmmakers' own reaction to starting a family.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4194124/","name":"Rose Matafeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507535/","name":"Matthew Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120593/","name":"Emily Barclay"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3555793/","name":"Curtis Vowell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0537672/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3089836/","name":"Sophie Henderson"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought I had grown tired of Jim Carrey movies. He seemed like the same character in just about every film. True enough, I can still see elements of the same kind of character in this film, but I think the story is a good one. Renee Zellwegger is lovely and sexy.

'Patrick' is his first feature film for the big screen and it is clear the director's effort to liberate himself off the pattern of the fixed formats and themes specific to television shows. The result is a strange and original film, sprinkled with many signs of directorial talent, but which at left me a bit puzzled about what it desired to convey. Of course, Tim Mielants may just have intended to demonstrate his potential, or it might have been me missing some deep meaning buried in inaccessible metaphors. Or is it some Belgian existential spleen? I suggest that you watch the movie and decide.\n\n'Patrick' (or 'De Patrick' in the original version) is the story of a confrontation with mourning. Or maybe it's the story of a lost hammer. Both variants are equally possible, and some more. The story takes place in a summer vacation resort where the vast majority of guests practice nudism. As a result the viewers are permanently confronted with the images of naked or almost naked bodies, but without any sexual connotation. The visual shock works for about five minutes, after which the nudity becomes as trivial as is probably the custom in such a holiday resort. The hero of the film, Patrick, is the janitor of the resort and the son of the owners. His father dies, a death not too unexpected, because he was seriously ill, but Patrick seems rather affected by the lack of one of the hammers in his tool kit, used to create elegant, beautifully finished wooden chairs, worthy the work of select designers. Is this obsessive search of the hammer a way to deal with grief? Is Patrick affected by any mental condition? Or is he just a simple boy who is incapable of communicating, who has not had the time in his 38 years of life to know the world? Or maybe he is doing the most logical thing of all. After all the father's death is irreversible, but the missing hammer can be found, and then his world order is - to the possible extent - restored. The answer is left to the viewers, I have not been able to reach any conclusion.\n\nPatrick's role is played by Kevin Janssens, an actor who also comes with an extensive television experience. His character is closed on itself, but despite the lack of communication or perhaps because of it, he manages to generate empathy. The rest of the distribution contributes to the creation of a strange, slightly absurd atmosphere. The practice of nudism has as an 'ideological' purpose the elimination of social barriers, but the the more naked the characters are, the more anti-socially they behave. What would have been left of the story if the action had not taken place in a nudism village? The story manages to catch the attention for most of the time, oscillating between social satire with absurd and grotesque nuances, and police mystery with hints of horror. There are many interesting elements in Tim Mielants' film, including some scenes in which the nature of the Ardennes with the sun hardly creeping through the trees of dizzying verticality plays an important role. At least one scene, that of the funerals, has a wonderful cinematic beauty. 'Patrick' announces, I hope, the career of a talented director. I hope that he will also find consistent stakes in the subjects of his upcoming films, in order to harness this potential.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-08-28","keywords":"nudity,male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,public nudity,nudism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Patrick","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663038745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg0NGNiZGYtZDcyMS00ZjQ0LTgzZjAtYzI0N2Y4YjNkYTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg0NGNiZGYtZDcyMS00ZjQ0LTgzZjAtYzI0N2Y4YjNkYTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1822271/","name":"Kevin Janssens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0198705/","name":"Katelijne Damen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4142492/","name":"Hannah Hoekstra"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2139803/","name":"Tim Mielants"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282520/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0364126/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071388/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2139803/","name":"Tim Mielants"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2130385/","name":"Benjamin Sprengers"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is set July 18 , 1936 , Salamanca, Castilla and León (center to Spain) , as the Spanish army declares in the city the state of wa r, hoping to extend it to the rest of Spain and improve the unstable situation in the country after the proclamation of the Second Republic five years ago . Here Unamuno (Karra Elejalde) supports the new revolt in the hope to clean the country of the undesirable elements for desperation of his close friends teacher Salvador and priest Atilano, creating too problems in his house where Miguel lives with his daughters María (Patricia López Arnaiz) and Felisa (Inma Cuevas) , his servant Aurelia and his grandson Miguelín (Arnau) . At the same time that Salamanca's mayor Casto Prieto (Mariano Llorente) is detained without cause apparent and his spouse Ana Carrasco (Nathalie Poza) asks help Miguel de Unamuno . While Joint Chiefs of Staff meet deciding the strategy to take the power , where General Astray-Millán (Eduard Fernandez) , General Franco's right-hand, proposes to elect the own Franco as leader despite the opposition of General Cabanellas (Tito Valverde) , who fears Franco eliminates the Republic he loves to change it for a dictatorship . When Atilano (Luis Zahera) disappears suddenly , his wife Enriqueta reports Miguel de Unamuno about his arrest while Salvador (Carlos Serrano) attempts to alert him about the real intentions of the military revolution : turn Spain into a rigid dictatorship. As Francisco Franco (Santi Prego) is named Chief of Staff of the Spanish Army and Unamuno decides to make him a special request . Later on , Unamuno had a public quarrel with the Nationalist general Millán Astray at the university in which he denounced both Astray-with whom he had had verbal battles in the 1920s-and elements of the rebel movement. He called the battle cry of the elite Spanish Legion-"Long live death!"-repellent and suggested Astray wanted to see Spain crippled. One historian notes that his address was a "remarkable act of moral courage" and that he risked being lynched on the spot but was saved by Franco's wife, who took him out of the place . Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was effectively removed for a second time from the rectorship of the University of Salamanca .\n\nA good drama based on historical events , though the film has several errors and false remarks . It narrates itself Unamuno's life in Salamanca , being first-hand witness of the deeds that will change Spain forever. Here Unamuno is a contradictory , reluctant , complex person who finally becomes an ashamed and sad man , questioning himself and his previous posture . Karra Elejalde delivers a terrific acting as an aging Miguel de Unamuno, not only writer and academic teacher but one of the most recognized intellectuals in Spain, disappointed with the Republic that publicly he helped to create . While Eduard Fernandez gives a fine performance as the relentless one-eyed, one-armed and one-legged General Millan Astray , though overacting , at times ; as Eduard deservedly won a Goya Award : the best support cast . In the picture appears various historical characters represented by fine secondary actors , such as : Tito Valverde as General Miguel Cabanellas , Luis Callejo as General Mola , Luis Bermejo as Nicolás Franco , Enrique Ajenjo as José Maria Pemán , Santi Prego as General Francisco Franco who gets complete political and military powers after the Alcázar de Toledo's battle and Mireia Rey as his wife Carmen Polo .\n\nIt contains an evocative and adequate cinematography by Alex Catalán . As well as a sensitive and exciting musical score by Amenabar himself . The motion picture was well directed by Alejandro Amenábar . At his beginning Amenábar made some Short-Films , he progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis" produced by José Luis Cuerda , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene. Later "Abre Los Ojos" or ¨Open your eyes¨(1997) was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise and "Los Otros" or ¨The Others¨ confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world , in which Tom Cruise was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros" enhanced his prestige in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films he also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films, most notably "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (1999) or Butterflies tongue" (1999). He also directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz , among others .\n\n This film ¨Mientras dure la guerra¨ is based on facts , the actual happenings are as follows : On 12 October 1936 the celebration of Columbus Day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Martínez-Valdés, the wife of Franco, Falangist General José Millán Astray and Unamuno himself. The evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer José María Pemán. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as "cancers on the body of the nation," adding that "Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism" .From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto "¡Viva la Muerte!" . As was his habit, Millán Astray responded with "¡España!"; the crowd replied with "¡Una!" . He repeated "¡España!"; the crowd then replied "¡Grande!" . A third time, Millán Astray shouted "¡España!"; the crowd responded "Libre!"This - Spain, one, great and free - was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. Then Unamuno adressed the crowd : I have heard this insensitive and necrophilous oath, "¡Viva la Muerte!", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Millán Astray is a cripple. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is a war cripple. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many cripples. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Millán Astray could dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. A cripple, who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes, hopes to find relief by adding to the number of cripples around him. Millán Astray responded: "Death to intelligence! Long live death!" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pemán, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed "No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!" Unamuno continued: "This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win , because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince . In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken." Millán Astray, controlling himself, shouted "Take the lady's arm!" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-27","keywords":"spanish civil war,1930s,year 1936,general franco,based on real events","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4248288281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253216/","name":"Karra Elejalde"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273464/","name":"Eduard Fernández"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1139204/","name":"Santi Prego"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233438/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0101420/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379864/","name":"Alejandro Hernández"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was effectively removed for a second time from the rectorship of the University of Salamanca .\n\nA good drama based on historical events , though the film has several errors and false remarks . It narrates itself Unamuno's life in Salamanca , being first-hand witness of the deeds that will change Spain forever. Here Unamuno is a contradictory , reluctant , complex person who finally becomes an ashamed and sad man , questioning himself and his previous posture . Karra Elejalde delivers a terrific acting as an aging Miguel de Unamuno, not only writer and academic teacher but one of the most recognized intellectuals in Spain, disappointed with the Republic that publicly he helped to create . While Eduard Fernandez gives a fine performance as the relentless one-eyed, one-armed and one-legged General Millan Astray , though overacting , at times ; as Eduard deservedly won a Goya Award : the best support cast . In the picture appears various historical characters represented by fine secondary actors , such as : Tito Valverde as General Miguel Cabanellas , Luis Callejo as General Mola , Luis Bermejo as Nicolás Franco , Enrique Ajenjo as José Maria Pemán , Santi Prego as General Francisco Franco who gets complete political and military powers after the Alcázar de Toledo's battle and Mireia Rey as his wife Carmen Polo .\n\nIt contains an evocative and adequate cinematography by Alex Catalán . As well as a sensitive and exciting musical score by Amenabar himself . The motion picture was well directed by Alejandro Amenábar . At his beginning Amenábar made some Short-Films , he progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis" produced by José Luis Cuerda , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene. Later "Abre Los Ojos" or ¨Open your eyes¨(1997) was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise and "Los Otros" or ¨The Others¨ confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world , in which Tom Cruise was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros" enhanced his prestige in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films he also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films, most notably "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (1999) or Butterflies tongue" (1999). He also directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz , among others .\n\n This film ¨Mientras dure la guerra¨ is based on facts , the actual happenings are as follows : On 12 October 1936 the celebration of Columbus Day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Martínez-Valdés, the wife of Franco, Falangist General José Millán Astray and Unamuno himself. The evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer José María Pemán. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as "cancers on the body of the nation," adding that "Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism" .From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto "¡Viva la Muerte!" . As was his habit, Millán Astray responded with "¡España!"; the crowd replied with "¡Una!" . He repeated "¡España!"; the crowd then replied "¡Grande!" . A third time, Millán Astray shouted "¡España!"; the crowd responded "Libre!"This - Spain, one, great and free - was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. Then Unamuno adressed the crowd : I have heard this insensitive and necrophilous oath, "¡Viva la Muerte!", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Millán Astray is a cripple. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is a war cripple. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many cripples. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Millán Astray could dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. A cripple, who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes, hopes to find relief by adding to the number of cripples around him. Millán Astray responded: "Death to intelligence! Long live death!" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pemán, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed "No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!" Unamuno continued: "This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win , because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince . In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken." Millán Astray, controlling himself, shouted "Take the lady's arm!" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-27","keywords":"spanish civil war,1930s,year 1936,general franco,based on real events","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4248288281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253216/","name":"Karra Elejalde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273464/","name":"Eduard Fernández","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1139204/","name":"Santi Prego"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233438/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0101420/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379864/","name":"Alejandro Hernández"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The result is a strange and original film, sprinkled with many signs of directorial talent, but which at left me a bit puzzled about what it desired to convey. Of course, Tim Mielants may just have intended to demonstrate his potential, or it might have been me missing some deep meaning buried in inaccessible metaphors. Or is it some Belgian existential spleen? I suggest that you watch the movie and decide.\n\n'Patrick' (or 'De Patrick' in the original version) is the story of a confrontation with mourning. Or maybe it's the story of a lost hammer. Both variants are equally possible, and some more. The story takes place in a summer vacation resort where the vast majority of guests practice nudism. As a result the viewers are permanently confronted with the images of naked or almost naked bodies, but without any sexual connotation.

The hero of the film, Patrick, is the janitor of the resort and the son of the owners. His father dies, a death not too unexpected, because he was seriously ill, but Patrick seems rather affected by the lack of one of the hammers in his tool kit, used to create elegant, beautifully finished wooden chairs, worthy the work of select designers. Is this obsessive search of the hammer a way to deal with grief? Is Patrick affected by any mental condition? Or is he just a simple boy who is incapable of communicating, who has not had the time in his 38 years of life to know the world? Or maybe he is doing the most logical thing of all. After all the father's death is irreversible, but the missing hammer can be found, and then his world order is - to the possible extent - restored. The answer is left to the viewers, I have not been able to reach any conclusion.\n\nPatrick's role is played by Kevin Janssens, an actor who also comes with an extensive television experience. His character is closed on itself, but despite the lack of communication or perhaps because of it, he manages to generate empathy. The rest of the distribution contributes to the creation of a strange, slightly absurd atmosphere. The practice of nudism has as an 'ideological' purpose the elimination of social barriers, but the the more naked the characters are, the more anti-socially they behave. What would have been left of the story if the action had not taken place in a nudism village? The story manages to catch the attention for most of the time, oscillating between social satire with absurd and grotesque nuances, and police mystery with hints of horror. There are many interesting elements in Tim Mielants' film, including some scenes in which the nature of the Ardennes with the sun hardly creeping through the trees of dizzying verticality plays an important role. At least one scene, that of the funerals, has a wonderful cinematic beauty. 'Patrick' announces, I hope, the career of a talented director. I hope that he will also find consistent stakes in the subjects of his upcoming films, in order to harness this potential.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-08-28","keywords":"nudity,male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,public nudity,nudism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Patrick","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663038745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg0NGNiZGYtZDcyMS00ZjQ0LTgzZjAtYzI0N2Y4YjNkYTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg0NGNiZGYtZDcyMS00ZjQ0LTgzZjAtYzI0N2Y4YjNkYTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1822271/","name":"Kevin Janssens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0198705/","name":"Katelijne Damen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4142492/","name":"Hannah Hoekstra"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2139803/","name":"Tim Mielants"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282520/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0364126/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071388/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2139803/","name":"Tim Mielants"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2130385/","name":"Benjamin Sprengers"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The answer is left to the viewers, I have not been able to reach any conclusion.\n\nPatrick's role is played by Kevin Janssens, an actor who also comes with an extensive television experience. His character is closed on itself, but despite the lack of communication or perhaps because of it, he manages to generate empathy. The rest of the distribution contributes to the creation of a strange, slightly absurd atmosphere. The practice of nudism has as an 'ideological' purpose the elimination of social barriers, but the the more naked the characters are, the more anti-socially they behave. What would have been left of the story if the action had not taken place in a nudism village? The story manages to catch the attention for most of the time, oscillating between social satire with absurd and grotesque nuances, and police mystery with hints of horror. There are many interesting elements in Tim Mielants' film, including some scenes in which the nature of the Ardennes with the sun hardly creeping through the trees of dizzying verticality plays an important role. At least one scene, that of the funerals, has a wonderful cinematic beauty. 'Patrick' announces, I hope, the career of a talented director. I hope that he will also find consistent stakes in the subjects of his upcoming films, in order to harness this potential.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-08-28","keywords":"nudity,male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,public nudity,nudism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Patrick","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663038745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg0NGNiZGYtZDcyMS00ZjQ0LTgzZjAtYzI0N2Y4YjNkYTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg0NGNiZGYtZDcyMS00ZjQ0LTgzZjAtYzI0N2Y4YjNkYTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1822271/","name":"Kevin Janssens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0198705/","name":"Katelijne Damen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4142492/","name":"Hannah Hoekstra"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2139803/","name":"Tim Mielants"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282520/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0364126/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071388/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2139803/","name":"Tim Mielants","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2130385/","name":"Benjamin Sprengers"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is set July 18 , 1936 , Salamanca, Castilla and León (center to Spain) , as the Spanish army declares in the city the state of wa r, hoping to extend it to the rest of Spain and improve the unstable situation in the country after the proclamation of the Second Republic five years ago . Here Unamuno (Karra Elejalde) supports the new revolt in the hope to clean the country of the undesirable elements for desperation of his close friends teacher Salvador and priest Atilano, creating too problems in his house where Miguel lives with his daughters María (Patricia López Arnaiz) and Felisa (Inma Cuevas) , his servant Aurelia and his grandson Miguelín (Arnau) . At the same time that Salamanca's mayor Casto Prieto (Mariano Llorente) is detained without cause apparent and his spouse Ana Carrasco (Nathalie Poza) asks help Miguel de Unamuno . While Joint Chiefs of Staff meet deciding the strategy to take the power , where General Astray-Millán (Eduard Fernandez) , General Franco's right-hand, proposes to elect the own Franco as leader despite the opposition of General Cabanellas (Tito Valverde) , who fears Franco eliminates the Republic he loves to change it for a dictatorship . When Atilano (Luis Zahera) disappears suddenly , his wife Enriqueta reports Miguel de Unamuno about his arrest while Salvador (Carlos Serrano) attempts to alert him about the real intentions of the military revolution : turn Spain into a rigid dictatorship. As Francisco Franco (Santi Prego) is named Chief of Staff of the Spanish Army and Unamuno decides to make him a special request . Later on , Unamuno had a public quarrel with the Nationalist general Millán Astray at the university in which he denounced both Astray-with whom he had had verbal battles in the 1920s-and elements of the rebel movement. He called the battle cry of the elite Spanish Legion-"Long live death!"-repellent and suggested Astray wanted to see Spain crippled. One historian notes that his address was a "remarkable act of moral courage" and that he risked being lynched on the spot but was saved by Franco's wife, who took him out of the place . Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was effectively removed for a second time from the rectorship of the University of Salamanca .\n\nA good drama based on historical events , though the film has several errors and false remarks . It narrates itself Unamuno's life in Salamanca , being first-hand witness of the deeds that will change Spain forever. Here Unamuno is a contradictory , reluctant , complex person who finally becomes an ashamed and sad man , questioning himself and his previous posture . Karra Elejalde delivers a terrific acting as an aging Miguel de Unamuno, not only writer and academic teacher but one of the most recognized intellectuals in Spain, disappointed with the Republic that publicly he helped to create . While Eduard Fernandez gives a fine performance as the relentless one-eyed, one-armed and one-legged General Millan Astray , though overacting , at times ; as Eduard deservedly won a Goya Award : the best support cast . In the picture appears various historical characters represented by fine secondary actors , such as : Tito Valverde as General Miguel Cabanellas , Luis Callejo as General Mola , Luis Bermejo as Nicolás Franco , Enrique Ajenjo as José Maria Pemán , Santi Prego as General Francisco Franco who gets complete political and military powers after the Alcázar de Toledo's battle and Mireia Rey as his wife Carmen Polo .\n\nIt contains an evocative and adequate cinematography by Alex Catalán . As well as a sensitive and exciting musical score by Amenabar himself . The motion picture was well directed by Alejandro Amenábar . At his beginning Amenábar made some Short-Films , he progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis" produced by José Luis Cuerda , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene. Later "Abre Los Ojos" or ¨Open your eyes¨(1997) was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise and "Los Otros" or ¨The Others¨ confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world , in which Tom Cruise was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros" enhanced his prestige in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films he also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films, most notably "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (1999) or Butterflies tongue" (1999). He also directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz , among others .\n\n This film ¨Mientras dure la guerra¨ is based on facts , the actual happenings are as follows : On 12 October 1936 the celebration of Columbus Day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Martínez-Valdés, the wife of Franco, Falangist General José Millán Astray and Unamuno himself. The evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer José María Pemán. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as "cancers on the body of the nation," adding that "Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism" .From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto "¡Viva la Muerte!" . As was his habit, Millán Astray responded with "¡España!"; the crowd replied with "¡Una!" . He repeated "¡España!"; the crowd then replied "¡Grande!" . A third time, Millán Astray shouted "¡España!"; the crowd responded "Libre!"This - Spain, one, great and free - was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. Then Unamuno adressed the crowd : I have heard this insensitive and necrophilous oath, "¡Viva la Muerte!", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Millán Astray is a cripple. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is a war cripple. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many cripples. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Millán Astray could dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. A cripple, who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes, hopes to find relief by adding to the number of cripples around him. Millán Astray responded: "Death to intelligence! Long live death!" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pemán, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed "No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!" Unamuno continued: "This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win , because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince . In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken." Millán Astray, controlling himself, shouted "Take the lady's arm!" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-27","keywords":"spanish civil war,1930s,year 1936,general franco,based on real events","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4248288281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253216/","name":"Karra Elejalde"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273464/","name":"Eduard Fernández"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1139204/","name":"Santi Prego"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233438/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0101420/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379864/","name":"Alejandro Hernández"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then Unamuno adressed the crowd : I have heard this insensitive and necrophilous oath, "¡Viva la Muerte!", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Millán Astray is a cripple. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is a war cripple. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many cripples. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Millán Astray could dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. A cripple, who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes, hopes to find relief by adding to the number of cripples around him. Millán Astray responded: "Death to intelligence! Long live death!" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pemán, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed "No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!" Unamuno continued: "This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win , because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince . In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken." Millán Astray, controlling himself, shouted "Take the lady's arm!" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-27","keywords":"spanish civil war,1930s,year 1936,general franco,based on real events","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4248288281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253216/","name":"Karra Elejalde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273464/","name":"Eduard Fernández","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1139204/","name":"Santi Prego"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233438/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0101420/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379864/","name":"Alejandro Hernández"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I suggest that there are a lot of other movies out there who will shock and offend you a whole lot more than this one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2010-10-27","keywords":"brothel,nudity,racism,exhibition,female nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135788313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MzZhZjUtNmU4MC00NjcxLWI1NDktYTRjNDY1NmVlMDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MzZhZjUtNmU4MC00NjcxLWI1NDktYTRjNDY1NmVlMDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4070086/","name":"Yahima Torres","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414325/","name":"Andre Jacobs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332709/","name":"Olivier Gourmet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444244/","name":"Abdellatif Kechiche"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028908/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444244/","name":"Abdellatif Kechiche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480308/","name":"Ghalya Lacroix"],"duration":"PT2H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All around, I very much recommend this film, and am very happy to see this subject matter be handled so well and compassionately.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":793,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-12","keywords":"prostitution,male frontal nudity,male nudity,female nudity,sex work","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3466837529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEzMzA1ZTUtMGFkYS00NzhjLWI1YTktNmI0NjExMWUwOGY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEzMzA1ZTUtMGFkYS00NzhjLWI1YTktNmI0NjExMWUwOGY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271759/","name":"Sara Forestier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527852/","name":"Noémie Lvovsky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4779334/","name":"Annabelle Lengronne"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285090/","name":"Frédéric Fonteyne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2973991/","name":"Anne Paulicevich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071388/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048473/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2973991/","name":"Anne Paulicevich"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You don't watch a movie - you experience a real time and place. I happen to love a bunch of Paul Newman's films (The 3 H's - Hud, Hombre and Harper; Cool Hand Luke; The Sting; The Hustler; The Color of Money...), but I'm not what you'd call a rabid fan. I think he is compelling, but has a fairly limited range. He is perfect in this role, but it isn't much different from The Hustler or Cool Hand Luke. However, watching Melvyn Douglas is like watching somebody that Marty Ritt pulled off of some ranch and filmed in his daily life. His performance is absolutely dead- on. The gravelly drawl, the old boy shuffle, his expression - the way his eyes take in the landscape or gaze intently into a bowl of ice cream while Hud talks - all incredibly REAL! I KNOW those old guys!\n\nMelvyn Douglas is a truly under-appreciated American acting genius whose career spanned over 5 decades. His range is tremendous. This is the same honey-tongued actor who is the perfect comic foil to Garbo's Ninotchka in the '30's (In fact, he is one of her only REPEAT leading men!) And his bluster-filled performance in I Never Sang for My Father (with another modern great, Gene Hackman) is also out of this world! Other commentators have addressed Hud's multi-faceted story and the incredible B&amp;W cinematography. All wonderful - but the next time you watch this true American classic, focus on Douglas' Oscar-winning performance. You will be amazed!

Of course, the big money doesn't come about here, but the production is based on such an assessment, for example in the form of crowdfunding. In addition, the characters are pale and very much reduced to their sexual identity. Of course, that's what the film is about, but multifacetedness seems to be a word of yesterday far too often for modern filmmakers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-20","keywords":"title directed by female,f rated,triple f rated,female protagonist,no opening credits","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10275870/","name":"Lucía Bedoya","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10275871/","name":"Belkis Avilladares","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5913510/","name":"María Elena Duque"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952204/","name":"Patricia Ortega"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0260424/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0722760/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2989037/","name":"Enmanuel Chávez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952204/","name":"Patricia Ortega"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Maria (Luise Wolfram) wyjeżdża z Niemiec, aby odwiedzić w Tel Awiwie swoją kochankę Shirę (Moran Rosenblatt). Dochodzi do zderzenia dwóch skrajnie różnych kultur i obyczajów, a mała, pozornie nic nieznacząca pomyłka staje się przyczyną poważnego zamieszania. Dwie niemal obce sobie rodziny muszą oswoić się z perspektywą wspólnej przyszłości. Wkrótce sytuacja komplikuje się jeszcze bardziej. Film został wyróżniony nagrodą na Jewish Film Festival.</desc>

You don't watch a movie - you experience a real time and place. I happen to love a bunch of Paul Newman's films (The 3 H's - Hud, Hombre and Harper; Cool Hand Luke; The Sting; The Hustler; The Color of Money...), but I'm not what you'd call a rabid fan. I think he is compelling, but has a fairly limited range. He is perfect in this role, but it isn't much different from The Hustler or Cool Hand Luke. However, watching Melvyn Douglas is like watching somebody that Marty Ritt pulled off of some ranch and filmed in his daily life. His performance is absolutely dead- on. The gravelly drawl, the old boy shuffle, his expression - the way his eyes take in the landscape or gaze intently into a bowl of ice cream while Hud talks - all incredibly REAL! I KNOW those old guys!\n\nMelvyn Douglas is a truly under-appreciated American acting genius whose career spanned over 5 decades. His range is tremendous. This is the same honey-tongued actor who is the perfect comic foil to Garbo's Ninotchka in the '30's (In fact, he is one of her only REPEAT leading men!) And his bluster-filled performance in I Never Sang for My Father (with another modern great, Gene Hackman) is also out of this world! Other commentators have addressed Hud's multi-faceted story and the incredible B&amp;W cinematography. All wonderful - but the next time you watch this true American classic, focus on Douglas' Oscar-winning performance. You will be amazed!

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood.

I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present. The actors played their roles well and realistic, while I give credit to the director for packing so much real-life' into a small movie.\n\nI really did enjoy and digest this great story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":997,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980416025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After 15 years in prison, Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) reunites with his high school girlfriend, Dolores (Jena Malone), who is now a single mother of three.

In fact, it's a sure sign of cancellation how much I like this show. I never like crime shows. My mom loves them, but I find them dull, because they're about plots not characters.

I expect good things from it.\n\nAlison","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-09-13","keywords":"forensic anthropologist,investigation,washington d.c.,crime scene investigation,murder investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0221043/","name":"Emily Deschanel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004770/","name":"David Boreanaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174819/","name":"Michaela Conlin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0212869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0361274/","name":"Hart Hanson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bones: The Complete Seventh Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi748140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bones: The Complete Seventh Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. \n\nAs always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-26","keywords":"vigilante,prostitute,mysterious past,gangster,ex soldier","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1649060889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A former black ops commando who faked his death for a quiet life in Boston comes out of his retirement to rescue a young girl and finds himself face to face with Russian gangsters.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631269/","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0479739/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921013/","name":"Richard Wenk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805994/","name":"Michael Sloan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2030456/","name":"Richard Lindheim"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect - it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues. It's the reason you go to the cinema.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321812,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-04","keywords":"time travel,father son relationship,family relationships,wedding,marriage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi802400281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTAyNzgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ4ODI1MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTAyNzgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ4ODI1MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"At the age of 21, Tim discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his own life.

For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect - it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues. It's the reason you go to the cinema.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321812,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-04","keywords":"time travel,father son relationship,family relationships,wedding,marriage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi802400281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTAyNzgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ4ODI1MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTAyNzgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ4ODI1MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"At the age of 21, Tim discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his own life.

And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix, you'd have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale, where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.\n\nI thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves, i.e. one's dating an older woman, the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well, at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages, but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles, Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets, and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie, since she has on display, really menacing looking biceps, and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.\n\nKutcher on the other hand is, well, Kutcher from Punk'd, with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead, the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater, Fuller's best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, and I'd stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies, as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.\n\nAt best, What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic- comedy from the factories of Hollywood, or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer.

I've since watched it multiple times with other friends. And each time, left feeling the same. Now, with such high regard for the first one, naturally I went into this movie, with extremely high expectations. I was NOT disappointed. Not even remotely. It was twice as breathtaking, twice as exhilarating, and endlessly more brutal. A stunning movie. Evans, is unbelievable. His eye for what people want in an action movie is impeccable.The car chase scene (my favorite scene) was one of the best I've seen in recent history. Which is made more impressive by the fact the it was gareths first attempt at directing such a scene. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe the hype.

They work well together &amp; I really liked seeing a romantic comedy involving a mature couple &amp; thinking about whats been just "enough" in life. I'd say the main charachter is the Scottish scenery ! Filmed at Ardkinglas Estate &amp; around Cairndow in the Argylle/Bute area of Scottish Highlands. Its beautiful. (This film is absolutely nothing like current Hollywood movies with aging actors like Diane Keaton or Robert Deniro, and thats a good thing !!)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1440,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-10-02","keywords":"widow","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1453572377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU0Nzc4NjAtY2ZiNy00NTI3LTgzMWMtOTI1YTU0ODA0YmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU0Nzc4NjAtY2ZiNy00NTI3LTgzMWMtOTI1YTU0ODA0YmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A lonely widow plans a trip around the world with her husband's ashes, to visit the places they loved in the movies.

    <desc lang="pl">Intrigo: Samaria: Directed by Daniel Alfredson. With Phoebe Fox, Andrew Buchan, Millie Brady, Jeff Fahey. Nineteen-year-old Vera Kall cycles home through the night. She arrives at a farm, leaves her bike and sneaks quietly in through the door. She enters the kitchen and doesn't even have time to notice that she's not alone. The sudden blow is heavy and knocks Vera headlong onto the kitchen floor where she is left lying. Henry is a successful copywriter in Antwerp. One day he is approached by Paula, a documentary filmmaker. Ten years earlier, she was Vera's classmate. Now she plans to make a film about Vera and wants Henry to become involved as he was their teacher back then in the city of Münster. Despite his plea of innocence Jakob Kall sits imprisoned for the murder of his daughter. This tragic and brutal story brings Paula and Henry together as they search for the truth behind what really happened, and why Vera's body was never found. Both Henry and Paula carry well-hidden secrets which are slowly and inexorably forced out into the open. But the big question remains; is the man incarcerated in the maximum-security section of Bittinger prison really Vera's killer?" data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt6341108/","name":"Intrigo: Samaria","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNlNTY5YWEtNTVlOC00MjllLWI2YmQtOTljY2FlMWRjYjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTg4MDYyNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Nineteen-year-old Vera Kall cycles home through the night.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 6341108, Title: Intrigo: Samaria, 
 --- Description: Intrigo: Samaria: Directed by Daniel Alfredson. With Phoebe Fox, Andrew Buchan, Millie Brady, Jeff Fahey. Nineteen-year-old Vera Kall cycles home through the night. She arrives at a farm, leaves her bike and sneaks quietly in through the door. She enters the kitchen and doesn't even have time to notice that she's not alone. The sudden blow is heavy and knocks Vera headlong onto the kitchen floor where she is left lying. Henry is a successful copywriter in Antwerp. One day he is approached by Paula, a documentary filmmaker. Ten years earlier, she was Vera's classmate. Now she plans to make a film about Vera and wants Henry to become involved as he was their teacher back then in the city of Münster. Despite his plea of innocence Jakob Kall sits imprisoned for the murder of his daughter. This tragic and brutal story brings Paula and Henry together as they search for the truth behind what really happened, and why Vera's body was never found. Both Henry and Paula carry well-hidden secrets which are slowly and inexorably forced out into the open. But the big question remains; is the man incarcerated in the maximum-security section of Bittinger prison really Vera's killer?" data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt6341108/","name":"Intrigo: Samaria","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNlNTY5YWEtNTVlOC00MjllLWI2YmQtOTljY2FlMWRjYjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTg4MDYyNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Nineteen-year-old Vera Kall cycles home through the night.

The sudden blow is heavy and knocks Vera headlong onto the kitchen floor where she is left lying. Henry is a successful copywriter in Antwerp.

Other than those things, it's average. If you've never seen a superhero movie and/or are a Green Lantern fan, this movie is worth seeing. Everyone else should see X-Men: First Class.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":275741,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.

If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my "seeing as many 2018 films as possible" quest.\n\nThis is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.\n\nMany kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.\n\nOne of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":696634,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3115057433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001321/","name":"Richard Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.\n\nMany kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.\n\nOne of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":696634,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3115057433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001321/","name":"Richard Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

(2001) **** (Voices of: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Mary Gibbs, Bonnie Hunt, Bob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank Oz, Steve Susskind, Jeff Pidgeon, Sam "Penguin" Black, Daniel R. Gerson. (Dir: Peter Docter/Co-directors: David Silverman, Lee Unkrich)\n\nThere's something undeniably magical about a Disney movie that brings out your inner child and the streak continues to manifest itself in the latest with its fine track record with upstarts Pixar (the "Toy Story " films) in delighting children of all ages in one of the year's funniest (and most fun) films.\n\nThe childhood phenomena of imagining monsters lurking in one's bedroom closet or under the bed is in actuality a reality that exists solely for the world of the monsters to use all the energy extracted from a child's screams as their natural resource to power their communities and subsist in their parallel universe. Specifically Scream Heat ("We Scare Because We Care"), the corporate entity that harnesses the youngsters' reactions to its hard-working crew of creatures including our heroes James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (marvelously voiced by Goodman) and his best buddy Mike Wazowski (ditto Crystal). Sulley is a bear-like, blue and purple hairy and horned monster and Mike is a cyclopean lime green M&amp;M clone. The two couldn't be more different yet both share their passion for their vocation and the only thing getting in their way is their rival colleague Randall Boggs (Buscemi, at his oiliest menacing), a reptilian nasty who wants to beat Sulley for the all-time factory record of most points racked up in a single day on the job   at any cost. Watching the proceedings is Sulley's father-figure boss Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn) – a cross between a crab and Edward G. Robinson – whose main priority is avoiding any "rolling blackouts" (in one of the film's subtle jabs at the current climate in our nation). Mike is in love with cutie pie receptionist Celia (Tilly) who also sports one eye and is afoot taller than him, with a hairdo sporting a Medusa twist (snakes sit atop her head) who wants something from him besides excuses to their frequently put-upon dates together. One day after work Sulley accidentally lets into their world a tiny 4 year old girl – a big no-no – legend has it that one touch is toxic and fatal! – which causes mass havoc wreaked upon the populace as the authorities attempt to corral the tyke while decontaminating the infected workshop's workers (a running gag has the SWAT like DEA agents popping in at a moment's notice whenever a sign of human contact – i.e. a small cotton white sock attached to an unsuspecting monster – makes its ugly presence known!) Mike is in a panicky sweat that they will lose their jobs and tells Sulley he can't hide Boo (the nickname the big guy dubs the adorable tot) and they must return her to her bedroom. Easier said than done when Randall gets wind of the partners abetting the unsuspecting crime and he too has his plans to use Boo for his own selfish endeavors at any cost! The film is a laugh a minute romp and an incredible mix of state-of-the-art computer generated dynamics that truly enhance the candy-colored world of Mike &amp; Sulley with its picture perfect depictions of moveable hair (see how Sulley's locks sway to and fro so naturally! A first for CGI imagery!) and expressiveness given to the one-eyed Mike who works his brow into a real sweat. Never before has voice talent been so perfectly matched and acted to a t than in the comic team of Crystal and Goodman with their characteristics smartly enhanced into their characters with Crystal's liberal use of his "SNL" Willy the Masochist ("Oh I hate when that happens!") and Goodman's burly, awshucks demeanor fits his soft-hearted meanie like a golden glove. Sulley is the true star of the show with his emotional overload not unlike a kid learning to make a new life transition as he discovers there's more to his existence than meets the eye (same for Mike; pun intended). When he realizes that Boo (by the way, nice job by the producers to use real-life 4 year old Gibbs, in easily the cutest turn by a child performer ever without making an audience gag) is not threatened by his hulking presence. The laughs are largely thanks to Crystal's myopic M&amp;M who is always one-step behind his behemoth buddy and slow on the uptake as the plot proceeds with his sly one-liners, sudden bursts of unrestrained anger and confusion, and slapstick antics leads the film into uncharted territories of hysterical laughter and a great breakneck roller-coaster ride with Mike &amp; Sulley attempting to find Boo's bedroom door with Randall in hot pursuit gives the film a giddy headrush of adrenaline. The film is witty, bright, upbeat and has its shares of incisiveness (I loved the use of HarryHausen's as a local chic eatery that all the monsters are dying to get into; in case of those who don't know Harryhausen, Ray Harryhausen, is the premier stop-motion animator pioneer who gave life to scores of sci-fi creatures including the fabled "Sinbad" flicks of the 1960s and 1970s among others) that will undoubtedly have its constituents clamoring for a sequel pronto.

Arguably one of the best films and funniest of the year; I loved it and so will you (and your kids if you have any; if not all the more to see it again) An instant classic.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":852143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-04-10","keywords":"monster world,monster,human nonhuman relationship,portal door,scream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi518890521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc5NTE4OTI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc5NTE4OTI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley finds his world disrupted.

What I loved about the first one was it's rawness, it's artiness, it's intellect. No one, besides Bette maybe, was established and you're watching this group of gay friends find their way in life with all the drama in tow. Some storylines were risqué for the time, which made it all the more interesting. Cut to now and all of our beloved characters are well established, living these high flying lives that just seems so untrue to the characters that they were and it takes away a certain quality and relatability from them. We're now expected to find this in these new characters but the writing just doesn't quite live up to that same quirky standard. I understand this is a different show and perhaps they had to sell it that way to bring it back, perhaps they felt they needed a younger generation for a younger audience to relate to. It's not a bad show and the new characters aren't terrible, but there's a certain depth missing here.

What those "drama critics" don't seem to understand is that all his comedy movies are PARODIES of dramatic movies. They're not supposed to be taken seriously.

Leslie Nielsen was perfect to play this role simply because he has the presence of a dramatic actor only making his actions funnier. Nielsen is perhaps one of the funniest comedic actors around, though his movies like this are criticized as though they were supposed to be some Oscar Nomminated hit or something. What those "drama critics" don't seem to understand is that all his comedy movies are PARODIES of dramatic movies. They're not supposed to be taken seriously. Niesen movies like this are just for a few yuks and laughs. I have always loved random comedy movies like this, therefore, I love this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24711,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1998-07-23","keywords":"satire,satirical,sex,violin,one legged man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wrongfully Accused","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1979580697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdkN2VmZjktYzRhZC00NDQ5LWJkMTItMWY3NjJmZDA2YTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdkN2VmZjktYzRhZC00NDQ5LWJkMTItMWY3NjJmZDA2YTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000558/","name":"Leslie Nielsen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001077/","name":"Richard Crenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001456/","name":"Kelly LeBrock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698493/","name":"Pat Proft"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698493/","name":"Pat Proft"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.\n\nDerek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-02-27","keywords":"male model,fashion model,conspiracy,fashion,malaysia","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852132/","name":"Christine Taylor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045189/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766153/","name":"Drake Sather"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357453/","name":"John Hamburg"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It carried a genuine tongue-in-cheek mockery of the entire industry and blew up 'their' ridiculousness to the max. \n\nLets begin with the positive: Kristen Wiig as Alexanya Atoz is pure performance art. The styling and make-up is so on point. But even more impressive is her wicked accent. It was, hands down, the funniest aspect of the film. Every time she opened her mouth I died. Could not contain the laughter. Her dedication to that character's weird speech pattern was super impressive. The cameo performances were a delight in the original and that has managed to follow through effortlessly. More cameo's that are more irreverent and more outrageous than before. The cameos at the end are truly worth while. The few in the beginning are forgettable. The actors conviction. I cannot fault any of the actors for not putting in their best, assuming the material to work with was fairly weak to begin with, I found the actors conviction to the characters totally playful. \n\nSo what went wrong with this second installation? Quite honestly, it was the shift away from a parody of the fashion industry, moving towards a Wayans' brothers spoof of a spy film with a dash of espionage. And like any Wayans brother movie one can expect cheap visual gags to fill up free space - there's some really great lines in the film though (really great). Who thought that Zoolander 2 should shoot for the stars at 1h45m? The original barely hit 1h30m, that film had all that set-up and introduction to the world of Zoolander. Part Deux could have dived right in but instead played splish-splash with some really juvenile humour. \n\nYes, Zoolander is an idiot. He's an annoying character. A total self involved tool. But they save him from being despised by allowing the audience to laugh at him. Allowing us to point our fingers at his ridiculous face and laugh till the tears run. But that playground fun time is now over, forced to laugh with him. There's very few sidebar comments that grab our attention and remind us, 'Oh, Zoolander is a douche', not just an idiot.\n\nOther than that Zoolander 2 is a totally run-of-the-mill comedy, nothing too special or outrages, nothing too memorable our outstanding.

Caruso, and everyman leading star Shia LaBeouf. These guys took us by storm with the pleasant surprise Disturbia last year, and pretty much anything with the name Spielberg on it has to be at least entertaining, if not excellent. That's what Eagle Eye is.\n\nFirst off, I cannot stress this enough: don't take this movie seriously. Please don't get mad because the movie isn't realistic. I know it's unrealistic. You know it. Shia LaBeouf knows it. That doesn't stop Eagle Eye from being one of the most entertaining and effective thrillers of recent memory. Is it as smart or as gripping as other chase and mystery thrillers such as the Bourne series? Of course not. However, whenever Eagle Eye stretches our minds to the breaking limits with the insanity on screen, it manages to throw in a mind boggling action sequence or two right as we start to get mad.\n\nThe film, very well masked by trailers that really only show the beginning of the film and small pieces of the end, deals with cyber-terrorism and a secret military project dealing with destruction and national security. The US Secretary of Defense is portrayed (Michael Chiklis), it's incredibly unrealistic, has Shia LaBeouf, and has a prominent military character (Anthony Mackie). I can already here the Transformers comparisons flying in. The film also lacks in the originality department elsewhere, as elements of I, Robot and Live Free or Die Hard are also present and quite obvious.\n\nI cannot give enough accolades to whoever thought up this action - Eagle Eye boasts arguably the best action sequences of the year. The CGI is seamless and more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. With car chases to rival the best of them, as well as one of the most clever "on-foot" chases I've ever seen within an airport, Eagle Eye never fails to grab your attention with the incredible action sequences.\n\nNow to our cast, the headliners of which are two of film's biggest rising stars. Both live up to their names and reputations admirably. Shia LaBeouf revisits the "troubled youth" character he created in Disturbia, though his turn here is darker and has more depth. He really stretches some acting muscle in the beginning of the film, and it is because of this early success that we are willing to go along for the ride with him, following, trusting, and believing in his Jerry Shaw. Michelle Monaghan, long one of the most underrated in the business, also helps us believe in her character with a convincing show of emotion early in the film. The whole film, despite the action sequences, rides on the shoulders of the leads. If the audience doesn't like them, the film will ultimately fail. I'm pleased to tell you that they rise to the occasion and carry the film with ease.\n\nOur supporting cast includes veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. Maybe it was the script, but Thornton's character was so stereotypical and overdone that it almost made him laughable - especially towards the end. Chiklis did great in his role as the Secretary of Defense - and the unfortunate "victim" of circumstance. Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie are acceptable in even smaller roles.\n\nI remember when I watched my first D.J. Caruso film a few years ago (Two For the Money), and I remember how much I hated that film. However, Caruso has certainly grown as a filmmaker and has found his niche in the hugely entertaining action blockbuster genre, even if a lot of "movie borrowing" is done. This will be his breakthrough that will allow him a little more freedom as a filmmaker and possibly allow him to blossom into more than just an action film director. The touches of Spielberg are obvious, as the legendary director/producer's presence is only a plus.\n\nEagle Eye, in short, is a summer blockbuster released in September. It feels like a summer film, and has the components of a summer film: explosions, terrorism, and Shia LaBeouf. It is everything you want in an entertaining action thriller. Don't go looking for your super realistic epic here - Eagle Eye prides itself on blowing your mind every way possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-12-17","keywords":"audio surveillance,geopolitical,regime change,school bus,museum","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eagle Eye: Theatrical Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3270115609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Eagle Eye, directed by D.J.

Michelle Monaghan, long one of the most underrated in the business, also helps us believe in her character with a convincing show of emotion early in the film. The whole film, despite the action sequences, rides on the shoulders of the leads. If the audience doesn't like them, the film will ultimately fail. I'm pleased to tell you that they rise to the occasion and carry the film with ease.\n\nOur supporting cast includes veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. Maybe it was the script, but Thornton's character was so stereotypical and overdone that it almost made him laughable - especially towards the end. Chiklis did great in his role as the Secretary of Defense - and the unfortunate "victim" of circumstance. Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie are acceptable in even smaller roles.\n\nI remember when I watched my first D.J. Caruso film a few years ago (Two For the Money), and I remember how much I hated that film. However, Caruso has certainly grown as a filmmaker and has found his niche in the hugely entertaining action blockbuster genre, even if a lot of "movie borrowing" is done. This will be his breakthrough that will allow him a little more freedom as a filmmaker and possibly allow him to blossom into more than just an action film director. The touches of Spielberg are obvious, as the legendary director/producer's presence is only a plus.\n\nEagle Eye, in short, is a summer blockbuster released in September. It feels like a summer film, and has the components of a summer film: explosions, terrorism, and Shia LaBeouf. It is everything you want in an entertaining action thriller. Don't go looking for your super realistic epic here - Eagle Eye prides itself on blowing your mind every way possible.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-12-17","keywords":"audio surveillance,geopolitical,regime change,school bus,museum","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eagle Eye: Theatrical Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3270115609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Eagle Eye, directed by D.J.

If you have not, enjoy it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92060,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-03-26","keywords":"gryphon,competition,boy,dancing,father figure","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Spiderwick Chronicles","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498204953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Spiderwick Chronicles Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092961/","name":"Sarah Bolger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914132/","name":"Mark Waters"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456732/","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1183854/","name":"David Berenbaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000626/","name":"John Sayles"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like "the only law is gravity" and "everyone dies, it's just a matter of how", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi.

Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like "the only law is gravity" and "everyone dies, it's just a matter of how", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis.

The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the 'value' of war, of its worth. It's pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?\n\nPro or con?\n\nWhat is interesting is that since the Second World War, this underlying message that is found in nearly all war pictures has slowly changed from the former to the latter. This again is generally shaped in two ways. Either we see the play-by-play results following the issuance of what appears to be a bizarre and foolhardy set of orders from high command (i.e., APOCALYPSE NOW or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). Or we get a glimpse of being right in the action as it all falls apart: hearing the bullets whizzing past our noses, reeling from the impact of RPG's and gazing blankly as the bodies begin to mount (PLATOON, say). BLACK HAWK DOWN, directed by Ridley Scott and accurately following the true story of the best-selling book by Mark Bowden, very much adopts the latter perspective.\n\nOn October 3, 1993, a small unit of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were dropped by helicopter into hostile territory in Mogadishu, Somalia, with what is perceived to be a straightforward mission: the capture of two lieutenants of the Somali warlord, General Aidid. The unit is under command from Major William Garrison (Sam Shepard), and headed by Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) in his first direct experience of frontline leadership. He also has a personal goal - to ensure everyone comes back alive.\n\nYet, these things are never as easy as they appear - hence the development of the book and the film - and when 18-year old frontline rookie Todd Blackbird is injured early on, the entire mission begins to fall apart. More U.S. troops are injured, and when Somalis down two Black Hawk helicopters, the mission changes completely: it's now a rescue operation.\n\nAnd for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see. Remember the Omaha Beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? That was about half an hour long. Think of something three times that length, yet more 'realistic' and with (thankfully) no flag-waving. That is the gist of BLACK HAWK DOWN.\n\nUltimately, one hundred-and-twenty-three U.S. troops were involved in the Mogadishu conflict. Nineteen were killed, and one thousand Somalis also perished.\n\nUnlike RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN doesn't build up a core group of characters, focusing on their emotional makeup and depth. No. Instead, we barely know our 'heroes', with very little time devoted to each characters motivation or purpose. And this is a good thing. At first, you find yourself a little bewildered by the sizeable cast, and this isn't helped by the many distant POV scenes that found this reviewer wondering just who he was seeing living and dying. But surely that is an important and crucial element of war - you're involved in these suicidal missions with men you barely know. You don't have time to share your life-stories. You may have only met that week, that day, or within the last hour. And then it's full on.\n\nWe get snippets of character data: Eversmann's entire focus is on not letting the team down; Specialist Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), for so long tied to his desk simply because he excelled at typing; and Delta Sergeant 'Hoot' Hooten (Tom Sizemore, soon to be playing Bruce Banner in THE HULK), wise despite his years, somehow making more sense of the nonsense than anyone else.\n\nBut any characterisation is underplayed and to the point, which is how it should be. The fresh-facedness and naivety of the troops is key to the success of the film, and of the emotional impact therein. As the errors and bodies mount, we get to see the horror of the conflict - the carnage and devastation, relentlessness and never-ending waves of Somali forces - directly through the eyes of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force squad. I was somewhat stunned by the impact of the movie, both in the way the action grips you and shakes you violently until you want to let go, and in the occasional and very touching soft moments. Indeed, the action is so intense that I found myself at times glazing over, thinking of something else, and with hindsight I put this down to some kind of need for an emotional release; certainly, I cannot fault the film in that sense. It was simply a case of 'too much.'\n\nThroughout the movie both the acting and direction are superb; Ridley Scott has an eye for detail and filmography that is probably unmatched. Even his lesser efforts like HANNIBAL are beautifully shot. And BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of his best efforts to date.\n\nThe musical score is also superb, and I was encouraged to hear the Stone Temple Pilot's CREEP near the beginning of the flick. I believe this is the first time I have heard a STP song in any movie.\n\nWhat is also very welcome is the lack of U.S. nationalism in this picture. Of America saving the day. Unlike, say, brother Tony Scott's TOP GUN - which yes, was making a different point entirely (i.e., let's make some money and recruit some boys to the Navy at the same time) - this isn't about the might of the U.S. There is no wake-leaving in BLACK HAWK DOWN. Real people made mistakes, and real people died.\n\nSpeaking of Tony Scott, however, my only minor quibble was Sam Shepard's performance. He was probably in the wrong movie, as all his mannerisms (especially the way he took off his sunglasses in that quick-draw kind of way that stereotypical military types always seem to do) appeared to me to come straight out of TOP GUN. He was a little too 'bleh' for my tastes. For all I know William Garrison could have been exactly like that, but it still seemed a little Hollywood.\n\nI also wasn't completely comfortable as to how the Somalis were portrayed; this movie wasn't really about good versus bad in my opinion, but on the face of it the U.S. are the bad guys here. At least inasmuch as they were at fault. Comparisons are made with Vietnam both in the unnecessary involvement of the U.S. in the Somali civil war, and in the end credits of the film where we learn that the Medal of Honour was awarded to two U.S. soldiers for the first time since the Vietnam conflict. Yet, throughout the film the Somali are seen in only two ways - either a relentless force of bloodthirsty killers, or a simple people trying to stay out of the way. Now yes, this may be what it really was like - I cannot say because I wasn't there - but the overall message didn't fit well with me. They seemed too one-dimensional, a bit TOO bloodthirsty, and that left a bitter taste.\n\nAlso as mentioned above the film is often confusing during the extended battle scene, and warrants more than one view. As the blood and dirt begins to pile, you will find yourself wondering who you are looking at, particularly when the perspective is on several soldiers from a distance. But that can be forgiven. This isn't PREDATOR, and while that film is outstanding as a piece of science fiction, it made a great effort to separate the marines so that the viewer would have an easy time following each one.\n\nThat, of course, isn't real life, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is, perhaps, as close as we've come yet to an accurate capture of the true feel of war.\n\nRating: **** 1/2 (out of five)"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":376688,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. soldier,u.s. army,gunfight,street shootout","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the 'value' of war, of its worth. It's pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?\n\nPro or con?\n\nWhat is interesting is that since the Second World War, this underlying message that is found in nearly all war pictures has slowly changed from the former to the latter. This again is generally shaped in two ways. Either we see the play-by-play results following the issuance of what appears to be a bizarre and foolhardy set of orders from high command (i.e., APOCALYPSE NOW or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). Or we get a glimpse of being right in the action as it all falls apart: hearing the bullets whizzing past our noses, reeling from the impact of RPG's and gazing blankly as the bodies begin to mount (PLATOON, say). BLACK HAWK DOWN, directed by Ridley Scott and accurately following the true story of the best-selling book by Mark Bowden, very much adopts the latter perspective.\n\nOn October 3, 1993, a small unit of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were dropped by helicopter into hostile territory in Mogadishu, Somalia, with what is perceived to be a straightforward mission: the capture of two lieutenants of the Somali warlord, General Aidid. The unit is under command from Major William Garrison (Sam Shepard), and headed by Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) in his first direct experience of frontline leadership. He also has a personal goal - to ensure everyone comes back alive.\n\nYet, these things are never as easy as they appear - hence the development of the book and the film - and when 18-year old frontline rookie Todd Blackbird is injured early on, the entire mission begins to fall apart. More U.S. troops are injured, and when Somalis down two Black Hawk helicopters, the mission changes completely: it's now a rescue operation.\n\nAnd for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see. Remember the Omaha Beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? That was about half an hour long. Think of something three times that length, yet more 'realistic' and with (thankfully) no flag-waving. That is the gist of BLACK HAWK DOWN.\n\nUltimately, one hundred-and-twenty-three U.S. troops were involved in the Mogadishu conflict. Nineteen were killed, and one thousand Somalis also perished.\n\nUnlike RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN doesn't build up a core group of characters, focusing on their emotional makeup and depth. No. Instead, we barely know our 'heroes', with very little time devoted to each characters motivation or purpose. And this is a good thing. At first, you find yourself a little bewildered by the sizeable cast, and this isn't helped by the many distant POV scenes that found this reviewer wondering just who he was seeing living and dying. But surely that is an important and crucial element of war - you're involved in these suicidal missions with men you barely know. You don't have time to share your life-stories. You may have only met that week, that day, or within the last hour. And then it's full on.\n\nWe get snippets of character data: Eversmann's entire focus is on not letting the team down; Specialist Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), for so long tied to his desk simply because he excelled at typing; and Delta Sergeant 'Hoot' Hooten (Tom Sizemore, soon to be playing Bruce Banner in THE HULK), wise despite his years, somehow making more sense of the nonsense than anyone else.\n\nBut any characterisation is underplayed and to the point, which is how it should be. The fresh-facedness and naivety of the troops is key to the success of the film, and of the emotional impact therein. As the errors and bodies mount, we get to see the horror of the conflict - the carnage and devastation, relentlessness and never-ending waves of Somali forces - directly through the eyes of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force squad. I was somewhat stunned by the impact of the movie, both in the way the action grips you and shakes you violently until you want to let go, and in the occasional and very touching soft moments. Indeed, the action is so intense that I found myself at times glazing over, thinking of something else, and with hindsight I put this down to some kind of need for an emotional release; certainly, I cannot fault the film in that sense. It was simply a case of 'too much.'\n\nThroughout the movie both the acting and direction are superb; Ridley Scott has an eye for detail and filmography that is probably unmatched. Even his lesser efforts like HANNIBAL are beautifully shot. And BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of his best efforts to date.\n\nThe musical score is also superb, and I was encouraged to hear the Stone Temple Pilot's CREEP near the beginning of the flick. I believe this is the first time I have heard a STP song in any movie.\n\nWhat is also very welcome is the lack of U.S. nationalism in this picture. Of America saving the day. Unlike, say, brother Tony Scott's TOP GUN - which yes, was making a different point entirely (i.e., let's make some money and recruit some boys to the Navy at the same time) - this isn't about the might of the U.S. There is no wake-leaving in BLACK HAWK DOWN. Real people made mistakes, and real people died.\n\nSpeaking of Tony Scott, however, my only minor quibble was Sam Shepard's performance. He was probably in the wrong movie, as all his mannerisms (especially the way he took off his sunglasses in that quick-draw kind of way that stereotypical military types always seem to do) appeared to me to come straight out of TOP GUN. He was a little too 'bleh' for my tastes. For all I know William Garrison could have been exactly like that, but it still seemed a little Hollywood.\n\nI also wasn't completely comfortable as to how the Somalis were portrayed; this movie wasn't really about good versus bad in my opinion, but on the face of it the U.S. are the bad guys here. At least inasmuch as they were at fault. Comparisons are made with Vietnam both in the unnecessary involvement of the U.S. in the Somali civil war, and in the end credits of the film where we learn that the Medal of Honour was awarded to two U.S. soldiers for the first time since the Vietnam conflict. Yet, throughout the film the Somali are seen in only two ways - either a relentless force of bloodthirsty killers, or a simple people trying to stay out of the way. Now yes, this may be what it really was like - I cannot say because I wasn't there - but the overall message didn't fit well with me. They seemed too one-dimensional, a bit TOO bloodthirsty, and that left a bitter taste.\n\nAlso as mentioned above the film is often confusing during the extended battle scene, and warrants more than one view. As the blood and dirt begins to pile, you will find yourself wondering who you are looking at, particularly when the perspective is on several soldiers from a distance. But that can be forgiven. This isn't PREDATOR, and while that film is outstanding as a piece of science fiction, it made a great effort to separate the marines so that the viewer would have an easy time following each one.\n\nThat, of course, isn't real life, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is, perhaps, as close as we've come yet to an accurate capture of the true feel of war.\n\nRating: **** 1/2 (out of five)","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":376688,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. soldier,u.s. army,gunfight,street shootout","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But as the events unfold, the mental evolution of the main character becomes analogous with the craft's journey both in space and fate.\n\nThere's a hint of third level on the movie which probably means I have to watch this movie again. It's not just the craft or the man inside who's making the journey but us, as human beings collectively.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-06-16","keywords":"accident,low budget sci fi movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Push","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735054105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A science fiction art film about an adventurous mission to Jupiter's moon that is cut short when disaster strikes, killing the co-pilot.

Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.\n\nThe characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.\n\nThe special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.\n\nAs I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.\n\nThe overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.\n\nIt's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502014,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"post apocalypse,drone,cabin in the woods,black and white scene,alien invasion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498116121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A court martial sends a veteran soldier to a distant planet, where he has to destroy the remains of an alien race.

It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it. But of course it came too late and now the show has been cancelled after it just started to find its footing.\n\nContrary to some other comments I've seen, Enterprise did NOT use its cast to its fullest potential. Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something. Reed was just starting to get some good stuff this season. Enterprise had a wonderful opportunity to connect every Trek series together and revitalize the franchise but all it did (and most people believe this) was bury it. Despite Enterprise's accomplishments, its failures reign supreme. As much as I love Trek, it needs a rest. Maybe after a few years it will be brought back by people who have new ideas to bring to it. Then, hopefully, we will truly go where no one has gone before."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"earth starship,earthling,terran,space explorer,earthman","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000836/","name":"Scott Bakula"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082517/","name":"John Billingsley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086883/","name":"Jolene Blalock"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094909/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053559/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103804/","name":"Brannon Braga"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Blu-Ray Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2275393049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.\n\nThe characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.\n\nThe special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.\n\nAs I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.\n\nThe overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.\n\nIt's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502014,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"post apocalypse,drone,cabin in the woods,black and white scene,alien invasion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498116121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A court martial sends a veteran soldier to a distant planet, where he has to destroy the remains of an alien race.

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film.

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI. \n\nConclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone.

Die ersten Befunde zeigen eindeutig, dass die Todesursache Strangulation gewesen sein muss. Doch Detective Dover und Asha finden keinerlei Hinweise auf Einwirkung von außen. Es scheint, als wäre Creighton ermordet worden, ohne vom Täter auch nur berührt worden zu sein. Syfy zeigt alle 10 Episoden von Halcyon in der Spielfilmfassung.</desc>

The first episode sets the stage for this 18 episode series. After the Russians capture a German spy by the name of Hans Kloss, they spend a great deal of time interrogating him about the smallest details of his life. The German spy is replaced with a Polish look-a-like named Janek (Stanislaw Mikulski), and his "escape" is staged to have several German witnesses that will confirm his identity as a German officer. Hans Kloss provides intelligence and assistance to other spies he is aligned with and, more significantly, creates an environment in which the Germans are all suspecting each other of being a traitor, thus crushing their morale.\n\nHans Kloss gets himself into countless sticky situations, which nearly take a miracle to untangle from. Each episode has mystery and keeps one guessing how it will turn out until the very end. Although there is no major carryover in the storyline between each episode, there are more than a number of small details that find their way into the next installments.\n\nThe entire story takes place from 1943 to 1945, and we see Germany at its height of power to its gradual fall. The part that I found especially interesting are the final days of the war, when the tables were turned and the days of the Germany's power where numbered. The fear they inspired in others is now something they had to deal with themselves. I also found it interesting that it showed some of the German officers were positioning themselves to look favorable with the Americans hoping to find a haven with them (which has been confirmed a number of times with declassified information but isn't widely known).\n\nMore than Life at Stake is a classic Polish television show that has remained popular since its creation in 1967-1968 (and probably will for many years in the future). The episodes are alternately directed by Andrzej Konic or Janusz Morgenstern. Hans Kloss is a cultural icon that is probably just as popular as Czterej pancerni i pies, which was also made in the late 1960s. Furthermore, even though Stawka wieksza niz zycie was made during the period of Soviet occupation of Poland, there is less pro-communist sentiment than Czterej pancerni i pies and even portrays the AK favorably. More than Life at Stake is an exceptional WWII serial, particularly for those who like the espionage side to the story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"1968-10-10","keywords":"nazi,spy,cult,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586725/","name":"Stanislaw Mikulski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439202/","name":"Emil Karewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668037/","name":"Bronislaw Pawlik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098526/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first episode sets the stage for this 18 episode series. After the Russians capture a German spy by the name of Hans Kloss, they spend a great deal of time interrogating him about the smallest details of his life. The German spy is replaced with a Polish look-a-like named Janek (Stanislaw Mikulski), and his "escape" is staged to have several German witnesses that will confirm his identity as a German officer. Hans Kloss provides intelligence and assistance to other spies he is aligned with and, more significantly, creates an environment in which the Germans are all suspecting each other of being a traitor, thus crushing their morale.\n\nHans Kloss gets himself into countless sticky situations, which nearly take a miracle to untangle from. Each episode has mystery and keeps one guessing how it will turn out until the very end. Although there is no major carryover in the storyline between each episode, there are more than a number of small details that find their way into the next installments.\n\nThe entire story takes place from 1943 to 1945, and we see Germany at its height of power to its gradual fall. The part that I found especially interesting are the final days of the war, when the tables were turned and the days of the Germany's power where numbered. The fear they inspired in others is now something they had to deal with themselves. I also found it interesting that it showed some of the German officers were positioning themselves to look favorable with the Americans hoping to find a haven with them (which has been confirmed a number of times with declassified information but isn't widely known).\n\nMore than Life at Stake is a classic Polish television show that has remained popular since its creation in 1967-1968 (and probably will for many years in the future). The episodes are alternately directed by Andrzej Konic or Janusz Morgenstern. Hans Kloss is a cultural icon that is probably just as popular as Czterej pancerni i pies, which was also made in the late 1960s. Furthermore, even though Stawka wieksza niz zycie was made during the period of Soviet occupation of Poland, there is less pro-communist sentiment than Czterej pancerni i pies and even portrays the AK favorably. More than Life at Stake is an exceptional WWII serial, particularly for those who like the espionage side to the story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"1968-10-10","keywords":"nazi,spy,cult,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586725/","name":"Stanislaw Mikulski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439202/","name":"Emil Karewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668037/","name":"Bronislaw Pawlik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098526/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
