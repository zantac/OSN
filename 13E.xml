So Long My Son picks up that chronological baton, and tells a story about family bonds, the meaning of friendship and what constitutes our morals and ethics through the last 30/40 years of Chinese history, from a stilted, materially basic time of 1980 through to the hypermodernity of China in the 2010s.\n\nIn the same way To Live aimed thinly disguised critiques at the Chinese government's policies through showing its impact on ordinary people, So Long My Son fires a number of shots too and it's in fact a little surprising to me some of these have been overlooked by the censors. The most obvious of them is the criticism of the one child policy, but hidden in there too are mentions of the privatisation of state owned industries in the early 90s and the mass redundancies that went with them, as well as criticism of the wealth inequality of modern China that has ensued from the market economy transition of the 80s and 90s.\n\nI'm unsure if this was a problem specific to the release version I saw, though I have seen other reviews saying the plot was hard to follow, but I noticed that the English subtitles was often only translating about 1/5 of the dialogue in Mandarin. As a speaker of both, I followed the plot and characters quite easily, but can absolutely understand why many reviewers and comments have said they found the characters and plots hard to distinguish if the subtitling was a problem. However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3740,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-22","keywords":"china,non linear,nonlinear timeline,hospital,loss of son","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1042071321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4592524/","name":"Jingchun Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3619308/","name":"Mei Yong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5035471/","name":"Xi Qi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0514744/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461717/","name":"Mei Ah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"duration":"PT3H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So Long My Son picks up that chronological baton, and tells a story about family bonds, the meaning of friendship and what constitutes our morals and ethics through the last 30/40 years of Chinese history, from a stilted, materially basic time of 1980 through to the hypermodernity of China in the 2010s.\n\nIn the same way To Live aimed thinly disguised critiques at the Chinese government's policies through showing its impact on ordinary people, So Long My Son fires a number of shots too and it's in fact a little surprising to me some of these have been overlooked by the censors. The most obvious of them is the criticism of the one child policy, but hidden in there too are mentions of the privatisation of state owned industries in the early 90s and the mass redundancies that went with them, as well as criticism of the wealth inequality of modern China that has ensued from the market economy transition of the 80s and 90s.\n\nI'm unsure if this was a problem specific to the release version I saw, though I have seen other reviews saying the plot was hard to follow, but I noticed that the English subtitles was often only translating about 1/5 of the dialogue in Mandarin. As a speaker of both, I followed the plot and characters quite easily, but can absolutely understand why many reviewers and comments have said they found the characters and plots hard to distinguish if the subtitling was a problem. However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3740,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-22","keywords":"china,non linear,nonlinear timeline,hospital,loss of son","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1042071321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4592524/","name":"Jingchun Wang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3619308/","name":"Mei Yong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5035471/","name":"Xi Qi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0514744/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461717/","name":"Mei Ah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"],"duration":"PT3H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Superb Animation","reviewBody":"It's October and it is usually the time for Halloween themed movies. Unfortunately for us, Halloween has been reduced to cheap horrors, or repetitive thrillers that are a bit of a bore. This year has been slightly different, but this reviewer would like the studios to go back in the past and pull some more seasonal themes to entertain us. Well, someone got my vibe, because my last review is on a film that captures the festive fun that Halloween is for the young and young at heart. So sit back my friends and catch my latest review on the animated feature The Book of Life. \n\nI'll start this review with talking about the story. The Book of Life has a fantastic tale that centers on the typical complication of a love triangle between characters Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana), and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Now we know the typical elements involved in this type of plot, but this film deviates from the typical and gives a little more pep around the story. From the start you get the backstory on each character, and the individual struggles they each face. Then they take these qualities and exploit them by bringing in the two masters of the underworld, who make a wager as to who will win the girl. The result of this wager, makes for an interesting romantic tale that is fun, emotional, and more realistic than half the dramas we get these days. However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. \n\nThe story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. \n\nWhat else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered. Countless puns are shouted in ridiculous voices, often followed by a character face planting into an object. What's even better is that the comedy is also diverse and spread out instead of following the typical style of beating a joke to death, the exception being Joaquin's obsession with mustaches. In addition to the comedy, the music also brings some thing to the film. Most of the numbers are covers of famous songs, some done horribly to be funny and others that are very relevant to the plot. A couple of the original numbers made my emotions go on a ride, as happiness, sadness, and even love all came together in the instruments and voice. Now most won't find it as powerful as Frozen, but for this reviewer it was nice having the music around the movie, not the opposite way around. Aside from the singing, the voice acting is incredible, each of the cast capturing the essence of the stereotypical Mexican character. Now there are too many to write about so let me pick my three favorites. First is Christina Applegate, the girl has got sass, spunk, and compassion all at work in her tour guide character. The girls sells the story as she uses the wooden puppets, which are represented in the character design, to craft the tale, keeping the kids in line, and yet showing empathy. Then there was Zoe Saldana who has the feisty Mexican girl zest that shows everyone girls don't need men to save them. Her voice is suave and full of passion, and exactly the buffer needed amidst the rowdy, rough voices of the cast. Finally the Queen of the Dead was my favorite character, and Kate del Castillo does a nice job bringing the character to life with flare, kindness, and the ability to hold her own. \n\nWhat can you take away from my sporadic rambling? The Book of Life is one of the better animated films I've seen in a while. It's Halloween fun, with colorful worlds and characters that balance out the predictable and limited tale. I strongly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, possibly in 3-D. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in quite some time, and I believe most will enjoy the adventure at hand. My scores for this film are: \n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-10-15","keywords":"afterlife,mexico,death character,bullfight,serenade","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi840674329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0526019/","name":"Diego Luna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1509613/","name":"Jorge R.

Superb Animation","reviewBody":"It's October and it is usually the time for Halloween themed movies. Unfortunately for us, Halloween has been reduced to cheap horrors, or repetitive thrillers that are a bit of a bore. This year has been slightly different, but this reviewer would like the studios to go back in the past and pull some more seasonal themes to entertain us. Well, someone got my vibe, because my last review is on a film that captures the festive fun that Halloween is for the young and young at heart. So sit back my friends and catch my latest review on the animated feature The Book of Life. \n\nI'll start this review with talking about the story. The Book of Life has a fantastic tale that centers on the typical complication of a love triangle between characters Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana), and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Now we know the typical elements involved in this type of plot, but this film deviates from the typical and gives a little more pep around the story. From the start you get the backstory on each character, and the individual struggles they each face. Then they take these qualities and exploit them by bringing in the two masters of the underworld, who make a wager as to who will win the girl. The result of this wager, makes for an interesting romantic tale that is fun, emotional, and more realistic than half the dramas we get these days. However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. \n\nThe story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. \n\nWhat else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered.

It's not as exclusively idiotic as in the case of Cormac McCarthy/Ridley Scott's very formidable "The Counselor" (what you should know about that picture is that it's not a plot-driven thriller about trafficking, but an existential drama so gloomy that "Se7en" seems to be offering more hope in comparison   and now look at its poster), but the poster and the plot summary for this one produced by the studio and featured on IMDb are obviously misleading as well (even after the studio did its totally uncalled for re-editing of the material) and create false expectations. Hence – disappointed viewers and the abysmal rating.\n\nSo what else "Exposed" is NOT: \n\n\n* This is not a movie starring Keanu Reeves. In fact, Reeves' character plays a very insignificant role in the developments. But unlike Emily Blunt's virtually 'non-existing' lead in "Sicario" that ultimately ruins that otherwise interesting and well-directed flick, it doesn't ruin anything here, because this movie more or less manages to get through the studio's irrational indeed interference and somehow remains centered around a female protagonist played by Ana de Armas. And Reeves should have been credited in the same way as Mira Sorvino is – "and Keanu Reeves".\n\n\n\n* This movie is not an action thriller either.

It's not as exclusively idiotic as in the case of Cormac McCarthy/Ridley Scott's very formidable "The Counselor" (what you should know about that picture is that it's not a plot-driven thriller about trafficking, but an existential drama so gloomy that "Se7en" seems to be offering more hope in comparison   and now look at its poster), but the poster and the plot summary for this one produced by the studio and featured on IMDb are obviously misleading as well (even after the studio did its totally uncalled for re-editing of the material) and create false expectations. Hence – disappointed viewers and the abysmal rating.\n\nSo what else "Exposed" is NOT: \n\n\n* This is not a movie starring Keanu Reeves. In fact, Reeves' character plays a very insignificant role in the developments. But unlike Emily Blunt's virtually 'non-existing' lead in "Sicario" that ultimately ruins that otherwise interesting and well-directed flick, it doesn't ruin anything here, because this movie more or less manages to get through the studio's irrational indeed interference and somehow remains centered around a female protagonist played by Ana de Armas. And Reeves should have been credited in the same way as Mira Sorvino is – "and Keanu Reeves".\n\n\n\n* This movie is not an action thriller either. Police work and corrupt cops are present but seen from a different angle.\n\n\nWhat is "Exposed" then? Despite all the carnage caused by the studio's decisions, it's still a legit psychological drama with half of its dialogue in Spanish, which structure resembles those another Spanish speaker Borges found fascinating in many Chesterton's stories – we have two explanations: a supernatural one and a realistic one.

However, those who have read the novel will realize just how fast everything goes. \n\nRachel Portman's score is truly beautiful: probably one of her best.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-01-07","keywords":"premarital sex,racism,female nudity,woman dies from abortion,sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Cider House Rules","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1741725209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVmNGIyOTktMTU4OS00YTM1LWE4OTAtMmRmNmYzNmY2YzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVmNGIyOTktMTU4OS00YTM1LWE4OTAtMmRmNmYzNmY2YzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #4","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000234/","name":"Charlize Theron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159642/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410288/","name":"John Irving"],"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="en">Shooting for Socrates</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Shooting for Socrates: Directed by James Erskine. With John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson. In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - "a fee for this and a fee for that") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - "the next George Best". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the "top of the World" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the sociopolitical backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best. With laughter and passion, this is the ultimate story of the beautiful game and what it means." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt3223394/","name":"Shooting for Socrates","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNDIyMzIzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc3MDc5NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again.

Understandable, baseball and american football ones also get lost in translation in Brazil. So, if you like football-soccer, rely less on American critics and fans. You may need an opinion that feels more like home.\n\nI need to say right here, though: if you are not into football, there is little for you here (no need to finish this). Niche film. My rate is adapted to that, it is no masterpiece cinema.\n\nI was happy to find a movie about the Irish campaign in 1986. They faced Brazil (the pinnacle of the film) and I followed every step of Pat Jennings, Bingham, Armstrong &amp; co as a 13-year old. It was great to see again these lads on screen, learn about the dynamics and backstages of the squad - even if it's definitely not at all a documentary.\n\nThe bits about what is happening in Belfast are very satisfying to me. The family characters tell what was going on. They follow the light atmosphere of the movie. It is not about Trouble. It's about football, growing up, learning to be a fan of something (a sport, music, films etc). Dramatic comedy .\n\nThere are few things more interesting than the hunger for winning...by those used to frustration. A movie about Brazil or even Maradona wouldn't be as interesting. And without telling how it ends, I say the film does a good job of showing what Northern Ireland is - in football, at least, I must say.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2015-07-30","keywords":"northern ireland,belfast,brazil,funeral,mexico","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shooting for Socrates","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2448666649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFjMTRkNzAtYmI5Ni00YTIzLWEwMGYtNzlkMDFmMjkyYzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFjMTRkNzAtYmI5Ni00YTIzLWEwMGYtNzlkMDFmMjkyYzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Shooting for Socrates"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384152/","name":"Conleth Hill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0233807/","name":"Richard Dormer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259847/","name":"James Erskine"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226579/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259847/","name":"James Erskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428744/","name":"Marie Jones"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 3223394, Title: Shooting for Socrates, 
 --- Description: Shooting for Socrates: Directed by James Erskine. With John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson. In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - "a fee for this and a fee for that") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - "the next George Best". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the "top of the World" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the sociopolitical backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best. With laughter and passion, this is the ultimate story of the beautiful game and what it means." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt3223394/","name":"Shooting for Socrates","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNDIyMzIzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc3MDc5NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again.

Understandable, baseball and american football ones also get lost in translation in Brazil. So, if you like football-soccer, rely less on American critics and fans. You may need an opinion that feels more like home.\n\nI need to say right here, though: if you are not into football, there is little for you here (no need to finish this). Niche film. My rate is adapted to that, it is no masterpiece cinema.\n\nI was happy to find a movie about the Irish campaign in 1986. They faced Brazil (the pinnacle of the film) and I followed every step of Pat Jennings, Bingham, Armstrong &amp; co as a 13-year old. It was great to see again these lads on screen, learn about the dynamics and backstages of the squad - even if it's definitely not at all a documentary.\n\nThe bits about what is happening in Belfast are very satisfying to me. The family characters tell what was going on. They follow the light atmosphere of the movie. It is not about Trouble. It's about football, growing up, learning to be a fan of something (a sport, music, films etc). Dramatic comedy .\n\nThere are few things more interesting than the hunger for winning...by those used to frustration. A movie about Brazil or even Maradona wouldn't be as interesting. And without telling how it ends, I say the film does a good job of showing what Northern Ireland is - in football, at least, I must say.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2015-07-30","keywords":"northern ireland,belfast,brazil,funeral,mexico","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shooting for Socrates","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2448666649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFjMTRkNzAtYmI5Ni00YTIzLWEwMGYtNzlkMDFmMjkyYzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFjMTRkNzAtYmI5Ni00YTIzLWEwMGYtNzlkMDFmMjkyYzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Shooting for Socrates","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384152/","name":"Conleth Hill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0233807/","name":"Richard Dormer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259847/","name":"James Erskine"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226579/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259847/","name":"James Erskine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428744/","name":"Marie Jones"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Check out the scene in the Laffayette Cemetery...there is a crypt bearing the name "Spencer Hepburn". Nice one.\n\nThe ending is a little rushed and it seems that Miller might have left the set early that day, since he apparently vanishes. It also leaves blatant amounts of room for a sequel, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nThat I even considered seeing this film was primarily due to Wes Craven's participation. However, I found it to be an imaginative and fairly tasteful modernisation of one of the all-time cinematic horror legends.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33193,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2000-12-22","keywords":"van helsing,lucy westenra character,van helsing character,dr jack seward character,first part","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dracula 2000","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3773734425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI0M2EwNzAtZGFlYS00M2EyLWEyYmQtNDA3MjI2NjFmMzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI0M2EwNzAtZGFlYS00M2EyLWEyYmQtNDA3MjI2NjFmMzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905311/","name":"Justine Waddell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001538/","name":"Jonny Lee Miller"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527261/","name":"Patrick Lussier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038165/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009681/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0812373/","name":"Joel Soisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527261/","name":"Patrick Lussier"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I appreciated his color palette of browns and blacks, and like Polanski's `Repulsion' he manages to place you into the heart of a character on a downward spiral while referencing back to the vampire film.

Appropriate because Charlotte (Wynona Ryder), like the nation, is about to shed a little of her innocence and face some difficult realities.  Cher, Ryder and an adorably young Christina Ricci are perfect as a single parent family.  Cher, in her best work ever, including Moonstruck, is a free-spirited mom who only cooks finger food because anything else is too much of a commitment.  Ryder, who narrates the film from her character's perspective, is a high school student who, despite her fervent wish to lead a devout life, falls in love with the local handyman.  Ricci is the youngest, a champion swimmer who steals the whole movie with scenes like her pumpkin scene. (Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's unforgettable.) Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the shoe salesman who falls head over heels for Cher, family and all.\n\nSet in coastal Massachusetts, the scenery is breathtaking, and the idyllic depiction of life in a small town in the last days of American innocence is dead on.

Appropriate because Charlotte (Wynona Ryder), like the nation, is about to shed a little of her innocence and face some difficult realities.  Cher, Ryder and an adorably young Christina Ricci are perfect as a single parent family.  Cher, in her best work ever, including Moonstruck, is a free-spirited mom who only cooks finger food because anything else is too much of a commitment.  Ryder, who narrates the film from her character's perspective, is a high school student who, despite her fervent wish to lead a devout life, falls in love with the local handyman.  Ricci is the youngest, a champion swimmer who steals the whole movie with scenes like her pumpkin scene. (Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's unforgettable.) Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the shoe salesman who falls head over heels for Cher, family and all.\n\nSet in coastal Massachusetts, the scenery is breathtaking, and the idyllic depiction of life in a small town in the last days of American innocence is dead on.  Director Richard Benjamin, who also gave us such charming films as Milk Money and My Stepmother is an Alien, rivals Penny Marshall and Rob Reiner with this gem.\n\nThis film is perfection, an absolute 10.

    <title lang="en">Shooting for Socrates</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Shooting for Socrates: Directed by James Erskine. With John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson. In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - "a fee for this and a fee for that") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - "the next George Best". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the "top of the World" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the sociopolitical backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best.

I love Horror stories with some kind of 'mechanism' (like the similar clocklike thing in 'THE EIGHTEENTH ANGEL') But, sadly, although briefly referred to several times throughout the film, this really didn't play much of a part in the ongoing 'plot' to use the term loosely. I don't know... Bottom line: Excellent idea but rather poor execution. Billie was absolutely gorgeous though; I kind wish SHE was the one to lose a few of her clothes instead of the typical skankie one..., but alas..., no go..\n\nI would say that the director and the script is where the real flaws were; the visuals could easily have been done to FAR better effect and in a MUCH more stylized way. And they coulda built the story FAR better too. It was SORT of slightly reminiscent of 'SKELETON KEY' which also could have EASILY gotten screwed up a million different ways; but in THAT film the atmosphere and moody touches were right on the money. Here, it's kinda like they threw the script and story in a blender and we saw pretty much what came out.\n\nSo, no, with as many other films there are to see, unless like me, you feel that Billie is SO damn gorgeous that you don't mind just sitting there and looking at her the whole time, I'd really recommend you find another film that would be MUCH more entertaining and MUCH better executed...\n\n___________________L@the","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1428,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-12","keywords":"haunted mansion,life for a life,life force,trapped,trapped soul","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spirit Trap","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2139423001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkyODk4MmQtNTAzZi00MTQ4LWI0YmItZGUwMmRkOWUwMjhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkyODk4MmQtNTAzZi00MTQ4LWI0YmItZGUwMmRkOWUwMjhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from First Look Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684877/","name":"Billie Piper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531101/","name":"Luke Mably"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146138/","name":"Emma Catherwood"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1583939/","name":"David Smith"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0105027/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020879/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2238460/","name":"Rohan Candappa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1290765/","name":"Paul Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0642684/","name":"Phil O'Shea"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I love Horror stories with some kind of 'mechanism' (like the similar clocklike thing in 'THE EIGHTEENTH ANGEL') But, sadly, although briefly referred to several times throughout the film, this really didn't play much of a part in the ongoing 'plot' to use the term loosely. I don't know... Bottom line: Excellent idea but rather poor execution. Billie was absolutely gorgeous though; I kind wish SHE was the one to lose a few of her clothes instead of the typical skankie one..., but alas..., no go..\n\nI would say that the director and the script is where the real flaws were; the visuals could easily have been done to FAR better effect and in a MUCH more stylized way. And they coulda built the story FAR better too. It was SORT of slightly reminiscent of 'SKELETON KEY' which also could have EASILY gotten screwed up a million different ways; but in THAT film the atmosphere and moody touches were right on the money. Here, it's kinda like they threw the script and story in a blender and we saw pretty much what came out.\n\nSo, no, with as many other films there are to see, unless like me, you feel that Billie is SO damn gorgeous that you don't mind just sitting there and looking at her the whole time, I'd really recommend you find another film that would be MUCH more entertaining and MUCH better executed...\n\n___________________L@the","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1428,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-12","keywords":"haunted mansion,life for a life,life force,trapped,trapped soul","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spirit Trap","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2139423001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkyODk4MmQtNTAzZi00MTQ4LWI0YmItZGUwMmRkOWUwMjhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkyODk4MmQtNTAzZi00MTQ4LWI0YmItZGUwMmRkOWUwMjhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from First Look Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684877/","name":"Billie Piper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531101/","name":"Luke Mably","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146138/","name":"Emma Catherwood"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1583939/","name":"David Smith"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0105027/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020879/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2238460/","name":"Rohan Candappa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1290765/","name":"Paul Finch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0642684/","name":"Phil O'Shea"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\n\n"Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.\n\nI was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14048,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\n\n"Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.\n\nI was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14048,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

I'm at a loss to know why because I think it's an absolutely charming fantasy, using his own peculiar take on the Peter Pan story and extending it.\n\nRobin Williams as Peter Banning is a hard driving lawyer with a wife and two children Caroline Goodall, Charlie Korsmo and Amber Scott respectively. He was an orphan kid who married the granddaughter of Wendy Darling who was Sir James M. Barrie's inspiration for the Peter Pan tale.\n\nBut it's all real, Robin Williams doesn't know he's Peter Pan who left Never Never Land for reasons you'll discover in the film. But he left one nasty enemy there in Captain Hook and Hook captures his children to lure him back to Never Never Land where Hook can take vengeance upon him.\n\nSpielberg got some great performances out of his cast which also includes Julia Roberts as the elfin Tinkerbell and Maggie Smith as the aged Wendy. But stealing the film completely in one bravura performance is Dustin Hoffman. \n\nCaptain Hook is one of those fabulous roles where the actor can just feast on the scenery and can just go to town with it. It's a role that it is impossible to overact in. I doubt if Dustin Hoffman ever enjoyed himself more in making a film.\n\nHook got five Oscar nominations in the technical categories, but sad to say did not win anything in 1991. I'm surprised that one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator films beat Hook out for Best Visual Effects, this one is clearly superior in that department if anything.\n\nRobin Williams has his innings as well, trying to remember his past as Peter Pan and get back into Pan like behavior to defeat Captain Hook. As to why he left Never Never Land in the first place. Let's just say he took one too many trips outside his domain and something happened to him that happens to all young men at some point.\n\nHook is a great piece of family entertainment from Steven Spielberg and Dustin Hoffman's fans will really enjoy it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":243827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-12-11","keywords":"children,1990s,caught in a net,hero,duel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hook","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi845128729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Hook"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057381/","name":"J.M.

I'm at a loss to know why because I think it's an absolutely charming fantasy, using his own peculiar take on the Peter Pan story and extending it.\n\nRobin Williams as Peter Banning is a hard driving lawyer with a wife and two children Caroline Goodall, Charlie Korsmo and Amber Scott respectively. He was an orphan kid who married the granddaughter of Wendy Darling who was Sir James M. Barrie's inspiration for the Peter Pan tale.\n\nBut it's all real, Robin Williams doesn't know he's Peter Pan who left Never Never Land for reasons you'll discover in the film. But he left one nasty enemy there in Captain Hook and Hook captures his children to lure him back to Never Never Land where Hook can take vengeance upon him.\n\nSpielberg got some great performances out of his cast which also includes Julia Roberts as the elfin Tinkerbell and Maggie Smith as the aged Wendy. But stealing the film completely in one bravura performance is Dustin Hoffman. \n\nCaptain Hook is one of those fabulous roles where the actor can just feast on the scenery and can just go to town with it. It's a role that it is impossible to overact in. I doubt if Dustin Hoffman ever enjoyed himself more in making a film.\n\nHook got five Oscar nominations in the technical categories, but sad to say did not win anything in 1991. I'm surprised that one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator films beat Hook out for Best Visual Effects, this one is clearly superior in that department if anything.\n\nRobin Williams has his innings as well, trying to remember his past as Peter Pan and get back into Pan like behavior to defeat Captain Hook. As to why he left Never Never Land in the first place. Let's just say he took one too many trips outside his domain and something happened to him that happens to all young men at some point.\n\nHook is a great piece of family entertainment from Steven Spielberg and Dustin Hoffman's fans will really enjoy it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":243827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-12-11","keywords":"children,1990s,caught in a net,hero,duel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hook","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi845128729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Hook","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057381/","name":"J.M.

This movie was fun, well crafted and extremely entertaining. Being a big fan of the franchise (and of the genre)I was very happy with how this prequel explored the backstory of the psychic/medium and her future "helpers". The effects were great, the different ghosts/spirits/ entities were all different in their background and aspects. The plot was well developed and the jump-scares were well placed. There is no "repetition" from the previous two movies so this movie gained in originality.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n\nVery fun ride!\n\nNB: look for two thrilling cameos!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"attic,house,evil spirit,astral projection,supernatural power","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4241469209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1MTAxNjU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU5NDAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1MTAxNjU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU5NDAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This prequel, set before the haunting of the Lambert family, reveals how gifted psychic Elise Rainier reluctantly agrees to use her ability to contact the dead in order to help a teenage girl who has been targeted by a dangerous supernatural entity.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000551/","name":"Dermot Mulroney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2640887/","name":"Stefanie Scott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0760151/","name":"Angus Sampson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018555/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm at a loss to know why because I think it's an absolutely charming fantasy, using his own peculiar take on the Peter Pan story and extending it.\n\nRobin Williams as Peter Banning is a hard driving lawyer with a wife and two children Caroline Goodall, Charlie Korsmo and Amber Scott respectively. He was an orphan kid who married the granddaughter of Wendy Darling who was Sir James M. Barrie's inspiration for the Peter Pan tale.\n\nBut it's all real, Robin Williams doesn't know he's Peter Pan who left Never Never Land for reasons you'll discover in the film. But he left one nasty enemy there in Captain Hook and Hook captures his children to lure him back to Never Never Land where Hook can take vengeance upon him.\n\nSpielberg got some great performances out of his cast which also includes Julia Roberts as the elfin Tinkerbell and Maggie Smith as the aged Wendy. But stealing the film completely in one bravura performance is Dustin Hoffman. \n\nCaptain Hook is one of those fabulous roles where the actor can just feast on the scenery and can just go to town with it. It's a role that it is impossible to overact in. I doubt if Dustin Hoffman ever enjoyed himself more in making a film.\n\nHook got five Oscar nominations in the technical categories, but sad to say did not win anything in 1991. I'm surprised that one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator films beat Hook out for Best Visual Effects, this one is clearly superior in that department if anything.\n\nRobin Williams has his innings as well, trying to remember his past as Peter Pan and get back into Pan like behavior to defeat Captain Hook. As to why he left Never Never Land in the first place. Let's just say he took one too many trips outside his domain and something happened to him that happens to all young men at some point.\n\nHook is a great piece of family entertainment from Steven Spielberg and Dustin Hoffman's fans will really enjoy it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":243827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-12-11","keywords":"children,1990s,caught in a net,hero,duel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hook","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi845128729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Hook"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057381/","name":"J.M.

I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!\n\nAs a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.\n\nThe movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.\n\nOne small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.

I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!\n\nAs a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.\n\nThe movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.\n\nOne small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.  I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me (like Aliens) but it's a very good single viewing action picture.  Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game. Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10, if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie.

With Samuel's help, Sophie comes up with a fundraising plan to host a "knit-off" and auction at the local makers market.

 --- Description: A Love Yarn: Directed by Peter Burger. With Anna Hutchison, Simon Arblaster, Olivia Tennet, Annie Whittle. The owner of a quaint New Zealand yarn shop, Sophie Markham, gets her world flipped upside down after learning her top supplier of yarn, King Farms, is stopping production. Much to her surprise, the charming yet stuck-in-his-ways Samuel King has traveled all the way from New York to audit the business model of the farm. Desperate to keep her shop going, Sophie convinces Samuel to give her two weeks to learn the ropes of yarn spinning and raise enough money to buy the mill herself. With Samuel's help, Sophie comes up with a fundraising plan to host a "knit-off" and auction at the local makers market. However, when the two weeks come to an end Sophie finds herself at a crossroads of business and romance.

His battle with Diffuse Lewy body disease which is incurable, how it impacted him. The story is narrated by his wife Susan Schneider, close friends, and neuroscientist. The saddest part is, Robin never knew his enemy, what is he suffering from. Neither his doctors had any idea until 2016 by then it was two years since robin left the world.\n\n Review: Robin Williams is widely creative, undoubtedly the greatest improvisational actor can fit into any role, no one can keep up with his humour, more than all he has been generous, a loving human always spreads happiness unconditionally. This film recalls the life and legacy of Robin from friends, neighbors, colleagues, and his wife, Susan Schneider. As we all know by now, Robin didn't commit suicide because he is depressed or addiction problems. He was suffering from rare Lewy body dementia (LBD). LBD Is a case of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.\n\n The movie primarily focuses on the final days of the robin, his struggles, and more importantly, his strength.

The movie also features some scenes of Robin Williams from documentaries and talk shows. Where we see highlights his major roles and how he brings laughter to people around them and his philosophies of life. This documentary also raises awareness about LBD.

Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.\n\nWe Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

It has at least two different meanings but what is amazing that something like that actually happened to the director's father.\n\nIf you like to see an uplifting, sometimes funny, sad and quirky movie and at the same time learn about the Einstein relativity theory (the scene on the bridge) you will not be disappointed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":895,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-10-24","keywords":"farm,ex teacher,rural setting,unemployment,isolation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1437136/","name":"Olga Prószynska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435653/","name":"Rafal Guzniczak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109608/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109606/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.\n\nWe Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

I have not read the novel (even though I plan to do it now) so I'm only offering my views on the movie.\n\nFirst of all: It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. \n\nRobert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me, since I didn't really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or "Remember Me". He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in, and even though I love Emile Hirsch (who auditioned for Jacob too) I'm confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role, it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.\n\nReese Witherspoon was okay. She looked beautiful, was charming and cute but it felt like something was missing - however, I can't think of any other actress I would have liked better in the role, so I came to the conclusion that it was probably the character Marlena that was a little bland, not Reese. \n\nBut the true star of this movie was Christoph Waltz. I may be a bit biased since I loved him in "Inglorious Basterds", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars.

Sometimes it was slapstick, than drama, than comedy, than a romantic movie... What bothered me about this movie as well, is the use of so many stereotypes. Men are pigs when it comes to having children, babies are miracles, a man acts and reacts like a child... \n\nAll in all this is just a poor girl movie that confirms many of their ideas about men and children.

I agree that the movie had funny parts (for instance the praying mantis part was absolutely brilliant), but it never seemed to stick to a certain genre. Sometimes it was slapstick, than drama, than comedy, than a romantic movie... What bothered me about this movie as well, is the use of so many stereotypes. Men are pigs when it comes to having children, babies are miracles, a man acts and reacts like a child... \n\nAll in all this is just a poor girl movie that confirms many of their ideas about men and children. It has some decent, but far from excellent acting in it, but doesn't know where it wants to go. I give it a 5/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36215,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-07-12","keywords":"time for title,bad dream,close up of eyes,close up of lips,close up of mouth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nine Months","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2812084505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0105317/","name":"Patrick Braoudé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Many of us vividly recall the days when the most important thing you had to do that afternoon was find a place to stay cool or to make sure that all of your friends were willing to go on whatever adventure you wanted to embark on.  For me, those days were the years between 1980 and 1987.  At this time I was between the ages of 8 and 15.  This was a time when some of the greatest movies were ever made for a teenaged boy.  The genesis of film was started in my life with films like First Blood, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Back To The Future and of course E.T.\n\n Being that movies were such an intricate part of my young life and these experiences shaped me into the man that I am today, it is easy to recall with reverence the entire experience that went with those films.  E.T. is a rare film however, because it is an experience that just gets better with age.\n\nThere was a theater in Windsor Ontario, where I spent my youth called the Vanity, located on Oullette Street, right near Wyandotte.  This one theater was the place to be when the blockbsuters arrived.  It was a one celled theater that managed to flourish in a time which pre-dated multi plexes with arcades and Pizza Hut's.\n\nWhen the sequel to Star Wars arrived, the Vanity proudly played it.  Same with Raiders and it's sequels and of course E.T.  E.T. was a film that me and my best friend Gary had to see because it was Spielberg.  Even though we were ten years old, we knew that Spielberg had given us great films like Jaws, Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not sure if it is normal at the age of ten but we rushed out to see E.T. because we knew who directed it.  What a phenom this tiny film turned out to be and what a life changing experience the whole film was.\n\nWhen you are ten and you see a movie with your best friend who watches the A-Team and Conan the Barbarian with you, you expect a certain reaction from him.  After all, this same friend enjoys playing football at lunch and enjoys inflicting pain in a barbaric pasttime called the "The Tripping Game", therefore you don't expect a film to affect you and your macho friend the way E.T. did.  When you are ten, you go to the movies to see things like lightsabre duels and heroes with bullwhips being lowered into the Well of the Souls and maybe the occasional breast shot.  What you don't expect is a film to manipulate your emotional realm thh way E.T. did and still does. Most of my friends who saw E.T. bawled their eyes out at the age of ten. I, for some unexplainable reason did not.  I loved the film but it wouldn't be for another six years that I cried in my first film.  That was She's Having A Baby when Kate Bush sang Woman's Work and made me sob uncontrollably as I watched Kevin Bacon lose his unborn child.  Some things can't be explained.\n\nE.T. became one of my favourite films and I saw it again on its re-release in 1985, bought the poster, purchased the movie on VHS and told everyone who would listen that E.T. got robbed at the 82 Oscars when it lost every major category to (snicker snicker) Gandhi.  There have been some Oscar travesties but this ( along with Annie Hall defeating Star Wars and Cuckoo's Nest beating Jaws ) had to be up there as one of the most ridiculous snubs ever. I was peeved.  What a joke.  But all of the cranky and derelict academy members seethed with contempt and jealousy because they couldn't accept the fact that a man this young could really be this much of a genius.  In fact he made the rest of the folks in Hollywood look young compared to himself.\n\nAs the years passed I became a film lover, a movie buff and I tried to see any and every film out there.  And I did.  It's not that E.T. became an after-thought, it's just that it became one of those films that just sat it my collection and wasn't utilized often enough.  When I made my revised top 25 list, E.T. would always hover around number 20.  That is not an indictment of the quality of E.T., it's just that my tastes became more garnered to horror films and the sheer brilliance of E.T. was stored in the catacombs of my mind.  That all changed on March 24th, 2002.  This is ironic because my wife and I had the whole day planned.  We were going to see E.T. at the theater and then come home and watch the 24 hour Oscar-a-thon.  And in a year when an inferior film like A Beautiful Mind takes top honours from the much more ambitious and deserving Lord of the Rings, it reminded me of 20 years ago.  I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nSeeing E.T. after a 17 year hiatus was nothing short of uplifting.  My excitement was gushing and when John Williams' ever recognizable score reverberated over the sound system, I was hooked and it felt like I was ten all over again.  I also noticed that the audience was an eclectic mix of young kids, 30 somethings like myself and the elderly.  All of us were there because we either wanted to experience it for the first time or because we wanted to feel what it was like that first time we saw it 20 years ago.\n\nI think I liked E.T. when I was ten but this time around I developed a deep level of respect for it.  E.T. is simply one of the finest films ever made and if you have not seen the film in the theater then you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything about this film is perfect, and there really aren't many films around I can say that about.  Even some of my personal favourites have moments of weakness but not E.T.  There has never really been another movie that has offered the experience that E.T. does.  And when I said that I didn't shed a tear while watching E.T., that has all changed. I think there were about five moments in E.T. that had me holding back the tears.  You can analyze the film, psychologically deconstruct it and tell me that the reason the film works so well is because of the feeling of loneliness and comradery and I will agree with you.  But I don't really care about that.  What it comes down to is that E.T. is a film that will touch you in a way that no other film before could do and no other film after it can.  1982 was a different time for film and it was a different time as a civilization.  And E.T. encompassed all of that.  If I had to make my revised top 25 list, E.T. would be number 2, right behind Jaws and ahead of JFK, Halloween, American Beauty and Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nIf you have not seen E.T. at the theaters since 1985, please I urge you, go see it again.  It is a film experience that is indefeasible.  It is also a film that should be looked upon as a paradigm for which all movies should try to emulate.  There is a reason that films like E.T. and Star Wars and Raiders make the money they do.  And there is also a reason they stay firmly planted in our memories.  That is because they mean something and they stand for something.  Those are the qualities in film that transcend time and they transcend the generations.\n\n10 out of 10----What more can be said?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":388895,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1983-04-25","keywords":"friendly alien,extraterrestrial,empathy,alien,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial: Anniversay Edition [Blu-Ray + Digital Copy]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3090130201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001794/","name":"Henry Thomas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000106/","name":"Drew Barrymore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001075/","name":"Peter Coyote"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558953/","name":"Melissa Mathison"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Many of us vividly recall the days when the most important thing you had to do that afternoon was find a place to stay cool or to make sure that all of your friends were willing to go on whatever adventure you wanted to embark on.  For me, those days were the years between 1980 and 1987.  At this time I was between the ages of 8 and 15.  This was a time when some of the greatest movies were ever made for a teenaged boy.  The genesis of film was started in my life with films like First Blood, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Back To The Future and of course E.T.\n\n Being that movies were such an intricate part of my young life and these experiences shaped me into the man that I am today, it is easy to recall with reverence the entire experience that went with those films.  E.T. is a rare film however, because it is an experience that just gets better with age.\n\nThere was a theater in Windsor Ontario, where I spent my youth called the Vanity, located on Oullette Street, right near Wyandotte.  This one theater was the place to be when the blockbsuters arrived.  It was a one celled theater that managed to flourish in a time which pre-dated multi plexes with arcades and Pizza Hut's.\n\nWhen the sequel to Star Wars arrived, the Vanity proudly played it.  Same with Raiders and it's sequels and of course E.T.  E.T. was a film that me and my best friend Gary had to see because it was Spielberg.  Even though we were ten years old, we knew that Spielberg had given us great films like Jaws, Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not sure if it is normal at the age of ten but we rushed out to see E.T. because we knew who directed it.  What a phenom this tiny film turned out to be and what a life changing experience the whole film was.\n\nWhen you are ten and you see a movie with your best friend who watches the A-Team and Conan the Barbarian with you, you expect a certain reaction from him.  After all, this same friend enjoys playing football at lunch and enjoys inflicting pain in a barbaric pasttime called the "The Tripping Game", therefore you don't expect a film to affect you and your macho friend the way E.T. did.  When you are ten, you go to the movies to see things like lightsabre duels and heroes with bullwhips being lowered into the Well of the Souls and maybe the occasional breast shot.  What you don't expect is a film to manipulate your emotional realm thh way E.T. did and still does. Most of my friends who saw E.T. bawled their eyes out at the age of ten. I, for some unexplainable reason did not.  I loved the film but it wouldn't be for another six years that I cried in my first film.  That was She's Having A Baby when Kate Bush sang Woman's Work and made me sob uncontrollably as I watched Kevin Bacon lose his unborn child.  Some things can't be explained.\n\nE.T. became one of my favourite films and I saw it again on its re-release in 1985, bought the poster, purchased the movie on VHS and told everyone who would listen that E.T. got robbed at the 82 Oscars when it lost every major category to (snicker snicker) Gandhi.  There have been some Oscar travesties but this ( along with Annie Hall defeating Star Wars and Cuckoo's Nest beating Jaws ) had to be up there as one of the most ridiculous snubs ever. I was peeved.  What a joke.  But all of the cranky and derelict academy members seethed with contempt and jealousy because they couldn't accept the fact that a man this young could really be this much of a genius.  In fact he made the rest of the folks in Hollywood look young compared to himself.\n\nAs the years passed I became a film lover, a movie buff and I tried to see any and every film out there.  And I did.  It's not that E.T. became an after-thought, it's just that it became one of those films that just sat it my collection and wasn't utilized often enough.  When I made my revised top 25 list, E.T. would always hover around number 20.  That is not an indictment of the quality of E.T., it's just that my tastes became more garnered to horror films and the sheer brilliance of E.T. was stored in the catacombs of my mind.  That all changed on March 24th, 2002.  This is ironic because my wife and I had the whole day planned.  We were going to see E.T. at the theater and then come home and watch the 24 hour Oscar-a-thon.  And in a year when an inferior film like A Beautiful Mind takes top honours from the much more ambitious and deserving Lord of the Rings, it reminded me of 20 years ago.  I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nSeeing E.T. after a 17 year hiatus was nothing short of uplifting.  My excitement was gushing and when John Williams' ever recognizable score reverberated over the sound system, I was hooked and it felt like I was ten all over again.  I also noticed that the audience was an eclectic mix of young kids, 30 somethings like myself and the elderly.  All of us were there because we either wanted to experience it for the first time or because we wanted to feel what it was like that first time we saw it 20 years ago.\n\nI think I liked E.T. when I was ten but this time around I developed a deep level of respect for it.  E.T. is simply one of the finest films ever made and if you have not seen the film in the theater then you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything about this film is perfect, and there really aren't many films around I can say that about.  Even some of my personal favourites have moments of weakness but not E.T.  There has never really been another movie that has offered the experience that E.T. does.  And when I said that I didn't shed a tear while watching E.T., that has all changed. I think there were about five moments in E.T. that had me holding back the tears.  You can analyze the film, psychologically deconstruct it and tell me that the reason the film works so well is because of the feeling of loneliness and comradery and I will agree with you.  But I don't really care about that.  What it comes down to is that E.T. is a film that will touch you in a way that no other film before could do and no other film after it can.  1982 was a different time for film and it was a different time as a civilization.  And E.T. encompassed all of that.  If I had to make my revised top 25 list, E.T. would be number 2, right behind Jaws and ahead of JFK, Halloween, American Beauty and Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nIf you have not seen E.T. at the theaters since 1985, please I urge you, go see it again.  It is a film experience that is indefeasible.  It is also a film that should be looked upon as a paradigm for which all movies should try to emulate.  There is a reason that films like E.T. and Star Wars and Raiders make the money they do.  And there is also a reason they stay firmly planted in our memories.  That is because they mean something and they stand for something.  Those are the qualities in film that transcend time and they transcend the generations.\n\n10 out of 10----What more can be said?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":388895,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1983-04-25","keywords":"friendly alien,extraterrestrial,empathy,alien,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial: Anniversay Edition [Blu-Ray + Digital Copy]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3090130201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001794/","name":"Henry Thomas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000106/","name":"Drew Barrymore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001075/","name":"Peter Coyote"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558953/","name":"Melissa Mathison"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's not a new thing mind you. It has been done in movies like Ghost (which this happily, at least in Germany, references) to name another "oldie". The thing those movies have in common: you have to suspend your disbelief ... quite a stretch at places to be completely honest.\n\nSo if you don't question almost anything in this and accept the very strange but also completely flawed concept ... there is something to enjoy here. The main actors really try their best to give the movie some gravitas. They kind off achieve that ... but again it all will depend on your mindset. My cynical (better?) half of myself would have quite a lot to say about this ... but again, this was not made for that "audience". So while for some endless love may sound fantastic, others quite literally may feel sick just by the thought of it ... not that this doesn't get dark too - but there's always light at the end of the tunnel .. isn't there?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1024,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-08-14","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Endless","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2424225305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE3NjRhOWEtZjE0OS00ZDJlLWFlZGMtMTRmODZmODk1NThiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE3NjRhOWEtZjE0OS00ZDJlLWFlZGMtMTRmODZmODk1NThiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3381295/","name":"Alexandra Shipp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5640595/","name":"Nicholas Hamilton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5125871/","name":"DeRon Horton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1228976/","name":"Scott Speer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0277910/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0351198/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11126743/","name":"Andre Case"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2610491/","name":"Oneil Sharma"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not a new thing mind you. It has been done in movies like Ghost (which this happily, at least in Germany, references) to name another "oldie". The thing those movies have in common: you have to suspend your disbelief ... quite a stretch at places to be completely honest.\n\nSo if you don't question almost anything in this and accept the very strange but also completely flawed concept ... there is something to enjoy here. The main actors really try their best to give the movie some gravitas. They kind off achieve that ... but again it all will depend on your mindset. My cynical (better?) half of myself would have quite a lot to say about this ... but again, this was not made for that "audience". So while for some endless love may sound fantastic, others quite literally may feel sick just by the thought of it ... not that this doesn't get dark too - but there's always light at the end of the tunnel .. isn't there?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1024,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-08-14","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Endless","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2424225305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE3NjRhOWEtZjE0OS00ZDJlLWFlZGMtMTRmODZmODk1NThiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE3NjRhOWEtZjE0OS00ZDJlLWFlZGMtMTRmODZmODk1NThiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3381295/","name":"Alexandra Shipp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5640595/","name":"Nicholas Hamilton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5125871/","name":"DeRon Horton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1228976/","name":"Scott Speer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0277910/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0351198/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11126743/","name":"Andre Case","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2610491/","name":"Oneil Sharma"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But a few years later, Lorna marries bad-un Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain) and disappears back to Donnie's hillbilly extended family in the wilds of North Dakota, led by the fearsome Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville). Fearing for the child's wellbeing, Margaret drags retired Sheriff George on a dangerous journey to rescue the child.\n\nThere are strong similarities in this story with a sub-plot of the excellent "Ozark", where the psychopathic Darlene Snell (Lisa Emery) is intent on having a child to grow up with on her remote ranch. The sense of tension there is recreated here, exacerbated by the movie's extremely slow (read "glacial") pace in its early stages. It's the same sort of rising dread that I felt with "Nocturnal Animals". This reaches its peak at a tense standoff over lamb chops at the Weboy ranch, but we are probably half-way into the film by then.\n\nThe slow pace however is broken by a couple of extremely violent scenes that earn the movie its UK-15 certificate. One (no spoilers here!) harks back to another Kevin Costner blockbuster where he was a bit luckier! And the finale turns a slightly sleepy tale of "two old folks" into an 'all guns blazing' action western that's highly unexpected. Although you could argue that this is tonally extremely uneven, it works and makes the movie a lot more memorable than it otherwise would be.\n\nThe standout leading performance here is the one from Diane Lane as the mentally tortured Granny pursuing her convictions across the country. Here writer/director Thomas Bezucha gives the character full rein. It's a memorable 'strong female' part, that would have been dominated by the male lead in the writing of films a few years back. Lane delivers a dramatic and rock-solid performance that has Oscar nomination written all over it.\n\nI'm also a big fan of Kevin Costner, not just because he's a solid and reliable actor over many years. I always remember him gamely appearing as "The Postman"/'propeller-guy' in Billy Crystal's hilarious montage opening for the 70th Academy Awards. Anyhow, here he has his meatiest dramatic role in many years, and delivers fully on it. Top job, although I suspect this may not be his year for his elusive Best Actor award.\n\nFinally, rounding out the Oscar hopefuls is the brilliant Lesley Manville as Blanche Weboy. It's a dream of a role for the Brighton-born star, nominated of course for the Best Supporting Actress two years ago for "Phantom Thread". And she is genuinely chilling here, firing on all cylinders like some sort of deranged Bette Davis on speed. She's used sparingly in the movie, but that makes her scenes all the more memorable. Another nomination perhaps? I'd predict so, yes.\n\nI found this to be an uncomfortable watch, since I found myself in a moral quandary with the storyline. It's clear that Margaret is genuinely concerned for the safety of Jimmy (and less so, Lorna). Yet, what she is ultimately prepared to do is consider child abduction, when the law if probably on the side of the other party. Sure, the lifestyle and attitudes of the Weboys are alien to this more traditional "Granny". But although Blanche rules with a Victorian-level of grit, isn't she - at least before any of her more vicious tendencies emerge - entitled to do that? The film firmly roots itself behind the Blackledge's as "the good guys", but the script cleverly has you questioning that at various points,\n\nTwo technical categories in "Let Him Go" are also worthy of note. The cinematography is by Guy Godfree, and the sweeping vistas of Montana and North Dakota (actually Alberta in Canada!) are gloriously delivered. And the music by Michael Giacchino - one of my favourite composers - is cello-heavy and fitting for the sombre storyline. I always assess the quality of a score by whether I annoy the cinema cleaners by sitting until the last of the end credits have rolled, and this is one I did that to.\n\nAs the last movie I see before Christmas, "Let Him Go" is not exactly a feelgood festive offering. It's a well-crafted and thoughtful story, but not one to make you feel good inside, for the reasons outlined above. If you are a movie-lover though, then it's an interesting watch, if only for the fine acting performances on offer.\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out "Bob the Movie Man" on the web.

Indeed there are, but there are a couple of great things about it:\n\n\n* this was a movie based on true events\n* the action scenes are exciting and provide an engaging visual felling\n* there is no sugar coating, the actions depicted on the movie real and truthful\n\n\nIt follows a similar line to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, which I liked a lot too. The storytelling around the lives of each soldier are built differently, but the goal here is not to explore the lives of each of them, but to understand the challenges of fighting a war in a place clearly indefensible. There are no protections against the mountains and everyone knows it, even the viewer as you get the first glimpse of the environment the soldiers were put in.\n\nI recommend this movie and I think you will like it if you also like movie based on true events.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28727,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-07-03","keywords":"taliban,based on true story,battle,afghanistan,sniper","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Outpost","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1209384473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5ZWNjNTMtMTIxMC00NzAzLTg1YjUtZTA1Y2E4OThhZTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5ZWNjNTMtMTIxMC00NzAzLTg1YjUtZTA1Y2E4OThhZTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207222/","name":"Scott Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2655177/","name":"Caleb Landry Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527109/","name":"Rod Lurie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0646497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799957/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0651078/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848496/","name":"Paul Tamasy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2053216/","name":"Eric Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1311488/","name":"Jake Tapper"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it."

Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic.

    <desc lang="pl">A Love Yarn: Directed by Peter Burger. With Anna Hutchison, Simon Arblaster, Olivia Tennet, Annie Whittle. The owner of a quaint New Zealand yarn shop, Sophie Markham, gets her world flipped upside down after learning her top supplier of yarn, King Farms, is stopping production. Much to her surprise, the charming yet stuck-in-his-ways Samuel King has traveled all the way from New York to audit the business model of the farm. Desperate to keep her shop going, Sophie convinces Samuel to give her two weeks to learn the ropes of yarn spinning and raise enough money to buy the mill herself. With Samuel's help, Sophie comes up with a fundraising plan to host a "knit-off" and auction at the local makers market.

His battle with Diffuse Lewy body disease which is incurable, how it impacted him. The story is narrated by his wife Susan Schneider, close friends, and neuroscientist. The saddest part is, Robin never knew his enemy, what is he suffering from. Neither his doctors had any idea until 2016 by then it was two years since robin left the world.\n\n Review: Robin Williams is widely creative, undoubtedly the greatest improvisational actor can fit into any role, no one can keep up with his humour, more than all he has been generous, a loving human always spreads happiness unconditionally. This film recalls the life and legacy of Robin from friends, neighbors, colleagues, and his wife, Susan Schneider. As we all know by now, Robin didn't commit suicide because he is depressed or addiction problems. He was suffering from rare Lewy body dementia (LBD). LBD Is a case of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.\n\n The movie primarily focuses on the final days of the robin, his struggles, and more importantly, his strength. Despite fighting a war inside his brain with an unknown enemy, he still kept a smile on his face. He made the world a better place with his morals, generosity, humour. The movie also features some scenes of Robin Williams from documentaries and talk shows. Where we see highlights his major roles and how he brings laughter to people around them and his philosophies of life. This documentary also raises awareness about LBD. The symptoms and risks are talked by neuroscientists.\n\n Verdict: As a fan of Robin Williams, this movie is nostalgic and also heartbreaking.

It was great to hear some of the details I'd not known, such as Togo being the lead dog that travelled the greatest distance of all the teams that traversed the distance and extreme temperatures to get the serum to Nome. The story is more focused on the people than the dogs, which is a nice change (and I love dogs). A very warm, heartfelt story and it's family friendly - a nice bonus! It's not filmed in the Hollywood glossy style but it tells the story it intends.

It was great to hear some of the details I'd not known, such as Togo being the lead dog that travelled the greatest distance of all the teams that traversed the distance and extreme temperatures to get the serum to Nome. The story is more focused on the people than the dogs, which is a nice change (and I love dogs). A very warm, heartfelt story and it's family friendly - a nice bonus! It's not filmed in the Hollywood glossy style but it tells the story it intends. One less star because some of the story comes across a little disjointed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":520,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-25","keywords":"children","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Great Alaskan Race","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1940700953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJhNDgxZmUtYmI2Ni00MDE0LWI1MzQtMzBkYjFmMTlhZWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJhNDgxZmUtYmI2Ni00MDE0LWI1MzQtMzBkYjFmMTlhZWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696169/","name":"Brian Presley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001852/","name":"Treat Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0500894/","name":"Brad Leland"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696169/","name":"Brian Presley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650220/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696169/","name":"Brian Presley"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.\n\nWe Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

    <desc lang="pl">Brytyjka Diana Spencer żyła w latach 1961-1997. W 1981 roku poślubiła księcia Walii, Karola i tym samym weszła do królewskiej rodziny. W jej życiorysie znajdują się takie wydarzenia jak skandaliczny rozwód czy tragiczna śmierć. Twórcy dokumentu przybliżają sylwetkę kobiety, która stała się księżną Dianą. Przyglądają się także rodzinie, z której się wywodziła. Okazuje się, że losy tej familii również są niezwykle ciekawe.</desc>

The results are both humorous and moving, as Joanna, while using the great writer’s voice, begins to discover her own.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4960279/","name":"Margaret Qualley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000244/","name":"Sigourney Weaver","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3150488/","name":"Douglas Booth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265852/","name":"Philippe Falardeau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0089507/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044330/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265852/","name":"Philippe Falardeau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5117507/","name":"Joanna Smith Rakoff"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The main character, Jasiek is a burnt out teacher from big city. He is now a caretaker at a former soviet era co-op farm. \n\nMany scenes refer to this post-communist era: the dilapidated police cruiser that gets stuck in mud; the old truck that should be in the museum but out of necessity is still used for transportation.\n\nThe rest of the plot deals with the question of what will happen to the girl and her former teacher.\n\nThis is a very slow moving film without any fast, shaky camera movements. You get to feel the passage of time and the heat of the summer. The colors are beautiful; they would have been even better had they used better equipment. On the other hand the low budget, forced the director to shoot all the scenes in one take. This turned out to be a blessing since every scene is well thought out.\n\nThe director, Andrzej Jakimowski just like Kieslowski takes great care of every detail. There is a scene, hard to believe at first, where the eagle flies away. It has at least two different meanings but what is amazing that something like that actually happened to the director's father.\n\nIf you like to see an uplifting, sometimes funny, sad and quirky movie and at the same time learn about the Einstein relativity theory (the scene on the bridge) you will not be disappointed."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":895,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-10-24","keywords":"farm,ex teacher,rural setting,unemployment,isolation","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1437136/","name":"Olga Prószynska"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435653/","name":"Rafal Guzniczak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109608/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109606/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126437/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The main character, Jasiek is a burnt out teacher from big city. He is now a caretaker at a former soviet era co-op farm. \n\nMany scenes refer to this post-communist era: the dilapidated police cruiser that gets stuck in mud; the old truck that should be in the museum but out of necessity is still used for transportation.\n\nThe rest of the plot deals with the question of what will happen to the girl and her former teacher.\n\nThis is a very slow moving film without any fast, shaky camera movements. You get to feel the passage of time and the heat of the summer. The colors are beautiful; they would have been even better had they used better equipment. On the other hand the low budget, forced the director to shoot all the scenes in one take. This turned out to be a blessing since every scene is well thought out.\n\nThe director, Andrzej Jakimowski just like Kieslowski takes great care of every detail. There is a scene, hard to believe at first, where the eagle flies away. It has at least two different meanings but what is amazing that something like that actually happened to the director's father.\n\nIf you like to see an uplifting, sometimes funny, sad and quirky movie and at the same time learn about the Einstein relativity theory (the scene on the bridge) you will not be disappointed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":895,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-10-24","keywords":"farm,ex teacher,rural setting,unemployment,isolation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1437136/","name":"Olga Prószynska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435653/","name":"Rafal Guzniczak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109608/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109606/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.\n\nWe Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone.

No, I'm not a father yet, but if my girlfriend would tell me that she's pregnant, my world would probably almost collapse at the first moment and apparently that's not the way you should react. This movie tries to make you believe that having a child is everybody's moral duty. We all should make a few dozen babies to find eternal happiness. I'm very sorry but that is just a bunch of ultra conservative Christian crap!!! I know, my reaction is perhaps a bit strong, but this time it all really bothered me too much.\n\nAt first the movie starts very promising. It's funny to see how he reacts when he hears the news that she's pregnant, that his perfectly organized life will be completely turned upside down, ... but as the movie progresses it gets a pedantic tone, which I really didn't like. I agree that the movie had funny parts (for instance the praying mantis part was absolutely brilliant), but it never seemed to stick to a certain genre. Sometimes it was slapstick, than drama, than comedy, than a romantic movie... What bothered me about this movie as well, is the use of so many stereotypes.

No, I'm not a father yet, but if my girlfriend would tell me that she's pregnant, my world would probably almost collapse at the first moment and apparently that's not the way you should react. This movie tries to make you believe that having a child is everybody's moral duty. We all should make a few dozen babies to find eternal happiness. I'm very sorry but that is just a bunch of ultra conservative Christian crap!!! I know, my reaction is perhaps a bit strong, but this time it all really bothered me too much.\n\nAt first the movie starts very promising. It's funny to see how he reacts when he hears the news that she's pregnant, that his perfectly organized life will be completely turned upside down, ... but as the movie progresses it gets a pedantic tone, which I really didn't like. I agree that the movie had funny parts (for instance the praying mantis part was absolutely brilliant), but it never seemed to stick to a certain genre. Sometimes it was slapstick, than drama, than comedy, than a romantic movie... What bothered me about this movie as well, is the use of so many stereotypes. Men are pigs when it comes to having children, babies are miracles, a man acts and reacts like a child... \n\nAll in all this is just a poor girl movie that confirms many of their ideas about men and children.

They are not married but decided to have a child who is a few months old when the movie starts. They have relationship baggage that needs to get sorted out and their accident is the catalyst for that.\n\nIt would be impossible for me to write a logical narrative after viewing the movie, in many ways it is like watching a series of dream sequences.

She and her husband were in a bad automobile accident and when she regained consciousness she wouldn't see. Thus the title 'Wander Darkly.' She developed that experience into this fictional story.\n\nThe couple are Sienna Miller as Adrienne and Diego Luna as Matteo. They are not married but decided to have a child who is a few months old when the movie starts. They have relationship baggage that needs to get sorted out and their accident is the catalyst for that.\n\nIt would be impossible for me to write a logical narrative after viewing the movie, in many ways it is like watching a series of dream sequences. However I enjoyed it, both lead actors are very good in their roles, especially Miller.\n\nI watched it at home on DVD from my public library. My wife skipped, she was on a golf trip.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1239,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-12-11","keywords":"trauma,newborn,funeral,flashback,fire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wander Darkly [trailer]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1811530009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU0ODE1NDAtODlhOC00YjFkLWFmZjktYzNjZDVjOWJkNzg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU0ODE1NDAtODlhOC00YjFkLWFmZjktYzNjZDVjOWJkNzg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A traumatic accident leaves a couple, Adrienne (Sienna Miller) and Matteo (Diego Luna), in a surreal state of being that takes them on a disorienting journey through the duality of their shared moments.

It was co-written and directed by Bartosz Prokopowicz. The film stars Agnieszka Zulewska as Lena, a woman with breast cancer, and Tomasz Schuchardt as Benek, a physically healthy man obsessed with his own suicide.\n\nWhen the two people met, the chemistry--while admittedly strange--is powerful. The rest of the film follows Lena and Benek as they interact with the world, with each other, and with the disease and suicide.\n\nAgnieszka Zulewska must be the most beautiful woman in Poland. It's clear that director Prokopowicz can't take his eyes--or the camera-- off her. It unbalances the film a little, but it's truly amazing to see a skilled actor totally dominate a movie.\n\nWe saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY, as part of the High Falls Film Festival. HFFF is "Celebrating Women in Film." Since the director is a man, this film surely was chosen because of Agnieszka Zulewska's star performance. It will work well on a small screen. Try to find it and watch it--it's worth seeking out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":366,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-02","keywords":"cancer,chemo","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4521098/","name":"Agnieszka Zulewska"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3949598/","name":"Tomasz Schuchardt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826611/","name":"Danuta Stenka"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698616/","name":"Bartosz Prokopowicz"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0502289/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484652/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0391378/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698616/","name":"Bartosz Prokopowicz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5025978/","name":"Katarzyna Sarnowska"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was co-written and directed by Bartosz Prokopowicz. The film stars Agnieszka Zulewska as Lena, a woman with breast cancer, and Tomasz Schuchardt as Benek, a physically healthy man obsessed with his own suicide.\n\nWhen the two people met, the chemistry--while admittedly strange--is powerful. The rest of the film follows Lena and Benek as they interact with the world, with each other, and with the disease and suicide.\n\nAgnieszka Zulewska must be the most beautiful woman in Poland. It's clear that director Prokopowicz can't take his eyes--or the camera-- off her. It unbalances the film a little, but it's truly amazing to see a skilled actor totally dominate a movie.\n\nWe saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY, as part of the High Falls Film Festival. HFFF is "Celebrating Women in Film." Since the director is a man, this film surely was chosen because of Agnieszka Zulewska's star performance. It will work well on a small screen. Try to find it and watch it--it's worth seeking out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":366,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-02","keywords":"cancer,chemo","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4521098/","name":"Agnieszka Zulewska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3949598/","name":"Tomasz Schuchardt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826611/","name":"Danuta Stenka"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698616/","name":"Bartosz Prokopowicz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0502289/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484652/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0391378/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698616/","name":"Bartosz Prokopowicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5025978/","name":"Katarzyna Sarnowska"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was co-written and directed by Bartosz Prokopowicz. The film stars Agnieszka Zulewska as Lena, a woman with breast cancer, and Tomasz Schuchardt as Benek, a physically healthy man obsessed with his own suicide.\n\nWhen the two people met, the chemistry--while admittedly strange--is powerful. The rest of the film follows Lena and Benek as they interact with the world, with each other, and with the disease and suicide.\n\nAgnieszka Zulewska must be the most beautiful woman in Poland. It's clear that director Prokopowicz can't take his eyes--or the camera-- off her.

He is dazzled from the first moment and his admiration grows when Lena not only understands his suicidal preoccupation but shares a similar one. They embark on a crazy journey during which Benek realizes he is not the only man in Lena's life - in addition, the girl has cancer, and she is not attempting to treat it.

It was co-written and directed by Bartosz Prokopowicz. The film stars Agnieszka Zulewska as Lena, a woman with breast cancer, and Tomasz Schuchardt as Benek, a physically healthy man obsessed with his own suicide.\n\nWhen the two people met, the chemistry--while admittedly strange--is powerful. The rest of the film follows Lena and Benek as they interact with the world, with each other, and with the disease and suicide.\n\nAgnieszka Zulewska must be the most beautiful woman in Poland. It's clear that director Prokopowicz can't take his eyes--or the camera-- off her. It unbalances the film a little, but it's truly amazing to see a skilled actor totally dominate a movie.\n\nWe saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY, as part of the High Falls Film Festival.

How he walks, how he stands. I remember thinking that Jake Gyllenhaal had borrowed that physicality for his character in "Brokeback Mountain" and I just realized that Larry McMurtry is the author of both "Brokeback Mountain" and "Hud". He provides us with a look into the modern cowboy that is not only unique but mesmerizing. Paul Newman's Hud is a cad and yet you feel we sense that behind the bravado hides a desperate man looking for something. Something personal and unspoken. Hud is one of my favorite Newman performances. Soulless and yet needy. Is it a coincidence that the only woman that"got away" from Hud is named Alma? - Alma in Spanish means soul - Alma is played by Patricia Neal with power and humanity and she won the Oscar for it. Melvyn Douglas also won the Oscar for his superb performance and Brandon de Wilde deserved one of his own. He is extraordinary. Hud has become an important film in my life and in future viewings in years to come I may discover why.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1963-05-29","keywords":"rodeo cowboy,neo western,texas,rodeo,jack daniels","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2435365401","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcwOTJlMWUtZWIxOS00NTJkLTk0YjUtYjE0MGNlOTZjNTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcwOTJlMWUtZWIxOS00NTJkLTk0YjUtYjE0MGNlOTZjNTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Honest and hard-working Texas rancher Homer Bannon has a conflict with his unscrupulous, selfish, arrogant and egotistical son Hud, who sank into alcoholism after accidentally killing his brother in a car crash."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002048/","name":"Melvyn Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0623658/","name":"Patricia Neal"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0728688/","name":"Martin Ritt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057370/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712419/","name":"Irving Ravetch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290809/","name":"Harriet Frank Jr."},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0573505/","name":"Larry McMurtry"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I remember thinking that Jake Gyllenhaal had borrowed that physicality for his character in "Brokeback Mountain" and I just realized that Larry McMurtry is the author of both "Brokeback Mountain" and "Hud". He provides us with a look into the modern cowboy that is not only unique but mesmerizing. Paul Newman's Hud is a cad and yet you feel we sense that behind the bravado hides a desperate man looking for something. Something personal and unspoken. Hud is one of my favorite Newman performances. Soulless and yet needy. Is it a coincidence that the only woman that"got away" from Hud is named Alma? - Alma in Spanish means soul - Alma is played by Patricia Neal with power and humanity and she won the Oscar for it. Melvyn Douglas also won the Oscar for his superb performance and Brandon de Wilde deserved one of his own. He is extraordinary. Hud has become an important film in my life and in future viewings in years to come I may discover why.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1963-05-29","keywords":"rodeo cowboy,neo western,texas,rodeo,jack daniels","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2435365401","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcwOTJlMWUtZWIxOS00NTJkLTk0YjUtYjE0MGNlOTZjNTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcwOTJlMWUtZWIxOS00NTJkLTk0YjUtYjE0MGNlOTZjNTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Honest and hard-working Texas rancher Homer Bannon has a conflict with his unscrupulous, selfish, arrogant and egotistical son Hud, who sank into alcoholism after accidentally killing his brother in a car crash.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002048/","name":"Melvyn Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0623658/","name":"Patricia Neal"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0728688/","name":"Martin Ritt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057370/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712419/","name":"Irving Ravetch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290809/","name":"Harriet Frank Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0573505/","name":"Larry McMurtry"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The beginning is amazing, and the way we gradually know the different characters, how they are related to each other, and their lives is very engaging. Their existences are far from desired and they want to be somewhere else: if the needed profit will come from a new work or through a great crime, that will vary. Indeed, borders between crime and honest work are not always so rigid, and both are neighbors.

The beginning is amazing, and the way we gradually know the different characters, how they are related to each other, and their lives is very engaging. Their existences are far from desired and they want to be somewhere else: if the needed profit will come from a new work or through a great crime, that will vary. Indeed, borders between crime and honest work are not always so rigid, and both are neighbors. Action scenes are as good as the daily routine ones, and here I saw one of the very best shooting footage. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that there are too many side stories which are not developped until the end, and some kmportant events are never explained or are just forgotten.

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Here's some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.\n\nFirst off, I'd say I agree with the general critical reception: 4/5 stars. To me that means it's a solid movie that delivers at the high end of its genre. JACK REACHER isn't trying to be anything revolutionary, it's more the kind of action thriller audiences haven't seen for a while.\n\nThis isn't MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or even James Bond. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie takes his inspiration from action movies of the late 60s/early 70s like DIRTY HARRY (which has been name checked in a couple reviews already), BULLITT (for the car chase); and maybe another Don Siegel movie, CHARLEY VARRICK. The excitement here doesn't come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Like the action movies just referenced, you thrill to watching a strongly defined protagonist outsmart, outfight and outmaneuver the bad guys.\n\nWhich brings me to the character of Jack Reacher and the casting of Tom Cruise. In the series of novels by Lee Child this movie is based on, Jack Reacher is an ex-MP detective. After a lifetime spent on military bases overseas, he lives as a drifter in the United States who adheres to a life of zero commitments: No house, no job, no car, no possessions, no family. Oh, and he stands 6'5" and weighs 250 lbs.\n\nClearly Tom Cruise doesn't match that physical description. What makes Reacher such a great character in Child's books though has far less to do with his exterior than it does with his intellect. If you've read the series as I have, it's a little strange at first. As the film played out however, I got more relaxed and more into it. This was definitely a movie about Lee Child's hero Jack Reacher, physical differences be damned.\n\nWould I have preferred an unknown actor closer to Child's description to play Reacher on screen? Yes, of course. But I could say that about virtually any character, and often do. I generally want unknowns for everything.\n\nWhich is where Cruise's casting comes in handy a bit. Because his casting sort of guarantees a certain amount of box office, it means the filmmakers can take more chances. Like crafting an action movie that's longer on character and occasional brutal violence and short on mindless action and impossible nonsense.\n\nJACK REACHER was a very satisfying action thriller for me. I felt it captured what I love about Lee Child's thrillers and Jack Reacher in particular. I'd definitely recommend it, and I'm going to see it in the theater again. That's for damn sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-26","keywords":"sniper,coma,quarry,pittsburgh pennsylvania,heads knocked together","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158194201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a trained military sniper who shot five random victims.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0420955/","name":"Richard Jenkins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0769768/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1676193/","name":"Lee Child"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. \n\nYou have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. \n\nEdge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. \n\nThe tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-06-04","keywords":"time loop,alien,alien invasion,dying repeatedly,combat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3591679257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier fighting in a war with aliens finds himself caught in a time loop of his last day in the battle, though he becomes better skilled along the way.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510731/","name":"Doug Liman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890871/","name":"John-Henry Butterworth"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Once upon a time (possibly in Las Vegas) he was a Box Office heavyweight. Now... well, you can probably pick up one of his latest films from those buckets you find of DVDs for £2.99 in petrol stations. However, before his decent into depressingly-bad cinema, he made some pretty fun films. Yes, he's won an Oscar in his time for his deep and meaningful acting, but you won't find any of that here. Just fun.\n\nNicholas Cage plays (basically) Nicholas Cage – only a Nicholas Cage who used to steal expensive cars, only to retire. However, his loose cannon of a brother steals (or doesn't steal – I forget – it doesn't matter!) for (or from) the wrong mobster in L.A. meaning Nicholas Cage the now not-so retired car thief must steal a load of flash motors in one night or his brother ends up in the car crusher (literally!).\n\nIf you like fast cars driving even faster (and, judging by the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise a lot of people do) then this one is basically for you. It's an action film and it's pretty much by the numbers, but, when it's such fun, who cares? Everyone cranks their performances up to eleven and it all comes across as one of those adorable eighties and nineties 'over-the-top' action flicks (yes, I know it was made it in 2000, but it sure feels like a nineties movie) with a real cartoony vibe to it. You have Christopher Ecleston plays the 'evil Brit villain' much like any other evil Brit villains you've seen in cinema. Vinnie Jones and Angelina Jolie are on hand to show their faces, but feel a little underused for what they could have been.\n\nUltimately, it's all on Nicholas Cage's manic shoulders and he does the film proud. It's loud, dumb and it's basically one long car crash that you'll probably be unable to tear your eyes away from.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268704,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-06-09","keywords":"auto theft,car,brother,thief,theft","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000610/","name":"Giovanni Ribisi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0784061/","name":"Dominic Sena"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355181/","name":"H.B.

Once upon a time (possibly in Las Vegas) he was a Box Office heavyweight. Now... well, you can probably pick up one of his latest films from those buckets you find of DVDs for £2.99 in petrol stations. However, before his decent into depressingly-bad cinema, he made some pretty fun films. Yes, he's won an Oscar in his time for his deep and meaningful acting, but you won't find any of that here. Just fun.\n\nNicholas Cage plays (basically) Nicholas Cage – only a Nicholas Cage who used to steal expensive cars, only to retire. However, his loose cannon of a brother steals (or doesn't steal – I forget – it doesn't matter!) for (or from) the wrong mobster in L.A. meaning Nicholas Cage the now not-so retired car thief must steal a load of flash motors in one night or his brother ends up in the car crusher (literally!).\n\nIf you like fast cars driving even faster (and, judging by the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise a lot of people do) then this one is basically for you. It's an action film and it's pretty much by the numbers, but, when it's such fun, who cares? Everyone cranks their performances up to eleven and it all comes across as one of those adorable eighties and nineties 'over-the-top' action flicks (yes, I know it was made it in 2000, but it sure feels like a nineties movie) with a real cartoony vibe to it. You have Christopher Ecleston plays the 'evil Brit villain' much like any other evil Brit villains you've seen in cinema. Vinnie Jones and Angelina Jolie are on hand to show their faces, but feel a little underused for what they could have been.\n\nUltimately, it's all on Nicholas Cage's manic shoulders and he does the film proud. It's loud, dumb and it's basically one long car crash that you'll probably be unable to tear your eyes away from.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268704,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-06-09","keywords":"auto theft,car,brother,thief,theft","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000610/","name":"Giovanni Ribisi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0784061/","name":"Dominic Sena"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355181/","name":"H.B.

The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious "king of a little hill" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.\n\nThere's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258134,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-23","keywords":"yakuza,chase,showdown,dominic toretto character,han seoul oh character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Everything We Know About 'F9'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2943402009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk5ODI0YjUtN2VkYy00YTgyLTg5NGQtYmE1MzQ4MTVhOTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk5ODI0YjUtN2VkYy00YTgyLTg5NGQtYmE1MzQ4MTVhOTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief we put the pedal to the metal on the Fast Saga and everything you need to know about 'F9' (2021)."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085407/","name":"Lucas Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117022/","name":"Zachery Ty Bryan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510168/","name":"Shad Moss"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510912/","name":"Justin Lin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0604555/","name":"Chris Morgan"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story is about a suburban family moves to a new neighborhood with their large yet lovable Great Dane, who has a tendency to wreak havoc in his own oblivious way. Marmaduke is mainly intended for little kids, some adults may enjoy it others might feel light a living hell. The movie has some funny moments and others are kinda foolish. The CGI to make the animals talk are nothing out of this world but decent enough. The story is a little predictable. The cast of voices are the best thing with Owen Wilson as Marmaduke, Fergie as Jezebel, Kiefer Sutherland as Bosco and George Lopez as Carlos. We also have Lee Pace and Judy Greer as Phil and Debbie Winslow, Marmaduke's owners and William H. Macy as Pace's boss. In conclusion, Kids will love Marmaduke and for one strange reason I enjoy it. So if you have children and a very big patience, take them to see this movie. If not well its your choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2010-06-04","keywords":"great dane,dog,rivalry,talking animal,bowl","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1396835353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339460/","name":"Judy Greer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1195855/","name":"Lee Pace"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0223359/","name":"Tom Dey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711422/","name":"Tim Rasmussen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224084/","name":"Vince Di Meglio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1685870/","name":"Brad Anderson"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story is about a suburban family moves to a new neighborhood with their large yet lovable Great Dane, who has a tendency to wreak havoc in his own oblivious way. Marmaduke is mainly intended for little kids, some adults may enjoy it others might feel light a living hell. The movie has some funny moments and others are kinda foolish. The CGI to make the animals talk are nothing out of this world but decent enough. The story is a little predictable. The cast of voices are the best thing with Owen Wilson as Marmaduke, Fergie as Jezebel, Kiefer Sutherland as Bosco and George Lopez as Carlos. We also have Lee Pace and Judy Greer as Phil and Debbie Winslow, Marmaduke's owners and William H. Macy as Pace's boss. In conclusion, Kids will love Marmaduke and for one strange reason I enjoy it. So if you have children and a very big patience, take them to see this movie. If not well its your choice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2010-06-04","keywords":"great dane,dog,rivalry,talking animal,bowl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1396835353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339460/","name":"Judy Greer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1195855/","name":"Lee Pace"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0223359/","name":"Tom Dey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711422/","name":"Tim Rasmussen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224084/","name":"Vince Di Meglio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1685870/","name":"Brad Anderson"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island.

Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.\n\nCarell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick. Wouldn't call this anything close to a classic, but it is a movie families (not the youngsters) can watch together and be entertained ... nothing wrong with that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not because it is a better movie, but because it's very different and a lot more ambitious. Of course that this has a downside, and it's fair to say it as soon as possible: "Australia" is flawed and longer than it should be, and maybe (just maybe) one day it will be viewed as the dream come true of a man very much in love with cinema, and-let's not forget-with love.\n\nWe shouldn't forget that we're talking about Baz Luhrman, we should know what to expect sometimes. Therefore, if the beginning of this film disappoints you a bit, it's completely understandable. We meet a little boy named Nullah (the very promising Brandon Walters), who talks about races and unnamed countries, about a lady everyone calls Mrs. Boss and the road that got her to Australia and more specifically to a place called Faraway Downs in the company of a man they call the Drover.\n\nYes, it's all quite confusing, even more when Luhrman throws in a historical context that, I suspect, he doesn't really care much about. But everything is fine because we get to meet the stars of the show. Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade. Her job ends up being less risky than Hugh Jackman's, who plays this Drover as a successful combination of what he's been giving us since he came into the scene: the action hero, the tough guy, the romantic and sensitive lover and the sexy man who makes women scream.\n\nMaybe I'm not being critical enough, but there's a scene in which the Drover appears dressed up in a suit, clean-shaven I promise you that every women in the theater exhaled. Does this mean something to you? To me, it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments? "Australia" is pure melodrama, and I compliment its director for making it look that way without any shame. The keys can be seen all along the ride: the repetition of clichéd phrases, the intense close-ups, the slow-motion parts of the characters, the epic proportions of David Hirschfelder's score, the establishment of a song that accompanies the characters through their endless journey and the use of narration in places it didn't need to be; the same with some images.\n\nHowever, the movie is one wonderful image after another (cinematographer Mandy Walker, from Australia-the country-; best of luck with the Oscar nomination you deserve), and it wins the audience like few movies out there these days can, providing delightful entertainment; you may discuss if it does this fairly, or if it cheats and it manipulates. You may also discuss the ambiguous ending.\n\nOne more thing. As with any dream, there's a moment in which we wake up; and that moment for Luhrman has to do with believing his picture could get to the race of Best Picture contenders, like his fantastic "Moulin Rouge!". But as I said, this movie is very different from the latter one, and Luhrman is no James Cameron That one really had it the whole way.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time reversal,time paradox,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: "Lifting." It features a novice "animator" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.\n\nCount on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.\n\nIn this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by "the critic." So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.\n\nIt appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how "Ted's law" is followed: the distance between the "real" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the "living cartoon" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.\n\nSo these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.\n\nHaving said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.\n\nOne of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)\n\nYou can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.\n\nBut there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.\n\nThere's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.\n\nThe credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ""Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film." You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.\n\nIts a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.\n\nOne character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. \n\nThese folks at Pixar are good. Darn good.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":691185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In my humble opinion, if you are making films and you want to convey certain feelings and messages to your audience, this ought to be reflected in your cinematic approach as a whole, not in just a few lines of dialogue (which in this film is infuriatingly repetitive). Cinema is, after all, a very powerful medium and, if one posesses the skill, one may be able to convey a thousand messages in just one frame without anyone having to speak a single word. However, making your actors repeat the same things for two hours and in a such overblown manner, is dull, uninspired and a little insulting to the viewer's intelligence (not to mention that it adds to the characters' artificiality).\n\nAll in all, the film leaves a great deal to be desired and that is really a pity, because an important figure such as Queen Maria and a major geopolitical event like the creation of Greater Romania deserve much better than cheap romanticism. I am amazed that, having such a great material in their hands, the creators of the film could offer nothing more than a series of heavily used clichés. They may be the safe option and guarantee tickets, but, at the end of the day, all they leave behind is an audience addicted to low-quality filmmaking and, on a second level, a number of misconceptions regarding Romania's modern past.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1938,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-08","keywords":"paris peace conference,romania,world war one,treaty of versailles","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi904511513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5404849/","name":"Roxana Lupu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088951/","name":"Daniel Plier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253355/","name":"Richard Elfyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087275/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0030727/","name":"Gabi Antal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In my humble opinion, if you are making films and you want to convey certain feelings and messages to your audience, this ought to be reflected in your cinematic approach as a whole, not in just a few lines of dialogue (which in this film is infuriatingly repetitive). Cinema is, after all, a very powerful medium and, if one posesses the skill, one may be able to convey a thousand messages in just one frame without anyone having to speak a single word. However, making your actors repeat the same things for two hours and in a such overblown manner, is dull, uninspired and a little insulting to the viewer's intelligence (not to mention that it adds to the characters' artificiality).\n\nAll in all, the film leaves a great deal to be desired and that is really a pity, because an important figure such as Queen Maria and a major geopolitical event like the creation of Greater Romania deserve much better than cheap romanticism. I am amazed that, having such a great material in their hands, the creators of the film could offer nothing more than a series of heavily used clichés. They may be the safe option and guarantee tickets, but, at the end of the day, all they leave behind is an audience addicted to low-quality filmmaking and, on a second level, a number of misconceptions regarding Romania's modern past.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1938,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-08","keywords":"paris peace conference,romania,world war one,treaty of versailles","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi904511513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5404849/","name":"Roxana Lupu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088951/","name":"Daniel Plier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253355/","name":"Richard Elfyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087275/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0030727/","name":"Gabi Antal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: "Lifting." It features a novice "animator" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.\n\nCount on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.\n\nIn this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by "the critic." So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.\n\nIt appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how "Ted's law" is followed: the distance between the "real" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the "living cartoon" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.\n\nSo these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.\n\nHaving said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.\n\nOne of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)\n\nYou can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.\n\nBut there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.\n\nThere's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.\n\nThe credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ""Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film." You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.\n\nIts a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.\n\nOne character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. \n\nThese folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":672861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-08-22","keywords":"rat,chef,ratatouille,cooking,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ratatouille","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906147865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2, Post"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004951/","name":"Brad Garrett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738918/","name":"Lou Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135296/","name":"Jim Capobianco"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.\n\nLet's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":704449,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3115057433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001321/","name":"Richard Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the first 5 minutes, there're some shocks especially for the viewers who've watched the first film. The aftermath of the 1st film was told in brief to give the background plot for Rama the protagonist character. So it's basically recommended for the viewers to watch the first film before watching. \n\nWith quite many characters're being involved, to make it less easier for the viewers to identify the characters, most of them only have short names and unique names (although it got me confused a little at some time till i was finally able to know them all). The most important key throughout this film's its violent top-notch fighting choreography which's jaw dropping and breath-taking. Also the view take (cinematic technique) in this film's simply marvelous, one which i really enjoyed's the car chase scene. It's such a superb performance to take those kinds of angles. I tell you, the story's a bit much equivalent with as if a mixing of "The Departed" + "The Godfather" + Gory Martial Arts, so in my opinion it's unwise to miss watching it. \n\nFurthermore, this sequel is indeed a confirming proof that Gareth Evans's undoubtedly an experienced and adept action film writer-director whom i think should be eyed and wanted by the Hollywood producers to direct/write decent action movies, with martial arts but perhaps less violent. Iko Uwais, although his total screen-time percentage's less (reduced because of the more complicated story n characters) compared with the first film and the role of his character is, didn't lose his hero persona, he constantly showed off his skills in the martial arts by fighting tons of enemies, got a bit improved in his acting (thanks to the story with its more dialogues).\n\nI urgedly forbid any parent to bring their young little children to watch this movie. Also for the viewers with weak-stomachs (anti-violence) definitely might want to reconsider and avoid watching this film, because it's utterly quite gruesome. After the film ended, you might find yourselves asking about some things which're left unsure and dubious.

In the first 5 minutes, there're some shocks especially for the viewers who've watched the first film. The aftermath of the 1st film was told in brief to give the background plot for Rama the protagonist character. So it's basically recommended for the viewers to watch the first film before watching. \n\nWith quite many characters're being involved, to make it less easier for the viewers to identify the characters, most of them only have short names and unique names (although it got me confused a little at some time till i was finally able to know them all). The most important key throughout this film's its violent top-notch fighting choreography which's jaw dropping and breath-taking. Also the view take (cinematic technique) in this film's simply marvelous, one which i really enjoyed's the car chase scene. It's such a superb performance to take those kinds of angles. I tell you, the story's a bit much equivalent with as if a mixing of "The Departed" + "The Godfather" + Gory Martial Arts, so in my opinion it's unwise to miss watching it. \n\nFurthermore, this sequel is indeed a confirming proof that Gareth Evans's undoubtedly an experienced and adept action film writer-director whom i think should be eyed and wanted by the Hollywood producers to direct/write decent action movies, with martial arts but perhaps less violent. Iko Uwais, although his total screen-time percentage's less (reduced because of the more complicated story n characters) compared with the first film and the role of his character is, didn't lose his hero persona, he constantly showed off his skills in the martial arts by fighting tons of enemies, got a bit improved in his acting (thanks to the story with its more dialogues).\n\nI urgedly forbid any parent to bring their young little children to watch this movie. Also for the viewers with weak-stomachs (anti-violence) definitely might want to reconsider and avoid watching this film, because it's utterly quite gruesome. After the film ended, you might find yourselves asking about some things which're left unsure and dubious. So gotta keep your eyes out for the continuation in the next last film of the planned trilogy which i reckon must've not come out yet at least not until 2017.\n\nA must-see film for the action movie fans.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118911,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-04-11","keywords":"violence,prison,jakarta indonesia,kitchen fight,corrupt police officer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi530950937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Immediately following the events of the original, Officer Rama is pressured to join an anti-corruption task force to guarantee protection for his wife and child.

Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. \n\nThe acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders. The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller. The cameo by the ecstatic Indian astronaut singing around "Mera jootha hai Japani" in space was hilarious as well. \n\nOther than being an adventurous suspense thriller, the slow character- development helps us to form an emotional bond as well. So, by the time the movie reaches climax, you're in it as much as the heroic lead, Dr. Ryan Stone. The mesmerizingly-orchestrated meteoric-shower-like scene of the entering spacecraft, towards the end of the movie, is one of the best executed scenes of cinematic history!\n\nWhether you're a fan of science-fiction thrillers or not, whether you're a fan of 3D films or not, (to quote the lead characters from the movie) either way, it's gonna be one hell of a ride!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":793049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In recent years, however, most of these have been multi-part series made for television, a medium which often seems better equipped to deal with Dickens's complexities than does the cinema. The most popular of his works in the cinema has been "A Christmas Carol", which is a novella rather than a novel, followed by "Oliver Twist" and "Great Expectations", both of which are among his shorter novels, and which are often simplified for the screen. Roman Polanski's recent "Oliver Twist", for example, omitted many of Dickens's details and sub-plots in order to concentrate on the essence of the story.\n\n"Nicholas Nickleby", by contrast, is one of Dickens's lengthier novels, so it was perhaps a brave move to adapt it for the screen. The title character is the son of an impoverished country gentleman. When his father dies heavily in debt, young Nicholas sets out for London with his mother and sister Kate, hoping that his wealthy uncle Ralph will be able to help them. Ralph, however, proves to be arrogant, cold-hearted and avaricious. He takes Kate into his home, motivated not by kindness but by the hope that he might be able to marry her off to his business associate, Sir Mulberry Hawke. He sends Nicholas to Yorkshire to work as an assistant teacher in a run-down boys' boarding school, run by a sadistic headmaster named Wackford Squeers. Nicholas is appalled not only by Squeers's ignorance but also by his neglect of and cruelty towards the boys in his care; he is eventually forced to leave the school after intervening to prevent Squeers beating a crippled boy named Smike, who will play an important role in future plot developments. After a brief interval as an actor, Nicholas returns to London to be reunited with his family.\n\nDickens's villains are generally more memorable than his heroes (and even more so than his heroines, who are often rather colourless), and that is reflected in this film. Even an actress as lovely as Anne Hathaway tends to fade into the background as the saintly Madeline, Nicholas's love-interest. Romola Garai is rather livelier as the spirited Kate, and Charlie Hunnam makes her brother an honourable and brave, if headstrong, hero. The performances that stand out, however, are from Jim Broadbent as the vicious Squeers, Juliet Stephenson as his equally unpleasant wife, Edward Fox as the dissipated lecher Sir Mulberry (who turns his attentions to Madeline when he realises that Kate is not for him) and Christopher Plummer as Ralph, outwardly calm and rational but inwardly cold and stony-hearted, a man who cares for nobody except himself and for nothing except his bank balance. It is noteworthy that Ralph's luxurious house is filled with stuffed animals and birds, presumably intended to symbolise his cruelty and sadism. The one piece of casting I didn't like was that of "Dame Edna Everage" (a creation of the Australian comedian Barry Humphries) as Mrs Crummles; the idea of a fictitious female character being played by another fictitious character, who is herself being played by a male actor, is a bizarre, almost surreal, one. The only place for a pantomime dame is in a pantomime.\n\nThere have been complaints on this board that some reviewers' favourite characters or episodes from the novel have been omitted from the film, but such simplification is inevitable if a nine hundred page novel is to be adapted into a feature film with a running time of just over two hours. What matters is that the feel of the film is authentically Dickensian, and this is achieved here, not only through the recreation, in best "heritage cinema" style, of the England of the 1840s, but also through the steadily growing sense that good will triumph over evil, that the heroes will be vindicated and that the villains will receive their just deserts. This is a very good Dickens adaptation, on a par with Polanski's film and much better than Alfonso Cuaron's eccentric "Great Expectations". 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-06-27","keywords":"uncle nephew relationship,based on novel,alliterative title,1850s,character name as title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nicholas Nickleby","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007237913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkNjM4NDAtMjczZS00NWUyLWJlZTAtZjdjZGQyY2IwNmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkNjM4NDAtMjczZS00NWUyLWJlZTAtZjdjZGQyY2IwNmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Nicholas Nickleby"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0402271/","name":"Charlie Hunnam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068260/","name":"Jamie Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001626/","name":"Christopher Plummer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569790/","name":"Douglas McGrath"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037384/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002042/","name":"Charles Dickens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569790/","name":"Douglas McGrath"}],"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A group of people in an abandoned steel mill (it doesnt even look like a steel mill, it looks interesting, but steel wasnt produced on that site) setting it up for a live role playing game, then spooky things start to happen.\n\nThe plot is full of holes (if you had an abandoned secret research facility why would you rent it out to a bunch of inquisitive LARPERS?), the science is equally unlikely (transferring "souls") All the characters are completely unlikeable, they are either using each other, or sleeping with each other, or ignoring bad things that are happening, there is quite literally nobody to root for.\n\nThe one character I did like, because he was handsome and had a jersey I would like to own (yes, reasons to like characters in this series are just. That. Tenuous...) ends up dead.\n\nIt may have worked as a film, but theres just not enough matrerial here for a series, if you edited the whole thing down to an hour and a half it would still be an mediocre "ok one of those" films you watch on a friday night when you cant be bothered going out and dont want to think too much..","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In recent years, however, most of these have been multi-part series made for television, a medium which often seems better equipped to deal with Dickens's complexities than does the cinema. The most popular of his works in the cinema has been "A Christmas Carol", which is a novella rather than a novel, followed by "Oliver Twist" and "Great Expectations", both of which are among his shorter novels, and which are often simplified for the screen. Roman Polanski's recent "Oliver Twist", for example, omitted many of Dickens's details and sub-plots in order to concentrate on the essence of the story.\n\n"Nicholas Nickleby", by contrast, is one of Dickens's lengthier novels, so it was perhaps a brave move to adapt it for the screen. The title character is the son of an impoverished country gentleman. When his father dies heavily in debt, young Nicholas sets out for London with his mother and sister Kate, hoping that his wealthy uncle Ralph will be able to help them. Ralph, however, proves to be arrogant, cold-hearted and avaricious. He takes Kate into his home, motivated not by kindness but by the hope that he might be able to marry her off to his business associate, Sir Mulberry Hawke. He sends Nicholas to Yorkshire to work as an assistant teacher in a run-down boys' boarding school, run by a sadistic headmaster named Wackford Squeers. Nicholas is appalled not only by Squeers's ignorance but also by his neglect of and cruelty towards the boys in his care; he is eventually forced to leave the school after intervening to prevent Squeers beating a crippled boy named Smike, who will play an important role in future plot developments. After a brief interval as an actor, Nicholas returns to London to be reunited with his family.\n\nDickens's villains are generally more memorable than his heroes (and even more so than his heroines, who are often rather colourless), and that is reflected in this film. Even an actress as lovely as Anne Hathaway tends to fade into the background as the saintly Madeline, Nicholas's love-interest. Romola Garai is rather livelier as the spirited Kate, and Charlie Hunnam makes her brother an honourable and brave, if headstrong, hero. The performances that stand out, however, are from Jim Broadbent as the vicious Squeers, Juliet Stephenson as his equally unpleasant wife, Edward Fox as the dissipated lecher Sir Mulberry (who turns his attentions to Madeline when he realises that Kate is not for him) and Christopher Plummer as Ralph, outwardly calm and rational but inwardly cold and stony-hearted, a man who cares for nobody except himself and for nothing except his bank balance.

In recent years, however, most of these have been multi-part series made for television, a medium which often seems better equipped to deal with Dickens's complexities than does the cinema. The most popular of his works in the cinema has been "A Christmas Carol", which is a novella rather than a novel, followed by "Oliver Twist" and "Great Expectations", both of which are among his shorter novels, and which are often simplified for the screen. Roman Polanski's recent "Oliver Twist", for example, omitted many of Dickens's details and sub-plots in order to concentrate on the essence of the story.\n\n"Nicholas Nickleby", by contrast, is one of Dickens's lengthier novels, so it was perhaps a brave move to adapt it for the screen. The title character is the son of an impoverished country gentleman. When his father dies heavily in debt, young Nicholas sets out for London with his mother and sister Kate, hoping that his wealthy uncle Ralph will be able to help them. Ralph, however, proves to be arrogant, cold-hearted and avaricious. He takes Kate into his home, motivated not by kindness but by the hope that he might be able to marry her off to his business associate, Sir Mulberry Hawke. He sends Nicholas to Yorkshire to work as an assistant teacher in a run-down boys' boarding school, run by a sadistic headmaster named Wackford Squeers. Nicholas is appalled not only by Squeers's ignorance but also by his neglect of and cruelty towards the boys in his care; he is eventually forced to leave the school after intervening to prevent Squeers beating a crippled boy named Smike, who will play an important role in future plot developments. After a brief interval as an actor, Nicholas returns to London to be reunited with his family.\n\nDickens's villains are generally more memorable than his heroes (and even more so than his heroines, who are often rather colourless), and that is reflected in this film. Even an actress as lovely as Anne Hathaway tends to fade into the background as the saintly Madeline, Nicholas's love-interest. Romola Garai is rather livelier as the spirited Kate, and Charlie Hunnam makes her brother an honourable and brave, if headstrong, hero. The performances that stand out, however, are from Jim Broadbent as the vicious Squeers, Juliet Stephenson as his equally unpleasant wife, Edward Fox as the dissipated lecher Sir Mulberry (who turns his attentions to Madeline when he realises that Kate is not for him) and Christopher Plummer as Ralph, outwardly calm and rational but inwardly cold and stony-hearted, a man who cares for nobody except himself and for nothing except his bank balance. It is noteworthy that Ralph's luxurious house is filled with stuffed animals and birds, presumably intended to symbolise his cruelty and sadism. The one piece of casting I didn't like was that of "Dame Edna Everage" (a creation of the Australian comedian Barry Humphries) as Mrs Crummles; the idea of a fictitious female character being played by another fictitious character, who is herself being played by a male actor, is a bizarre, almost surreal, one. The only place for a pantomime dame is in a pantomime.\n\nThere have been complaints on this board that some reviewers' favourite characters or episodes from the novel have been omitted from the film, but such simplification is inevitable if a nine hundred page novel is to be adapted into a feature film with a running time of just over two hours.

(I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man.) A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it's likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip.

She has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and goes off, away from home, to experience one adventure after another.\n\nThe movie tries too hard to be serious and hip at the same time and fails miserably. The acting is predictable and one-dimensional and the plot and "adventures" incredulous.\n\nThe only noteworthy aspect of this movie is that it has perhaps the funniest title of any movie in recent memory. Still, stay away, far away, from this film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-10-01","keywords":"profanity in title,title appears in writing,tattoo on chest,father daughter relationship,terminal illness","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5321052/","name":"Sinje Irslinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4056269/","name":"Max Hubacher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001709/","name":"Til Schweiger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1839743/","name":"André Erkau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183929/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049524/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010760/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1452691/","name":"Thomas Vass","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457776/","name":"Katja Kittendorf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10422371/","name":"Frank Pape"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In fall of 1991 Thurgood Marshall retired from SCOTUS, and, feeling the pressure to nominate a black man to the court, Bush picked Clarence Thomas, a man who many felt wasn't qualified for the court (as Jeffrey Wright's character says at one point, "I have students who are better qualified than Clarence Thomas"). But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions. It got out to the press, she had to go testify, as did Thomas, and all this before a seemingly immovable date for the man's confirmation.\n\nThis all could have made for a compelling mini-series, or an even longer movie. What is a little disappointing about is that this is probably the best this kind of movie could be, but it's still not quite good enough, or I should say that the detail isn't exactly strong enough. Mostly I found that the depiction of Clarence Thomas not exactly weak but basic: for such a man who I may find reprehensible (from before and during his 25 past years on the court), Wendell Pierce gives Thomas as a person, and character in this story, some dignity, and Anita Wright as Clarence Thomas' wife as well. But what about anything else aside from his indignation and sad faces? What else was/is there to Thomas? \n\nMaybe that just wasn't the focus, and director Fumiyama (of last year's surprise critical hit Dope), wanted to keep it on the politics and especially the media - many figures who you might recognize from CNN and elsewhere in cable news pop up as younger selves - certainly keeps a good eye on that. But what does make an impact and what is certainly good to look past the flaws here, are a) Kerry Washington's performance, which is so unwavering in making Anita Hill a figure of sympathy but also aching empathy, completely stripping anything else except this woman and having to put up being solid in front of the committee. And b) how the story and movie treats the whole aspect of how equal rights were not there in 1991, and may still not be (or, to put it another way, despite the changes the struggle is ongoing), for women in this country.\n\nLike the recent People vs OJ series, we get a story that seems to deal a lot in race - Thomas' "High tech lynching" comment that struck an emotional chord for some but was seen as being disingenuous by others - and yet it's really about how women fit it, or certainly do not, in a world full of men. Images of women and how they talk and react, every little thing that they say, is under the kind of scrutiny here that men just don't have to face, at least not to this level. Confirmation is about the representation of a woman's image in politics, in the media, in the public at large, and what that does when up against a "street fight" as one of the raging white male Republican senators says. You can read a lot into what the hearings, as seen in this story, say about the national public character, and yet it's displayed for us to see in those hearings, and the behind-the-scenes fights and digging for dirt via the Republican senators, as opposed to spelled out all the time.\n\nConfirmation doesn't stretch entirely too far for it to be great, or quite on the level of Recount or Game Change as far as HBO original movies about hot-button/controversial political stories in this country from the modern age, but within what it tries to do, and from the acting from all the players that is never less than convincing (Kinnear, who plays a rather unsympathetic Senator Biden, who screwed up things in the hearing just as far as scheduling people to testify, is one of those), it works. I'd even watch it again if just to see how Washington pulls off the majority of her scenes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-16","keywords":"supreme court,1990s,reference to anita hill,african american judge,black male judge","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3610293529","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States' Supreme Court is called into question when former colleague, Anita Hill, testifies that he had sexually harassed her."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913488/","name":"Kerry Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682495/","name":"Wendell Pierce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266622/","name":"Rick Famuyiwa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173527/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335666/","name":"Susannah Grant"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States Supreme Court is called into question when Anita Hill, a former colleague, testifies that he sexually harassed her." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt4608402/","name":"Confirmation","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MjMwMDkyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTY2ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States Supreme Court is called into question when Anita Hill, a former colleague, testifies that he sexually harassed her.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt4608402/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Quinoa1984","dateCreated":"2016-04-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"not great, but its story speaks volumes","reviewBody":"The bottom line with Confirmation is that it's not complex as far as the plot goes, and this is particularly if you know the history. In fall of 1991 Thurgood Marshall retired from SCOTUS, and, feeling the pressure to nominate a black man to the court, Bush picked Clarence Thomas, a man who many felt wasn't qualified for the court (as Jeffrey Wright's character says at one point, "I have students who are better qualified than Clarence Thomas"). But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions. It got out to the press, she had to go testify, as did Thomas, and all this before a seemingly immovable date for the man's confirmation.\n\nThis all could have made for a compelling mini-series, or an even longer movie. What is a little disappointing about is that this is probably the best this kind of movie could be, but it's still not quite good enough, or I should say that the detail isn't exactly strong enough. Mostly I found that the depiction of Clarence Thomas not exactly weak but basic: for such a man who I may find reprehensible (from before and during his 25 past years on the court), Wendell Pierce gives Thomas as a person, and character in this story, some dignity, and Anita Wright as Clarence Thomas' wife as well. But what about anything else aside from his indignation and sad faces? What else was/is there to Thomas? \n\nMaybe that just wasn't the focus, and director Fumiyama (of last year's surprise critical hit Dope), wanted to keep it on the politics and especially the media - many figures who you might recognize from CNN and elsewhere in cable news pop up as younger selves - certainly keeps a good eye on that. But what does make an impact and what is certainly good to look past the flaws here, are a) Kerry Washington's performance, which is so unwavering in making Anita Hill a figure of sympathy but also aching empathy, completely stripping anything else except this woman and having to put up being solid in front of the committee. And b) how the story and movie treats the whole aspect of how equal rights were not there in 1991, and may still not be (or, to put it another way, despite the changes the struggle is ongoing), for women in this country.\n\nLike the recent People vs OJ series, we get a story that seems to deal a lot in race - Thomas' "High tech lynching" comment that struck an emotional chord for some but was seen as being disingenuous by others - and yet it's really about how women fit it, or certainly do not, in a world full of men. Images of women and how they talk and react, every little thing that they say, is under the kind of scrutiny here that men just don't have to face, at least not to this level. Confirmation is about the representation of a woman's image in politics, in the media, in the public at large, and what that does when up against a "street fight" as one of the raging white male Republican senators says. You can read a lot into what the hearings, as seen in this story, say about the national public character, and yet it's displayed for us to see in those hearings, and the behind-the-scenes fights and digging for dirt via the Republican senators, as opposed to spelled out all the time.\n\nConfirmation doesn't stretch entirely too far for it to be great, or quite on the level of Recount or Game Change as far as HBO original movies about hot-button/controversial political stories in this country from the modern age, but within what it tries to do, and from the acting from all the players that is never less than convincing (Kinnear, who plays a rather unsympathetic Senator Biden, who screwed up things in the hearing just as far as scheduling people to testify, is one of those), it works. I'd even watch it again if just to see how Washington pulls off the majority of her scenes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-16","keywords":"supreme court,1990s,reference to anita hill,african american judge,black male judge","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3610293529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States' Supreme Court is called into question when former colleague, Anita Hill, testifies that he had sexually harassed her.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913488/","name":"Kerry Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682495/","name":"Wendell Pierce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266622/","name":"Rick Famuyiwa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173527/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335666/","name":"Susannah Grant"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She plays second fiddle to Anne Hathaway here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. Meryl Streep is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From Sophie's Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, Meryl/Miranda transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. Anne Hathaway is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see Meryl be Miranda. You'll have a lot of fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":391729,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-11-15","keywords":"magazine,fashion,fashion industry,chick flick,work","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Devil Wears Prada","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1425080601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NjEzNGUtZWRkMy00OTE4LTk2OTktYjI2ODM3NDYwMWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NjEzNGUtZWRkMy00OTE4LTk2OTktYjI2ODM3NDYwMWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004978/","name":"Adrian Grenier"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291205/","name":"David Frankel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174362/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112459/","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1916979/","name":"Lauren Weisberger"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

She plays second fiddle to Anne Hathaway here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. Meryl Streep is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From Sophie's Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, Meryl/Miranda transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. Anne Hathaway is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see Meryl be Miranda. You'll have a lot of fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":391729,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-11-15","keywords":"magazine,fashion,fashion industry,chick flick,work","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Devil Wears Prada","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1425080601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NjEzNGUtZWRkMy00OTE4LTk2OTktYjI2ODM3NDYwMWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NjEzNGUtZWRkMy00OTE4LTk2OTktYjI2ODM3NDYwMWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004978/","name":"Adrian Grenier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291205/","name":"David Frankel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174362/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112459/","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1916979/","name":"Lauren Weisberger"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Another reviewer was dismayed by all of the citizens lining up for their welfare cheques. An exaggeration yes, because it is a film, but the key message he missed was how noble and honest, despite their desperate scam, the people of Newfoundland are. When I took my family for a vacation in Newfoundland we were mightily impressed by the scenic beauty but even more impressed by its people and their genuine interest in others. It made us proud to be Canadian and this film makes me proud of the Canadian film industry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-05-30","keywords":"cricket,newfoundland,population count,atm,doctor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi568831257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQxOTA0NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQ2MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQxOTA0NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQ2MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A small fishing village must procure a local doctor to secure a lucrative business contract.

The scenes of the Newfoundland coast were breath taking. A great little story about a community struggling for survival. Another reviewer was dismayed by all of the citizens lining up for their welfare cheques. An exaggeration yes, because it is a film, but the key message he missed was how noble and honest, despite their desperate scam, the people of Newfoundland are. When I took my family for a vacation in Newfoundland we were mightily impressed by the scenic beauty but even more impressed by its people and their genuine interest in others. It made us proud to be Canadian and this film makes me proud of the Canadian film industry.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-05-30","keywords":"cricket,newfoundland,population count,atm,doctor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi568831257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQxOTA0NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQ2MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQxOTA0NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQ2MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A small fishing village must procure a local doctor to secure a lucrative business contract.

These stories are delivered with such honesty, and rawness that you can't help but say to yourself: "oh my God, I feel like that too!" or "that happens to me!" We all know of someone, who has experienced 'something' similar to the story lines. That's the beauty of "Sex And The City". It tells it like it is. And Something has to be said for the BRILLIANT performances each and every one of these women (and men) gives. Sarah Jessica Parker is amazing. She radiates every emotion to perfection. Kim Cattrall is my favorite. She's a blonde bombshell who does not beat around the bush. Her character is so openly honest with 'everything', you can't help but love her character "Samantha" and either cheer or crack up at her episodes. Cynthia Nixon's character is awesome. I think we all have a little bit of "Miranda" in all of us. And Kristin Davis as the annoying, "Charlotte", gives the story lines that feeling of "hope" and "innocence". This show truly deserves all the praise and awards it's currently getting. Do yourself a favor, buy and see "Sex And The City" and see for yourself. You'll be hooked, and you'll discover a world that many try to "avoid". We're only human!

They eat the shine from the few special children. One of those is Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) who survived the Overlook Hotel with his mother. He grows up hiding his Shining. Rose recruits Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) as the new pusher. Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) is a young girl with the Shining.\n\nI watched the director's cut which is three hours long. Even the shorter version is two and a half hours. It's rather long for a modern theatrical movie. This is really a Netflix mini-series. Otherwise, there are generally two major issues. The first is that the start stumbles a little. Wendy should be besides herself. Young Danny supposedly relieved her of her crazy anxiety due to the events and the movie needs to make a big show of it. Also the little girl needs to have the horrifying murder like Jacob Tremblay. A movie needs to jump off with both feet. A good start is Pennywise in the sewer eating a child. This movie's start should punch you in the face. The second is that Abra is too powerful. The only true threat comes from Crow. The Winnebago gang is inferior and it never feels that dangerous. Also why didn't Dan bring guns to the Overlook? They are not immune to bullets. It seems like a more effective weapon than an axe. Sure the axe has meaning but it is still an axe.\n\nThere are some very compelling aspects in this movie. It's interesting to have this movie's versions of the old movie. McGregor is great and the girl is great. Rebecca Ferguson is very interesting as a villain. Again, the tension would be heightened if she's more powerful than the girl. Overall, it's an intriguing companion piece to the classic.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-10-31","keywords":"based on the works of stephen king,hat,vampire,the shining,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi212254489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUwMDBhNTEtNzc3Yi00NDU0LWEzZWYtMTEzYTJiZGEzNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUwMDBhNTEtNzc3Yi00NDU0LWEzZWYtMTEzYTJiZGEzNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Years following the events of "The Shining," a now-adult Dan Torrence meets a young girl with similar powers as his and tries to protect her from a cult known as The True Knot who prey on children with powers to remain immortal."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272581/","name":"Rebecca Ferguson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7738797/","name":"Kyliegh Curran"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093039/","name":"Mike Flanagan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059753/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093039/","name":"Mike Flanagan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"}],"duration":"PT2H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Again it's not so much about where it's going, but how it gets there (the "road" so to speak, even literally in this case).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45480,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-09-02","keywords":"post apocalypse,closing monologue,covered with cockroaches,blood on face,bra","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Carriers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2346123801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjk4NzU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI3MTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjk4NzU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI3MTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four friends fleeing a viral pandemic soon learn they are more dangerous than any virus.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005305/","name":"Piper Perabo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1086384/","name":"Lou Taylor Pucci"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0665041/","name":"David Pastor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1883612/","name":"Àlex Pastor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017713/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1883612/","name":"Àlex Pastor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0665041/","name":"David Pastor"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The action twists and turns, the characters may or may not be what they seem to be, and crosses follow double-crosses. Thus, there is little time for the viewer to be bored or to ponder the implausibility of it all. But, in a sleek glossy film such as this one, logic is not a key factor, it's the look and the action that count, and both of those attributes, especially the look, make "Entrapment" an entertaining film. Sean Connery, who plays an aging master thief, can anchor any film that he appears in, and this one is no exception. His presence alone grounds the movie and nearly makes the implausible plausible. However, while Connery is one of a handful of men who have retained their looks and masculine appeal beyond middle age, the likelihood that the luscious Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is at the peak of her beauty here, would fall for him tests the bounds of credibility. Perhaps the romance was written in as a fantasy for us near-codgers and to give us hope. Besides the excellent cinematography of the human scenery, which also includes the dependable Will Patton and Ving Rhames, the lush photography of the Scottish Highlands offers an unsolicited advertisement for the Scottish National Tourist Board. If rooms were available in the luxurious castle that Connery uses in the film, this would have been written there.\n\nThus, "Entrapment" seems to have everything: beautiful people, solid performances, breathtaking scenery, suspense, and excitement. There is definitely enough here to entertain a not-too-discriminating viewer for two hours. Of course, afterward, one might ponder why all of the expensive high-tech security systems that are depicted in the film quickly fall victim to a pair of thieves who seem more amused with themselves than intense and focused when they are stealing such incredible sums of money. If theft were as easy and casual as Connery and Zeta-Jones make it seem to be, we could all have a lot more fun in life plotting and executing heists instead of commuting and staring at computer monitors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112016,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"1999-04-30","keywords":"art,art thief,master thief,sexual tension,heist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Entrapment","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1789198617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ1NzA2OWUtZDc3OC00OGM1LWFmZTAtNmM2NzEyYTA0Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ1NzA2OWUtZDc3OC00OGM1LWFmZTAtNmM2NzEyYTA0Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000750/","name":"Jon Amiel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103746/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0060103/","name":"Ronald Bass"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381110/","name":"Michael Hertzberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115310/","name":"William Broyles Jr."}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. \n\nSteven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1298531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1998-07-24","keywords":"rescue mission,world war two,army,france,unsubtitled foreign language","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saving Private Ryan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1701906201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this wartime drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"duration":"PT2H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And the movie which is basically a children's vehicle for rapper/actor/producer Ice Cube who is starring in "Are We There Yet?" is not worth the ride nor the price of admission. Too bad for Ice Cube though. He is a winning presence with an appealing deadpan comic shtick in the "Friday",and "Barbershop" movies as well as here,but he is hampered by the subpar work of the writers who are totally responsible for this mayhem of family dysfunctional values. Here he is not only muggin the camera at its worst,it is also the most pathetic display of sympathy by a actor in recent months. Here is what the producers did here. First they bring on two of the stars from the first original "Friday" movie(Ice Cube and a suddenly aged Nia Long),and put them in a film that is supposed to be family oriented material,since the film uses every cliché from several films to bring this to the point of ridiculous mayhem. From there,they bring on two of the most misbehaving,obnoxious kids ever to sully the screen,exhibiting misbehavior to such an extreme that it goes beyond the point of normality which to say goes way beneath rude and disrespectful.

And the movie which is basically a children's vehicle for rapper/actor/producer Ice Cube who is starring in "Are We There Yet?" is not worth the ride nor the price of admission. Too bad for Ice Cube though. He is a winning presence with an appealing deadpan comic shtick in the "Friday",and "Barbershop" movies as well as here,but he is hampered by the subpar work of the writers who are totally responsible for this mayhem of family dysfunctional values. Here he is not only muggin the camera at its worst,it is also the most pathetic display of sympathy by a actor in recent months. Here is what the producers did here. First they bring on two of the stars from the first original "Friday" movie(Ice Cube and a suddenly aged Nia Long),and put them in a film that is supposed to be family oriented material,since the film uses every cliché from several films to bring this to the point of ridiculous mayhem. From there,they bring on two of the most misbehaving,obnoxious kids ever to sully the screen,exhibiting misbehavior to such an extreme that it goes beyond the point of normality which to say goes way beneath rude and disrespectful. Still it is a shame that Ice Cube chose this clunker of a vehicle for his first-ever family film. It could have been a whole lot better if Cube brought along his protégé from the first "Friday" film as one of the kids uncles,you know like Chris Tucker? It could have made this film a lot more entertaining.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30987,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-05-25","keywords":"braces,fish out of water,child gagged,reference to lebron james,reference to 50 cent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Are We There Yet?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991704857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000505/","name":"Nia Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020248/","name":"Aleisha Allen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505152/","name":"Brian Levant"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044714/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027958/","name":"Steven Gary Banks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257282/","name":"Claudia Grazioso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

Check out 'The Experts,' a cold-war influenced, pre-Truman Show comedy that was a good idea, but should've developed into something more.\n\nThis is the story of KGB agents who have developed an isolated town which will emulate a sleepy Midwestern American town. The purpose is to fully assimilate it's agents into American culture so that they may go undetected when they infiltrate the states (although some of the residents had been there their whole lives and seemed unlikely of doing anything in the actual America for which it serves as a template). But, sensing that the training ground is out-of-touch with modern America, one of the executives of the agency hires to bumbling New Yorkers to be their guide to what's hip in 1989 America. They lure them to the town under the guise that they're developing a night club and want those two to advise them.\n\nUnaware of what is going on, their "experts" stick out like a sore thumb in the 50's Midwest style neighborhood, before others catch on and emulate the two newcomers' love of dirty dancing, club music, and mass materialism of electronic consumer goods in the same way that the modern teenagers in Pleasantville effected their surroundings. Only, the other agents disapprove of the changes in their people who seem wholly unaware of their artificial surroundings (much like "the experts") and don't want the Experts to stay. Meanwhile, it is only a matter of time before the Experts figure out what is really going on as they tend to rub some of the higher-up executives the wrong way with their presence.\n\nThe idea was fun, and deserved a lot more quirkiness and less family-friendly appeal in order to make one of those really funky late 80s comedies that celebrate that modern American city culture. The movie, however, by mid-state tends to drag on in repetition and by the end, becomes completely balled up in corniness as the town becomes chaotic and the filmmakers struggle for a perfect resolution in which American culture prevails over the perceived stuffiness of then-Communist Russia. It is instead a more moderate comedy with some funny moments, but overall is more or less droll. Not that hilarious, not that different. But there is some appeal, especially if you're searching out lost titles of the 80s, no matter how mild they may be.\n\nWorth a shot, if for nothing else, than to see Arye Gross and John Travolta in ridiculous 80s garb.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2444,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1989-01-13","keywords":"spy,1980s,soviet union,renovation,american in russia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi341360153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjUyNzdlOGMtYWYzNC00Y2Y3LWI0ZWItN2VmYzgwNTM2ZmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjUyNzdlOGMtYWYzNC00Y2Y3LWI0ZWItN2VmYzgwNTM2ZmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343325/","name":"Arye Gross"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000593/","name":"Kelly Preston"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0858686/","name":"Dave Thomas"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338932/","name":"Steven Greene"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0022737/","name":"Eric Alter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857904/","name":"Nick Thiel"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You can give your opinion and say what you enjoyed or didn't enjoy but I find myself hesitating in certain aspects just because a classic must be left some space to be a classic. Ghost as far as I'm concerned will forever be a romantic classic. It's sheer brilliance is it's twists, it is incredibly, deeply, romantic and at the same time terrifying, and has an underlying story that is never fully explored. It's got action, mystery, horror, and at the heart is the pure, simplistic romance of it all.\n\nThe story is about an investment banker played by Patrick Swayze and his girlfriend, played by Demi Moore. Sam and Molly are deeply in love, planning for the future and happier in their lives than ever before. Until Sam discovers laundered money in investment accounts. He is robbed and subsequently murdered for his password to the computer in order to empty the laundered money from the accounts. But Sam doesn't go the other side. He is kept on earth in spirit form because of his unfinished business both with Molly and to discover his murderer. He must learn the ropes of being a ghost and nobody else can hear him until he runs into a so called psychic who scams people into believing she can contact their dearly departed. However it turns out, Oda Mae Brown played in her academy award winning role by Whoopie Goldberg can actually hear Sam. Together the unlikely team must help each other uncover the horrible murder plot and save Molly.\n\nSwayze and Moore make an incredible couple..hot on screen. Their careers have perhaps slipped since then one might say but this was them at their best. Swayze was indeed at the top of his game coming out of Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse and Moore was young and a new hot commodity which made them undeniably perfect together. Their roles fit them perfectly. Whoopie Goldberg was hilarious and believable as Oda Mae and her character was such an integral part of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays a great villain as the betrayer of the film. In a short time director Jerry Zucker establishes a best friendship between Goldwyn and Swayze, a deeply loving relationship between Swayze and Moore, and a plot line that goes far beneath the movie. Obviously Goldwyn's character is being used by a much higher up criminal to launder money although we never see him. Is he being blackmailed? Paid off? Something held over his head? Maybe he's not the bad guy but rather forced to commit these acts? It's a big job because we also know Willie Lopez played by Rick Aviles is involved in this as well. And deeper than that we have the theology in the film. The light brings good people to the afterlife and the dark shadowy beings torture the evil. \n\nThis film is one of a few that is endlessly watchable meaning you can sit down any time and watch it through over and over and over again which is exactly what makes it a classic. It has it's holes, it has to with a plot like that. And it has it's disturbing moments, a gratituous death scene, a make out scene which although features Swayze and Moore is actually Demi and Whoopi...you have to see it to understand it. Also if Sam Wheat must learn how to physically touch things in his ghost form...how does he sit, walk, etc before he learns that? And his first experience with walking through a door happens days after his death. I'm sure sometime between then and that point he would have had to have walked through something. Perhaps those are minor points but they are things that will come up especially if you have seen it as many times as I have. \n\nThe film is a must see and if you haven't seen it, go watch it right now!!

The action twists and turns, the characters may or may not be what they seem to be, and crosses follow double-crosses. Thus, there is little time for the viewer to be bored or to ponder the implausibility of it all. But, in a sleek glossy film such as this one, logic is not a key factor, it's the look and the action that count, and both of those attributes, especially the look, make "Entrapment" an entertaining film. Sean Connery, who plays an aging master thief, can anchor any film that he appears in, and this one is no exception. His presence alone grounds the movie and nearly makes the implausible plausible. However, while Connery is one of a handful of men who have retained their looks and masculine appeal beyond middle age, the likelihood that the luscious Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is at the peak of her beauty here, would fall for him tests the bounds of credibility. Perhaps the romance was written in as a fantasy for us near-codgers and to give us hope. Besides the excellent cinematography of the human scenery, which also includes the dependable Will Patton and Ving Rhames, the lush photography of the Scottish Highlands offers an unsolicited advertisement for the Scottish National Tourist Board. If rooms were available in the luxurious castle that Connery uses in the film, this would have been written there.\n\nThus, "Entrapment" seems to have everything: beautiful people, solid performances, breathtaking scenery, suspense, and excitement. There is definitely enough here to entertain a not-too-discriminating viewer for two hours. Of course, afterward, one might ponder why all of the expensive high-tech security systems that are depicted in the film quickly fall victim to a pair of thieves who seem more amused with themselves than intense and focused when they are stealing such incredible sums of money. If theft were as easy and casual as Connery and Zeta-Jones make it seem to be, we could all have a lot more fun in life plotting and executing heists instead of commuting and staring at computer monitors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112016,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"1999-04-30","keywords":"art,art thief,master thief,sexual tension,heist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Entrapment","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1789198617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ1NzA2OWUtZDc3OC00OGM1LWFmZTAtNmM2NzEyYTA0Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ1NzA2OWUtZDc3OC00OGM1LWFmZTAtNmM2NzEyYTA0Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000750/","name":"Jon Amiel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103746/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0060103/","name":"Ronald Bass"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381110/","name":"Michael Hertzberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115310/","name":"William Broyles Jr."}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

David Giuntoli and Danny Bruno are AWESOME!!!!!!! The special effects are amazing. We like the autopsy scenes too even though pretty gruesome! It's way cool! I hope that NBC does the smart thing and keeps this one going... It's certainly a HIT in our house.

Even though Leigh Whannel (spelling might be wrong) Doesn't act that well, you can see his fear, along with everyone else's. Not the most gruesome of the series. The twist at the end is one you didn't know to begin with but then you're like "omg totally makes sense now". This series is a fun one to watch, all the blood and gore. It is a classic among horror films.

So they do the logical thing--drop her off in front of the hospital and escape. Back at home they come up with a story. One of them borrows another's car and tries to escape from something chasing him. He crashes but manages to make a video before he dies.\n\nA year later all the kids start getting texts from the injured girl who is actually in a coma. They go the hospital. There we learn of a stain on the ceiling and flies. One of the kids who's gone missing reappears and shows them the video of the dead guy where things are explained. So it turns out that guy was cursed and the only way to pass on the curse is buy getting someone else killed. Because they were all part of the prank now they are cursed and have this night, the night before Halloween to make someone else die or they will die.\n\nThe police are sort of after them and so is the curse--a bunch of flies that can take on the shape of a creature or of weapons. Of course the kids will have different ways of dealing with this, some will be fine with trying to get someone else killed others reject the idea and will try to figure out some other way out.\n\nThe Night Before Halloween is a surprisingly good production for a Syfy movie. Unfortunately only the production is good. Everything else isn't. In particular the story, which would be more suited for a short. The problem is that all we focus on is these unremarkable kids we can't even care about. It's actually a relief to see some adults, in the form of the cops. It's also Anthony Lemke who in the role of the main detective gives the most convincing performance. Surprisingly, this movie is all business. There's not much of an attempt at romance, or comedy or anything else for that matter. The problem is that the business of this movie just doesn't convince. It would have helped if the curse didn't come in the utterly unscary form of flies. The idea itself of a curse that has to be resolved in 24 hours isn't a bad idea nor is it new. More should have been done with the idea if an additional writer would have been hired. Granted, this is a pretty bland movie for teens and about teens, I'm not sure though even teens would enjoy this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":570,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3},"genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-10-29","keywords":"mischief night,curse,coma,fly,halloween prank","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1933128/","name":"Bailee Madison"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2683203/","name":"Justin Kelly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3457380/","name":"Jahmil French"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934135/","name":"Sheldon Wilson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0498613/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0541691/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934135/","name":"Sheldon Wilson"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Our Family LOVES this show! The way the writers mix the Grimm's Fairy tales into present day plots are very interesting. Seeing Portland,Oregon in all it's beauty and lushness is quite breathtaking. We especially liked the refrigerator repair man on "Danse Macabre". Of course Monroe is always fun. Kate Burton was a wonderful surprise on the pilot episode.

By S4 mid-point, its turned into the most dreadful, ham-acted, soap opera where the artifact mysteries are largely overwhelmed by the childish acting - especially Pete who appears to have gone from being slightly immature macho man to an emotional 7yrs old.

This is how the poet Julian Przybos described Dabrowska's linguistic contribution.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1975-09-23","keywords":"countryside,world war one,complaining,family saga,based on novel","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053019/","name":"Jadwiga Baranska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082761/","name":"Jerzy Binczycki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0118829/","name":"Emir Buczacki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025778/","name":"Jerzy Antczak"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016599/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025778/","name":"Jerzy Antczak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196448/","name":"Maria Dabrowska"],"duration":"PT4H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
