S. society, American values, white America, etc. Every story throws new shade on the FBI and/or the USA as a nation, or American culture.\n\nI have never seen any of the FBI agents say, "Wow that guy was just plain evil," unless it was a white Anglo who was (always) a racist, Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, etc. The message of this show is that white people are evil, and everyone else, including the criminals, are victims of "White America." I am not white, and I find this show incredibly disturbing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is just a generic movie and a pretty decent generic movie at that.  Lets face it, every plot is based on clichés. What counts is how these clichés are used.  The screenwriter's challenge is this: Can he blow enough smoke and juggle his mirrors in such a way as to make the viewer believe he is seeing something new or, at least, enjoy the same old crap?  Shakespeare did it.  Dickens did it.  Stephen King has made a career out of it.  The problem with Along Came a Spider is that no-frills clichés are all you get, basic and unadorned. The movie's ad campaign should have featured bare white posters, a bar code and the word `Thriller' printed in the middle. Okay, I overstate.  You do get Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Mr. Freeman has never given a bad performance and doesn't start with this film.  Mr. Wincott is also very, very good. He makes you feel a little sorry for his character despite his murderous escapades. You rather want to comfort him when the inevitable problems start cropping up.\n\nTo make sure you are getting your moneys worth, the writers have thrown in a `Guaranteed Surprise Ending". Now some movies sport twist endings that are knockouts.  These endings not only come as genuine surprises and are completely satisfying; they force you to reconsider everything that went before in the film.  Think of The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects or The Crying Game. First, in all these movies the ending was prepared for.  No matter how unexpected ultimately the twists make sense in the terms of the logic of the movie.  Second, you recognize these movies as superior long before you reach the conclusion.  Had The Sixth Sense ended five minutes before it did you still would have remembered the performances, the genuinely scary moments and the fantastic plot.  The twist came as icing on an already fine cake. Along Came A Spider has a surprise ending because, well, 'Thrillers' have `Surprise Endings'.  That's all.  You probably won't guess it, but even so you won't be all that surprised.  You will realize that since because such and such happens, the movie can only end in two or three different ways. Like the rest of the movie the twist is mechanical and non-descript.  It's satisfying enough but it operates more as a punctuation mark than anything else.\n\nThis sounds like a pretty negative review - and I guess it is.  In fairness I should say I enjoyed myself watching it.  A predictable experience is not necessarily a bad experience.  Sometimes all you want is a no frills `Thriller'.  You have a taste in your mouth for guns and psychopaths and you've already seen Hannibal, so what do you do?  Sure, a movie that sautés it's clichés with a bit more sauce and spice would be preferable, but if your only other option is a Matlock rerun, Along Came A Spider looks pretty darn good!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":79749,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You have a taste in your mouth for guns and psychopaths and you've already seen Hannibal, so what do you do?  Sure, a movie that sautés it's clichés with a bit more sauce and spice would be preferable, but if your only other option is a Matlock rerun, Along Came A Spider looks pretty darn good!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":79749,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If the producers want to use the original theme song, then why shorten it? It reminded me of the truncated TV tunes of re-runs in syndication.\n\nNow for the pilot episode. I thought it odd that Hawaii 5-0 would open with a scene in South Korea. It's like stumbling out of bed in the morning not exactly sure what you're going to do that day.\n\nThere are also seemed to be to much gun play and not enough acting. The dialog and some of the background setup (Danno's family situation, for example) was a bit too cliché. Some of the personal background could be better developed over time rather than cramming it into one episode while chasing the bad guys.\n\nThe overall storyline for the pilot was excellent, though. It gave background to 5-0's beginnings and it maintained a certain consistency and plausibility with TOS while adding the dimension of McGarrett and his father.\n\nSome of the dialog resulted in an approving chuckle from me.\n\nThe episode began to gel about 2/3 in and by the end of the show, I felt comfortable with the main characters and looked forward to the next chapter.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After years of watching Colt drive through a china shop with his truck, use the trailer part of the truck which is used to move cars as a ramp, use a a rocket pack and hang onto the side of a chopper. All in a hour show! This show raised the bar high.  My wife hates Heather Thomas. and says she's there for her anatomy, with her lines "Colt he's got a gun or "Oh Colt."  Howie was funny, and added good comedy.  The Unknown stunt man theme was great.  I loved the time some thugs beat up an identical truck to Colt's and he drives off with the real one and these 2 huge guys leaving the bar say,  "hey what did you to my truck."  Speaking of trucks I think that truck must have started the SUV craze, with the imprint it left on many 30 and 40 year olds minds. I love the Mad comic spoof on this show.  A must watch.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6836,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All in a hour show! This show raised the bar high.  My wife hates Heather Thomas. and says she's there for her anatomy, with her lines "Colt he's got a gun or "Oh Colt."  Howie was funny, and added good comedy.  The Unknown stunt man theme was great.  I loved the time some thugs beat up an identical truck to Colt's and he drives off with the real one and these 2 huge guys leaving the bar say,  "hey what did you to my truck."  Speaking of trucks I think that truck must have started the SUV craze, with the imprint it left on many 30 and 40 year olds minds. I love the Mad comic spoof on this show.  A must watch.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6836,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Someone with no experience of plot and dialogue could have done a better job, it is dreadful. Spent the whole film waiting for someone to mimic Tony Curtis and say...'Yonder lies de castle of my fodder'. The best part was watching Ron Perlman finally cut through the crap, drop the pretence of being a medieval knight in this dire waste of studio money - and headbutt the demon. True Ron and what we love him for! Do not waste your time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91317,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The lure of the California sunshine, the city's aggressive takeover of commercial sex properties in Times Square and the devastating impact of the AIDS epidemic mark the end of an era. With the party of the 1970s winding down, 42nd Street has deteriorated into a hive of uncontrolled violent crime and seedy video stores, making urban renewal seem more unlikely than ever before.","datePublished":"2017-08-25","description":"A look at life in New York City during the 1970s and '80s when porn and prostitution were rampant in Manhattan.","keywords":"sex abuser,porn director,female nudity,bare breasts,bare butt","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt4998350/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"rf-38867","dateCreated":"2017-09-11","inLanguage":"English","name":"Spooky 70s realism.","reviewBody":"Unlike Barbara Billingsly in "Airplane!"

The do or die of series like this is character development so it takes more than one episode to see that.The first episode of GoT gave you no clue as to what was in store. Jaimie Lannister alone took several seasons to fully develop. The one thing you do see is the amazing sets and scenes that teleport you back to 1971. Where did they get so many huge smog belching American cars? The panoramic shots of NY streets had to cost a truckload of money. If the actual storyline comes close to the effort put into the visuals we might be in for a wild ride.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25989,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I don't get how some reviews can be this bad for a season that has yet to come to an end. So far, for me, this has been enjoyable to watch. It resembles the movie Fallen with Denzel Washington. If you saw and/or liked that movie, how fair would it have been to review it without having seen the last 30 minutes? Yes, this is a slow burn, but the acting and suspense carry it. If a small amount of your mind cannot think outside the box, which is actually something that some of the characters go through during the show, then I guess you shouldn't watch this. But, it's Stephen King! Knowing that, you should expect an element of weirdness. I guess some people can't handle that. But, if you can open your mind a little bit and commit to it, this is definitely worth the watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68718,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The acting is great and I think Alex Nesic will be one of our sexiest men in the future. Now I must note that the first show had an error that was quite blatant to me. The penitentiary in Lompoc, California is where I used to live. It is not pronounced "Lompak", but is pronounced "Lompoke". I was surprised that was not noticed and corrected. Also I wonder how Darwin gets by with carrying and using his cell phone w/o question? That I find confusing. I would think the leader would get that phone and check the calls just to keep a good check on the members. Other than that, I look forward to the episodes. Can someone tell me what nights this will be on and what channel? thanks.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6026,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I always rolled my eyes at all the "lonely" and "depressed" singles on Valentine's Day that would gripe about spending the day eating their hearts out or spending time in solidarity. Some people don't have mothers on Mother's Day, fathers on Father's Day, or grandparents on Grandparents Day, and you really want to blog about your issues with being single on a contrived day where elements of marketing and guilt dominate? Spare me.\n\nThe (Dead Mothers) Club is a documentary that will make you grateful to have your mother in your life or comforted through relatability by people who share your position if you don't. Despite headlining familiar names such as Jane Fonda, Rosie O'Donnell, and Molly Shannon, celebrities whose mothers died when they were all young, the film sets its main focus on common-people, one ready for college, another raising her young child, who have experienced tragedy with the lack of a female parental force to care for them.\n\nOne of the girls is Leticia, a clearly strong woman, whose mother died from a rare genetic mutation. Leticia is in the middle of raising a very young daughter when a test finds that she also had the rare mutation and that the flawed gene has spread throughout every cell in her body. She now has to put up the same fight her mother did and lost. Another girl we center on is Ginger, a wise, artistic young woman, who loves reflecting on her mother's personality and sensibilities. Her mother always worried because she was an art student that she'd never get the work she truly deserved. Ginger has found great success at painting and crafting stacking dolls and uses that as her means of income.\n\nFinally, there's Jordyn, who is ready to enter college. A smart, beautiful young woman, she is definitely one of the most precocious teenage girls I've seen in a while, moved by legacy and persistency rather than impulsive behavior. She struggles to make the right decision about college without her mother's input.\n\nFonda, O'Donnell, and Shannon pop up every now and then to talk about their mother's impact and how their death affected them. Fonda's mom killed herself when she was twelve, and Fonda lived with that grief until she was sixty-four, when she realized it wasn't her fault after all. O'Donnell's mom died when she was ten, while Shannon's died in a car accident when she was only four.\n\nDirectresses Katie Green and Carlye Rubin refrain from milking sentimentality out of these stories, which is an element I've seen thankfully lacking in HBO documentaries. Despite films that bear titles and topics (IE: grief camps for children and a veteran in prison for life embracing his final days to name a few) that almost instantly make one tear up, these documentaries nicely avoid the sappier elements and exploiting certain situations emotionally.\n\nIt's often that I casually fault HBO's short documentaries for not being long enough and stating that many of them could easily be of feature length; The (Dead Mothers) Club, which runs at seventy minutes, give or take, could've easily been just as successful in its message with about thirty minutes trimmed off. The film begins to run circles around its ideas, and while we learn about the stories of the film's main characters, there's not much else we can say other than these are fine young women who are growing up without mothers and are likely going to make interesting, well-developed people. What about the young males who lack the female sensitivity and guidance in their lives? What about those who have become emotionally troubled without their mother in their life? \n\nIf The (Dead Mothers) Club had to be seventy minutes in length, horizons could've been broadened and alternate routes could've been taken to give more thematic resonance to these stories other than having the audience recognize that they are indeed unfortunate. However, because it takes a necessary topic and fuels it was material and substance that isn't directly geared to exploit its subjects and the sentiment at hand, (and, in turn, winds up being very personal and often moving) the film does possess considerable merit.\n\nNOTE: The (Dead Mothers) Club will air throughout the month of May 2014 on HBO.\n\nStarring: Jane Fonda, Rosie O'Donnell, and Molly Shannon.

There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this "cesspool of vice" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by "the code of honour", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. \n\nAs far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today – and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in "SWEAR-engen" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in – and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them – are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of "all-time great bad-asses".\n\nSo my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a "sanitized version" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle. Great, intelligent and informative entertainment. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Smiling maybe twice, groaning several times, rolling my eyes several more, and eventually closing them for a few seconds trying to imagine what a movie like this could've been if the quality of the talent matched the quality of the three screenwriters behind this project.\n\nThe first Grown Ups film wasn't great - or even good - by any means, but had the vibe of a cheery, stupid ABC Family movie. The strongest complaint I had about the original film carries over to this one immensely which is that given the immense amount of talent in this film, from the three title characters alone, this should be a much better, much funnier movie. Adam Sandler can be funny when he is given timing and a decent character, Kevin James can always be sweet, simple, and relatable, Chris Rock is one of the funniest comedians working today, and David Spade almost always knocks one out of the park in Rules of Engagement. It's dumbfounding to note that Taylor Lautner has the biggest laughs in the film, and after watching this, I have faith that after the redundant Twilight franchise he'll find work in some solid buddy comedies. However, the first inkling that Grown Ups 2 is terrible is by the sole fact that Rob Schneider himself decided other matters were worth is time than making a film that was almost guaranteed to be a hit.\n\nThe entire event is a plot less picture (not the good kind) that provides its audience with a pathetic array of scenes that seem more like throwaway skits from Saturday Night Live. It's a massively redundant, laundry-list of senseless setups with unfunny payoffs that usually involve something along the lines of bathroom humor, objectification, homophobia, and obnoxious behavior. In other words, it's another Sandler movie. It takes place entirely on the last day of school and revolves around the gang of Lenny (Adam Sandler), Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), and Marcus (David Spade) returns, this time welcoming a more quiet, suburban lifestyle contrary to that of Lenny's in Hollywood, and the ridiculous series of sitcom antics that unfold overtime.\n\nThe plot stops there. What follows is, as stated, a series of cheaply-staged, poorly-performed, witless gags that do nothing but make one check the time. Among the barrage of questions I had while watching this film, one of which was, "who is the target audience here?" My mind resorted immediately to tweens and adolescents, who spend too much time giggling at bathroom humor as is. But then, as the film progressed, it began to redirect its senses to a more sentimental side, which only shows the immense tonal strain the film has which is "create cinematic anarchy for forty minutes before showing that this is a story about being true to ones roots and taking care of the family." The sentimentalism is then mixed with a strangely out of place eighties party that concludes the picture, which will definitely not be appreciated to the fullest extent by the previously mentioned tweens and adolescences, as many of the jokes and period references will fly straight over their head.\n\nThe problem with the film is that it seems so effortless and so poorly conducted. At least with various Sandler films like Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and even the unexpectedly raunchy That's My Boy, I could sense that it was made for somebody, be it adolescents or a bit older of a crowd and stuck with that persona. Grown Ups 2 is a film made with no agenda, no personality, and no spirit. It even resorts to the tireless Sandler cliché of having all the male characters being a cornucopia of stupidity and the female characters being nothing but eye-candy for the men. There are certain things I expect Sandler to be over now, what with approaching fifty in a few years.\n\nYou have a choice as a moviegoer this weekend and the several other weekends Grown Ups 2 is going to play. You can either a see a film that possesses gags as commonplace and predictable as a Fruity Pebbles commercial or use this time as an opportunity to seek out nearby independent features in theaters, at your local video store, or even on Netflix. Say you refute that suggestion and want to see Grown Ups 2 as a pleasant, feel-good movie. I know plenty of independent movies that are pleasant, feel good movies (Frances Ha is one of them and is still playing in many theaters nationwide). Wouldn't you at least want to give money to people who don't believe that you're sitting in the audience because you possess the attention-span of a newborn?

The film features a relatively simple but clever premise: Superhottie Kylie Travis stars as Karen Warren, a police negotiator who's on vacation in Texas. She gets into a car accident and has to hitchhike with a somewhat odd, but seemingly friendly couple, Frank and Rayanne (James Belushi and Shannon Whirry). \n\nBut everything goes horribly wrong when Frank discovers Rayanne has been cheating on him and he murders her right in front of Karen's eyes, who proceeds to run to the nearest building, a government-owned complex run by a single occupant, a scientist named Brian (Frank Whaley). There, he accidentally activates the time travel device he was working on, sending Karen back twenty minutes, just as she's been picked up by Frank. She then becomes determined to stop the horrible crime for occurring, but unfortunately, the body count grows even larger and she must go back again to prevent an even larger massacre.\n\nRetroactive's appeal holds mainly to sci-fi action fans. The plot has a lot of twists and turns, which keeps the film unpredictable and suspenseful. But the real treat is for action fans, who should strap in for an adrenaline-pumping thrill ride. From the moment Travis is sent back in time, the film deliver non-stop excitement. There are tense shootouts and fast-paced car chases, the latter of which boasts some of the most exhilarating stunts since The Road Warrior. From a visceral point-of-view, Retroactive surpasses most of Hollywood's recent summer blockbusters. \n\nThe film still has its flaws, none of them surprisingly having to do with a sense of repetition, considering each action setpiece has the same basic setting and situation (car chase on a lonely desert highway, shootout at a gas station). Credit director Louis Morneau for keeping each sequence fresh and taut with suspense. The set-up may be the same, but the results and resolutions considerably differ. Rather, what I do have a problem with is some technical error during the shootouts. Belushi is shown firing a six-bullet revolver at one point, but clearly fires more than ten rounds. Another similar blatant miscalculation occurs again near the end. Plot holes and leaps of logic are expected in this kind of film, but the number of shots fired from a gun shouldn't be that hard to keep track of.\n\nAs the film's tough heroine, the absolutely gorgeous Kylie Travis is refreshingly intelligent and strong-willed. She occasionally has trouble holding back that British accent of hers, but still comes across quite well (looks great in that black tank-top, too). James Belushi is a lot of fun as the psychotic villain, clearly relishing the over-the-top role, even though his character does lose menace through some ridiculous one-liners. Frank Whaley is quite good as the young scientist, hampered only by a single scene that requires him to forget the logic of his own device which Travis corrects him on.\n\nWith blistering, fast-paced action and a fun story, Retroactive proves to be a highly enjoyable way to spend ninety minutes. Most of the running time features a tight tank-top and pants wearing Kylie Travis kicking ass, so that alone is enough to recommend the film."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both this film and Michael Bay's "The Rock" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.\n\nBut as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":402115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both this film and Michael Bay's "The Rock" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.\n\nBut as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":402115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Skiptrace, Railroad Tigers, and Kung Fu Yoga ALL FELT LIKE RUSHED HALF ASSED MOVIES...\n\nI don't know what Jackie Chan is thinking... Before around 2010 and below it felt like his movies were perfect, no rush but now since after that it's almost like he's just pumping out movies just for the money and little to no care is gone into them...\n\nJackie you are from the golden age of cinema, DO NOT ADAPT the CGI, I say just go back to how you used to make movies in the 80's and 90's EVEN THOUGH you can't do the stunts you used to be able to do just use doubles when necessary... YOU CAN STILL DO YOUR FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY, there is nothing stopping you from doing that, people just want to see you doing your stuff and you have a lot to offer just in hand to hand choreography anyway that does not require CGI or any doubles!\n\nBut what the hell do I know?

YOU CAN STILL DO YOUR FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY, there is nothing stopping you from doing that, people just want to see you doing your stuff and you have a lot to offer just in hand to hand choreography anyway that does not require CGI or any doubles!\n\nBut what the hell do I know?

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL \n\nWarner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book "super-hero", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close Let's try to keep things in perspective, O.K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS! \n\n10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! \n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1338494,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lucy (George Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace (Will Poucher) where they meet up with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader . Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarfs, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world .

The pic is a magic story with rip-snorting adventures , exciting fantasy , state-of-art FX , sensational scenarios and good feeling . Plenty of action and emotion with incredible sea battle scenes and really influenced by ¨Pirates of Caribbean¨ . Provide enough amusement to keep the hands on your seat and dazzling eyes until the epic ending . In spite of overlong runtime and the difficult of adapting , the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the fantastic saga . Sympathetic performances for all casting with special mention to Will Poucher who steals the show as a grumpy kid turned into incredible hero . The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Dante Spinotti . Musical score fitting perfectly to action-adventure by David Arnold . The motion picture is marvelously directed by Michael Apted , he's director, producer of several successes such as ¨The word is not enough¨, ¨Gorillas in the mist¨ , ¨Class action¨, ¨Nell¨, ¨Enigma¨ , among others .

Overall this is a really nice movie . If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with overwhelming CGI animation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145267,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Return to magic ,return to hope , return to Narnia. Some journeys take us far from home . Some adventures lead us to our destiny . It begins during German air raids over London in WWII . Three kids travel through a picture to the land of Narnia and learn of their destiny to free it and help Prince Caspian . Lucy (George Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace (Will Poucher) where they meet up with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader . Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarfs, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world . Then, all of them go throughout the fantastic world and where animals speaking as a likable giant swords-rat , a bull and many others . It has been foretold that they will bring peace to Narnia with the guidance of the mystical lion . They must survive the evil treachery of the mysterious White Witch (Tilda Swinton) who still claims to be Queen . They team up with Aslem (Liam Neeson), the mighty Lion , fighting to defeat the evil in an epic finale battle against a huge sea monster .\n\nIn this impressive production , C.S. Lewis' imagination is brought to life with top-notch computer generator special effects . It packs amazing fantasy , breathtaking adventures and overwhelming sea battles . This enjoyable story is lavishly produced by Andrew Adamson from ¨Shrek trilogy¨ and Mark Johnson . The pic is a magic story with rip-snorting adventures , exciting fantasy , state-of-art FX , sensational scenarios and good feeling . Plenty of action and emotion with incredible sea battle scenes and really influenced by ¨Pirates of Caribbean¨ . Provide enough amusement to keep the hands on your seat and dazzling eyes until the epic ending . In spite of overlong runtime and the difficult of adapting , the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the fantastic saga . Sympathetic performances for all casting with special mention to Will Poucher who steals the show as a grumpy kid turned into incredible hero . The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Dante Spinotti . Musical score fitting perfectly to action-adventure by David Arnold . The motion picture is marvelously directed by Michael Apted , he's director, producer of several successes such as ¨The word is not enough¨, ¨Gorillas in the mist¨ , ¨Class action¨, ¨Nell¨, ¨Enigma¨ , among others . Rating : Above average and worthwhile seeing , the whole family will enjoy this film . It's a very likable adventure-fantasy and enormously appealing for kids, adolescents and young men . Overall this is a really nice movie . If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with overwhelming CGI animation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145267,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The fourth-grader left behind her bosom buddies back in Iowa, and her family is relocating in the wake of her grandfather's passing.\n\nIntent on starting out on the right foot, Chrissa (Sammi Hanratty) promptly runs afoul of a clutch of Alpha Female bullies who pile on the abuse and push the hapless newcomer to the brink of dropping out in favor of home-schooling. But with a little help from her wise grandmother and a perceptive art teacher (Jennifer Tilly), she learns to stare down her adversaries, claim her place as a member of the student body, and provide a role model for bullying victims of all stripes. \n\n"American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong" is a thoroughly earnest drama that squeezes the protagonist through a painful gamut of pre-adolescent conflicts, engineered primarily by Tara, the bully in chief played with wicked relish by the very capable Adair Tishler. \n\nYoung viewers will have little problem soaking up every drop of pathos projected by Miss Hanratty and by an even more sympathetic co-victim, a little homeless girl played to the hilt by Kaitlyn Dever.\n\nJust a few things worth pointing out: Dealing with the subject of bullying apparently prompted the decision here not to make light of anything. Thus, the main problem with "Chrissa" is that there are almost no light moments. Good story-tellers know that humor is one of the best ways to relieve tension for viewers. Other than a spitting llama and a quirky characterization by the trouper Miss Tilly, there's not much to chuckle about in this movie. Miss Hanratty is convincing in various degrees of angst, but the movie may leave youngsters a bit exhausted by the time the theme is realized on camera: that is, standing up to bullies opens the door to friendship. \n\nAnother problem is the puzzling lack of motivation shown for Tara. Apparently she is insecure but we don't get much insight into what drives her to be Mean Girl No. 1 in this classroom. But then, maybe an exceptionally pretty, somewhat haughty little girl doesn't need any other reason to be mean. \n\nAs with other movies in the "American Girl" series, the subtext is in product placement. Here, it's a fashion show of contemporary looks. The cast is costumed in closets full of attractive dresses, sweaters, skirts, tops, headbands, swimwear  not to mention tights in a rainbow of colors.\n\nThis movie will no doubt give many young viewers a lot of exciting ideas for the next time they go shopping for their dolls and themselves.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":921,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Here, it's a fashion show of contemporary looks. The cast is costumed in closets full of attractive dresses, sweaters, skirts, tops, headbands, swimwear  not to mention tights in a rainbow of colors.\n\nThis movie will no doubt give many young viewers a lot of exciting ideas for the next time they go shopping for their dolls and themselves.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":921,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Its a blatant rip-off of Doctor Doolittle. Is Hollywood running out of ideas? Its a nice way to spend 90 minutes but thats about it. I was thinking about John Candy watching this film and I think this is a role he could have played and played better then Kevin James did, the role of a lovable, bumbling guy who redeems himself in the end. I guess people who make these talking animal movies think its "cute" to have celebrities do the animal voices. They have Cher, Nick Nolte and Sylvester Stallone here. Bernie the talking gorilla has got to be the funniest on screen simian since Clyde in Every Which Way But Loose.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58443,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'll try my best to be objective in this review, though. The plot is good, and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced(well, for a Jim Carrey comedy, anyway); I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good; Jim Carrey is in his element, so it's no surprise that he's good, but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English, not American, and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent(Robin Hood: Men in Tights), I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, partly because it's, well, Carrey, but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles, this is fairly "clean", so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great; I mean, we all know that we lie several times a day(heck, it's even been scientifically proved), but what about if we, for one whole day, couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme, provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film, though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The romance of Annie Potts' Janine and Rick Moranis' Louis is funny, but there is no explanation of what happened with her romance with Egon from the first one.  A lot of the story and humor is recycled from the original, but fans of the first film will definitely enjoy this above-average sequel.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When I saw previews for "Loser", I was expecting a comedy with a spritz of romance and a dash of drama for good measure.  Instead I got a hopeless mess which wasn't sure what it wanted to be.\n\nA college frosh (Jason Biggs, from American Pie) is ridiculed by his three dorm buddies, who love to host wild parties and slip roofies into drinks of the ladies.  They eventually kick him out of the room, leaving him to fend for himself.  At the same time, he falls for a down-and-out classmate (Mena Suvari, of American Pie and American Beauty) who has the hots for her rude &amp; crude teacher.  In theory, it sounds great.  In reality, it's a lot harder to pull off.\n\nThere aren't that many chuckles, and most of them revolve around Bigg's ability to screw up and get laughed at.  After a while, you stop thinking he's a geek and actually start to think he's not such a bad guy after all, and why can't something else happen besides him getting made fun of?  And why's Suvari still with this teacher for a nerve-wracking hour and a half when it's OBVIOUS the guy's a creep?  Basically, Biggs chases Suvari around for 120 minutes trying to convince her to go for him because he's such a nice guy (which is true, but you'd think the girl would catch on quicker).\n\nAdd to the mix three moronic dorm buddies who don't even resemble real people (or real college kids, for that matter; all three look to be around 25-30).  The only part of the movie I did like was the ending, when an "update" scrolled onto the screen to tell the future fates of these three idiots.  I chuckled at that part.  If only there was more to chuckle about.\n\nIt looks like Amy Heckerling tried really hard to pull this off, but I don't think it's really her fault.  After all, to direct and produce a really wonderful film, one has to have a wonderful script to start from. I don't think she had a chance.\n\nIf you want a fantastic school comedy, do yourself a favor; Save the $8.50 and go rent "Clueless".  So it deals with high school instead of college... it's still better."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26822,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When I saw previews for "Loser", I was expecting a comedy with a spritz of romance and a dash of drama for good measure.  Instead I got a hopeless mess which wasn't sure what it wanted to be.\n\nA college frosh (Jason Biggs, from American Pie) is ridiculed by his three dorm buddies, who love to host wild parties and slip roofies into drinks of the ladies.  They eventually kick him out of the room, leaving him to fend for himself.  At the same time, he falls for a down-and-out classmate (Mena Suvari, of American Pie and American Beauty) who has the hots for her rude &amp; crude teacher.  In theory, it sounds great.  In reality, it's a lot harder to pull off.\n\nThere aren't that many chuckles, and most of them revolve around Bigg's ability to screw up and get laughed at.  After a while, you stop thinking he's a geek and actually start to think he's not such a bad guy after all, and why can't something else happen besides him getting made fun of?  And why's Suvari still with this teacher for a nerve-wracking hour and a half when it's OBVIOUS the guy's a creep?  Basically, Biggs chases Suvari around for 120 minutes trying to convince her to go for him because he's such a nice guy (which is true, but you'd think the girl would catch on quicker).\n\nAdd to the mix three moronic dorm buddies who don't even resemble real people (or real college kids, for that matter; all three look to be around 25-30).  The only part of the movie I did like was the ending, when an "update" scrolled onto the screen to tell the future fates of these three idiots.  I chuckled at that part.  If only there was more to chuckle about.\n\nIt looks like Amy Heckerling tried really hard to pull this off, but I don't think it's really her fault.  After all, to direct and produce a really wonderful film, one has to have a wonderful script to start from. I don't think she had a chance.\n\nIf you want a fantastic school comedy, do yourself a favor; Save the $8.50 and go rent "Clueless".  So it deals with high school instead of college... it's still better.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26822,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
