Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he said he was manipulated from the off with deep anxiety and anticipation. It recently came out to rent on DVD and I must have watched it about six or seven times now and loved every viewing and there are very few films that I can say that about. It is superb, if you have not seen it, don't read on, just go and watch it. It is obviously not technically the best film of all time, but I don't care what anyone says, it has become my second favourite film ever made, its that good. My reasons for loving it are probably very personal, so excuse my if you think I'm overrating it. I showed it to my mates though and they all loved it.\n\nSPOILERS AHOY Its a dark, yes very dark film, but Meadows has a knack of using humour to ensure his work is never miserable or too depressing. The scene where Sonny accidentally shoots his mate in the head with a sniper rifle is gloriously farcical. I even had to chuckle during the scene where Richard shows Herbie the mangled body of Tuff because of Paddys fantastic acting- 'D'ya wanna give 'im kiss?', 'D'ya want me t' shut it? yeah', unbelievable. The drug scenes are some of the most realistic I've ever scene; whoever suggests they aren't needs to go out and drop some trips and say that again.\n\nJust like all his films (except Once Upon A Time In The Midlands), the soundtrack is spot on. Perfect songs used with impeccable timing create a distinct, moody atmosphere. All the acting is fantastic (even the little kids at the end) the improvisation works a treat and you genuinely feel as if you know these characters, or have met them somewhere before.\n\nI feel sorry for anyone who didn't like this film, you really are missing out. There's a few small continuity mistakes, but I only noticed them after watching it a few times and you've got to be a miserable git to let that spoil the experience. Shane and Paddy (if you're reading this), you are the best thing to happen to the British film industry since Loach, forget cockney gangsters. I can't wait for 'Le Donk'.

However when he loses everything to Russian player KGB he promises his girlfriend that he'll quit playing.  However a year later Mike's friend Worm comes out of prison and immediately entices Mike into an easy game.  Worm still has outstanding debts and Mike is drawn back into this world in order to help him win enough to pay them off.\n\nI taped this off TV with no real hope for it.  I knew it hadn't done well at the cinema and that it wasn't exactly a well known film  so I assumed it must be pretty poor.  However I was sold on it by the end and, although it's not brillant, it's good enough to watch at least once.  The plot is pretty simple but the characters make it watchable and the poker action is good. How many of us long to be Mike  to be able to read a table like that etc? The poker scenes may not all have excitement (you know who'll win) but they are interesting to watch.\n\nDamon caused me pause to doubt when he first came on the screen.  I just saw him in `Bourne Identity' and here he looks very young compared to that. However once I got past his baby face I accepted him although someone else might have been better.  Norton is great as always and very watchable.  Good support comes from an understated Turturro, Janssen, Landau and a slightly hammy Malkovich.  However they all do well given that they all drive the thin plot and make the film watchable.\n\nOverall it's not a great piece of work but it does have some really good performances and it works well as a drama with knobs on.  I wouldn't buy it but I'll watch it again if I see it on TV."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":144570,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However when he loses everything to Russian player KGB he promises his girlfriend that he'll quit playing.  However a year later Mike's friend Worm comes out of prison and immediately entices Mike into an easy game.  Worm still has outstanding debts and Mike is drawn back into this world in order to help him win enough to pay them off.\n\nI taped this off TV with no real hope for it.  I knew it hadn't done well at the cinema and that it wasn't exactly a well known film  so I assumed it must be pretty poor.  However I was sold on it by the end and, although it's not brillant, it's good enough to watch at least once.  The plot is pretty simple but the characters make it watchable and the poker action is good. How many of us long to be Mike  to be able to read a table like that etc? The poker scenes may not all have excitement (you know who'll win) but they are interesting to watch.\n\nDamon caused me pause to doubt when he first came on the screen.  I just saw him in `Bourne Identity' and here he looks very young compared to that. However once I got past his baby face I accepted him although someone else might have been better.  Norton is great as always and very watchable.  Good support comes from an understated Turturro, Janssen, Landau and a slightly hammy Malkovich.  However they all do well given that they all drive the thin plot and make the film watchable.\n\nOverall it's not a great piece of work but it does have some really good performances and it works well as a drama with knobs on.  I wouldn't buy it but I'll watch it again if I see it on TV.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":144570,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In New York City, a young counterfeiter named Shawn McArthur (Channing Tatum) tries to come up with a way to get enough money to live .

So many moments the only thing you see is a black screen. \n\nBut luckily the effects used were above mediocre. There aren't that many in it but the shooting in the head and the results are really a must see for gorehounds. Don't get me wrong, it is still worth picking up but as said, the mines could have been a bit shorter, it would made it a perfect flick.\n\nGore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3409,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It all starts pretty well with the future and the past perfectly blend into each other but the further this one goes it turns into a few problems.\n\nI can dig the whole story so-called based on true events a bit like they did wit Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) even the color grading used reminded me of those good old exploitation flicks.\n\nBut it's the ending, especially in the mines that took a bit too long for me because naturally it's pitch black in mines but it's also filmed that way. So many moments the only thing you see is a black screen. \n\nBut luckily the effects used were above mediocre. There aren't that many in it but the shooting in the head and the results are really a must see for gorehounds. Don't get me wrong, it is still worth picking up but as said, the mines could have been a bit shorter, it would made it a perfect flick.\n\nGore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3409,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is with this notion that Stranger than FictionFerrell's first major foray into a theatrical world outside the realm of in-your-face frat boy sillinessjust makes sense.

The romance that develops between Gyllenhal's outcast baker and Ferrell's strait-laced Crick doesn't feel entirely organic. We admire the relationship and smile at its sugar coated sweetness, but we don't necessarily believe their connection. It may taste good, but it doesn't exactly wash down smoothly. Neither, does the film's over reliance on reinforcing generic, "Carpe Diem" philosophies. Towards the second act, things do get sappy. Luckily, by the conclusion, the plot has bounced back to a wonderful limbo of both oddly comic and genuinely heartwarming moments.\n\nFor all its flaws, Stranger than Fiction, works.

But "The Grifters" has three, all of them petty swindlers, desperate for quick cash or good odds at a "long con". And it's the personal relationships among these three criminals, complex, sometimes dark, and almost always motivated by survival, that make this film a pretty good bet.\n\nRoy Dillon (John Cusack), is a trickster, a loner, "on the grift" for the "short con", strictly a nickels and dimes man. His mom is Lilly (Anjelica Huston); she's a middle-aged lady with white hair; she's seductive, cold-blooded, and tough as nails; she's been around the block a few times. Roy's love interest is Myra (Annette Bening), a shapely, fun loving babe who uses her charms to con rich businessmen. These three people are highly manipulative and scheming, on-guard, and mistrustful of each other and the rest of the world.\n\nThe film's tone is bleak and gloomy. There's very little "heart" in this film. And that's a problem, because I found these characters not very sympathetic. They lead lives of quiet desperation, grimy and tawdry. Still, "The Grifters" is a crime story in the best tradition of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, a pulpy melodrama about the underbelly of urban America.\n\nThe film's structure is conventional, and contains a number of flashbacks. The set-up is tediously long. The second half of the film is better than the first half, in my opinion, because the second half contains more suspense.\n\nDialogue is direct and tough, like when Lilly makes her point to the ambulance driver who takes Roy to the hospital and is skeptical about Roy's chances for survival: Says Lilly: "My son is gonna be alright, if not, I'll have you killed". Later, she explains the facts of life to her son: "Grifts like anything else Roy, you don't stand still, you either go up or down, usually down, sooner or later". Yes indeed, it's a tough life being a "grifter"; but Lilly is one tough broad.\n\nThe film's color cinematography is fine. And the film has a terrific title sequence and a great Elmer Bernstein score at the beginning. Editing, costumes, and production design are all credible.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a gritty, bleak story of petty criminals in a well made modern film, "The Grifters" is a good choice. As a bonus, the DVD has an exceptionally good Commentary, with insightful comments from Director Stephen Frears, and actors John Cusack and Anjelica Huston."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But "The Grifters" has three, all of them petty swindlers, desperate for quick cash or good odds at a "long con". And it's the personal relationships among these three criminals, complex, sometimes dark, and almost always motivated by survival, that make this film a pretty good bet.\n\nRoy Dillon (John Cusack), is a trickster, a loner, "on the grift" for the "short con", strictly a nickels and dimes man. His mom is Lilly (Anjelica Huston); she's a middle-aged lady with white hair; she's seductive, cold-blooded, and tough as nails; she's been around the block a few times. Roy's love interest is Myra (Annette Bening), a shapely, fun loving babe who uses her charms to con rich businessmen. These three people are highly manipulative and scheming, on-guard, and mistrustful of each other and the rest of the world.\n\nThe film's tone is bleak and gloomy. There's very little "heart" in this film. And that's a problem, because I found these characters not very sympathetic. They lead lives of quiet desperation, grimy and tawdry. Still, "The Grifters" is a crime story in the best tradition of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, a pulpy melodrama about the underbelly of urban America.\n\nThe film's structure is conventional, and contains a number of flashbacks. The set-up is tediously long. The second half of the film is better than the first half, in my opinion, because the second half contains more suspense.\n\nDialogue is direct and tough, like when Lilly makes her point to the ambulance driver who takes Roy to the hospital and is skeptical about Roy's chances for survival: Says Lilly: "My son is gonna be alright, if not, I'll have you killed". Later, she explains the facts of life to her son: "Grifts like anything else Roy, you don't stand still, you either go up or down, usually down, sooner or later". Yes indeed, it's a tough life being a "grifter"; but Lilly is one tough broad.\n\nThe film's color cinematography is fine. And the film has a terrific title sequence and a great Elmer Bernstein score at the beginning. Editing, costumes, and production design are all credible.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a gritty, bleak story of petty criminals in a well made modern film, "The Grifters" is a good choice. As a bonus, the DVD has an exceptionally good Commentary, with insightful comments from Director Stephen Frears, and actors John Cusack and Anjelica Huston.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First, San Antonio is a MAJORITY Mexican (yes, Mexican, not Hispanic and not a pejorative) city. It was part of Mexico BEFORE it was part of Texas or the USA. The city still embraces that heritage regardless of your particular race. There are few Mexicans on the staff whereas the hospitals in SA are representative of the local populace. There are more black people in this hospital than Mexican people which is insultingly wrong. I may be lily white, but where I shop, eat, and do anything, I am surrounded by not just 85%/15% white / black people.\n\nAfter their shift they talk about going out for pancakes and grits. That is totally the EXCEPTION for San Antonio. Elsewhere, this would not make sense, but in SA, its the Breakfast Taco. This is a normal tortilla filled with eggs / potatoes / chorizo / cheese / bacon or sausage. The countryside was settled by Germans and Poles in the early 1800's so you find incredible Polish Sausage and Kielbasa so even if they don't speak English, the restaurant has good sausage in the breakfast tacos. Only place in the country with this unique combination. You can't swing a dead cat in San Antonio without hitting a church or a restaurant that has breakfast tacos.\n\nThings they hit right are the military that come here and when they get out they stay here. Many of those military also have brown skin. It is good to see how the former military still maintain contact with current military but they always ask the white guys when they need military help and they seriously downplay the Asian doctor's service when it comes to phoning a friend for help. Only the white guys can reach out to other white guys in the military when they need military help?\n\nThe show also calls it wrong in hiring someone as a Physician's Assistant and treating them like a Physician's aide. A Physician's Assistant is an ACTUAL Title and has the same power as a Nurse Practitioner which have specific boards they have to pass, get their own patients, and write prescriptions. They're treated like doctors and given the same responsibilities except that a doctor simply has to review/sign off on their charts so they're NOT treated like assistants like in the show While actual specific privileges vary between states, they're treated like doctors almost universally.\n\nI feel slightly insulted they rely on a Mexican to translate to local immigrant families when in reality many of the staff who have skin of a different color (white or black, etc) would also be fluent. It's just part of the culture in SA while in California there's more of a stigma to it. If you're not Mexican and you speak some of the language, it's normal but in California it's often shunned. San Antonio embraces this which creates a more congenial atmosphere.\n\nReminding you that I have no Mexican heritage, hopefully you can see my point about the fact that the writers simply don't get the SA culture. They rely on cliché actors which unfortunately becomes rather bland quite quickly. Maybe they could reach out to Robert Rodriguez in Austin to grab some talent that would make an impact (no pun intended).\n\nIt would be great of the writers to interface the hospital staff with the Burn unit at Fort Sam which is widely considered the best burn center in the world.\n\nIn the show there are lots of pranks which are often funny and good spirited. In the real world, most of those would get someone in real trouble with the hospital policies since there is always that ONE person who complains and creates an actual incident out of a harmless prank as an HR issue. How I wish life could imitate art in this.\n\nEDITS: I am 13 episodes.\n\nAfter seeing it is filmed in Albuquerque, I must ask why they never thought to film in SA which would be MUCH less expensive and give them local shots. Shooting in Alb is completely out of touch. Might as well film it in Portland for how different it's from SA.\n\nIf there are 5 unique cities in the country including New Orleans &amp; SA, why not use the actual city because there's no substitute for unique.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews on blatant medical blunders, I would stress to the writers including a little more showing of washing hands, changing gloves, and medical sanitary procedures they would naturally follow while chatting which happens a lot more than chats up at the counters or store rooms. Doesn't waste film, just changes the set locations. Other than that, get over it since there is a review by a surgeon and everyone knows surgeons aren't mere humans. Yes, there is cinematic license, but use a medical adviser since half of the decisions shown where doctors ignore protocols would get them immediately suspended due to liability reasons and the malpractice insurance concerns. Sorry folks, doctors aren't rebellious when they pay 50K+ malpractice insurance but this is ignored for drama.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11363,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Only the white guys can reach out to other white guys in the military when they need military help?\n\nThe show also calls it wrong in hiring someone as a Physician's Assistant and treating them like a Physician's aide. A Physician's Assistant is an ACTUAL Title and has the same power as a Nurse Practitioner which have specific boards they have to pass, get their own patients, and write prescriptions. They're treated like doctors and given the same responsibilities except that a doctor simply has to review/sign off on their charts so they're NOT treated like assistants like in the show While actual specific privileges vary between states, they're treated like doctors almost universally.\n\nI feel slightly insulted they rely on a Mexican to translate to local immigrant families when in reality many of the staff who have skin of a different color (white or black, etc) would also be fluent. It's just part of the culture in SA while in California there's more of a stigma to it. If you're not Mexican and you speak some of the language, it's normal but in California it's often shunned. San Antonio embraces this which creates a more congenial atmosphere.\n\nReminding you that I have no Mexican heritage, hopefully you can see my point about the fact that the writers simply don't get the SA culture. They rely on cliché actors which unfortunately becomes rather bland quite quickly. Maybe they could reach out to Robert Rodriguez in Austin to grab some talent that would make an impact (no pun intended).\n\nIt would be great of the writers to interface the hospital staff with the Burn unit at Fort Sam which is widely considered the best burn center in the world.\n\nIn the show there are lots of pranks which are often funny and good spirited. In the real world, most of those would get someone in real trouble with the hospital policies since there is always that ONE person who complains and creates an actual incident out of a harmless prank as an HR issue. How I wish life could imitate art in this.\n\nEDITS: I am 13 episodes.\n\nAfter seeing it is filmed in Albuquerque, I must ask why they never thought to film in SA which would be MUCH less expensive and give them local shots. Shooting in Alb is completely out of touch. Might as well film it in Portland for how different it's from SA.\n\nIf there are 5 unique cities in the country including New Orleans &amp; SA, why not use the actual city because there's no substitute for unique.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews on blatant medical blunders, I would stress to the writers including a little more showing of washing hands, changing gloves, and medical sanitary procedures they would naturally follow while chatting which happens a lot more than chats up at the counters or store rooms. Doesn't waste film, just changes the set locations. Other than that, get over it since there is a review by a surgeon and everyone knows surgeons aren't mere humans. Yes, there is cinematic license, but use a medical adviser since half of the decisions shown where doctors ignore protocols would get them immediately suspended due to liability reasons and the malpractice insurance concerns. Sorry folks, doctors aren't rebellious when they pay 50K+ malpractice insurance but this is ignored for drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11363,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First, San Antonio is a MAJORITY Mexican (yes, Mexican, not Hispanic and not a pejorative) city. It was part of Mexico BEFORE it was part of Texas or the USA. The city still embraces that heritage regardless of your particular race. There are few Mexicans on the staff whereas the hospitals in SA are representative of the local populace. There are more black people in this hospital than Mexican people which is insultingly wrong. I may be lily white, but where I shop, eat, and do anything, I am surrounded by not just 85%/15% white / black people.\n\nAfter their shift they talk about going out for pancakes and grits. That is totally the EXCEPTION for San Antonio. Elsewhere, this would not make sense, but in SA, its the Breakfast Taco. This is a normal tortilla filled with eggs / potatoes / chorizo / cheese / bacon or sausage. The countryside was settled by Germans and Poles in the early 1800's so you find incredible Polish Sausage and Kielbasa so even if they don't speak English, the restaurant has good sausage in the breakfast tacos. Only place in the country with this unique combination. You can't swing a dead cat in San Antonio without hitting a church or a restaurant that has breakfast tacos.\n\nThings they hit right are the military that come here and when they get out they stay here. Many of those military also have brown skin. It is good to see how the former military still maintain contact with current military but they always ask the white guys when they need military help and they seriously downplay the Asian doctor's service when it comes to phoning a friend for help. Only the white guys can reach out to other white guys in the military when they need military help?\n\nThe show also calls it wrong in hiring someone as a Physician's Assistant and treating them like a Physician's aide.

Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

On one end, there were few moments where I did enjoy the film. The actors are powerhouses and did what they could with the material given to them. Some plot points were interesting to me and had my attention and lastly, I am sure there is a certain symbolism behind the constant use of the color red that is shown in a high majority of scenes. On the other end, however, there was way too much I did not enjoy. From start to finish, I hardly understood any of the characters connections to anyone. They are explained in as little detail as possible. It just was not my cup of tea as far as understanding who the characters were and what was their purpose. Kate Winslet was absolutely atrocious to me. From her seemingly forced role to her forgetful "Russian accent" as she seemed to forget she was Russian at times speaking perfect English and bouncing back to an "accent". The fan- favorite star power of Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor and company was no where near enough to save this movie and draw enough of a crowd to make this movie even mistakenly good. Too many negatives and not enough positives. This movie is forgetful to me and nothing special. A few moments do not make up for a near two hours of confusion and plot holes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69602,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-02-26","keywords":"heist,corrupt cop,betrayal,police detective,two word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1446294809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwMjIxODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwMjIxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A gang of criminals and corrupt cops plan the murder of a police officer in order to pull off their biggest heist yet across town."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000729/","name":"Casey Affleck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1107001/","name":"Anthony Mackie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384825/","name":"John Hillcoat"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001099/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017525/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0535275/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3208946/","name":"Matt Cook"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

On one end, there were few moments where I did enjoy the film. The actors are powerhouses and did what they could with the material given to them. Some plot points were interesting to me and had my attention and lastly, I am sure there is a certain symbolism behind the constant use of the color red that is shown in a high majority of scenes. On the other end, however, there was way too much I did not enjoy. From start to finish, I hardly understood any of the characters connections to anyone. They are explained in as little detail as possible. It just was not my cup of tea as far as understanding who the characters were and what was their purpose. Kate Winslet was absolutely atrocious to me. From her seemingly forced role to her forgetful "Russian accent" as she seemed to forget she was Russian at times speaking perfect English and bouncing back to an "accent". The fan- favorite star power of Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor and company was no where near enough to save this movie and draw enough of a crowd to make this movie even mistakenly good. Too many negatives and not enough positives. This movie is forgetful to me and nothing special. A few moments do not make up for a near two hours of confusion and plot holes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69602,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-02-26","keywords":"heist,corrupt cop,betrayal,police detective,two word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1446294809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwMjIxODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwMjIxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A gang of criminals and corrupt cops plan the murder of a police officer in order to pull off their biggest heist yet across town.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000729/","name":"Casey Affleck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1107001/","name":"Anthony Mackie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384825/","name":"John Hillcoat"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001099/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017525/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0535275/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3208946/","name":"Matt Cook"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First, San Antonio is a MAJORITY Mexican (yes, Mexican, not Hispanic and not a pejorative) city. It was part of Mexico BEFORE it was part of Texas or the USA. The city still embraces that heritage regardless of your particular race. There are few Mexicans on the staff whereas the hospitals in SA are representative of the local populace. There are more black people in this hospital than Mexican people which is insultingly wrong. I may be lily white, but where I shop, eat, and do anything, I am surrounded by not just 85%/15% white / black people.\n\nAfter their shift they talk about going out for pancakes and grits. That is totally the EXCEPTION for San Antonio. Elsewhere, this would not make sense, but in SA, its the Breakfast Taco. This is a normal tortilla filled with eggs / potatoes / chorizo / cheese / bacon or sausage. The countryside was settled by Germans and Poles in the early 1800's so you find incredible Polish Sausage and Kielbasa so even if they don't speak English, the restaurant has good sausage in the breakfast tacos. Only place in the country with this unique combination. You can't swing a dead cat in San Antonio without hitting a church or a restaurant that has breakfast tacos.\n\nThings they hit right are the military that come here and when they get out they stay here. Many of those military also have brown skin. It is good to see how the former military still maintain contact with current military but they always ask the white guys when they need military help and they seriously downplay the Asian doctor's service when it comes to phoning a friend for help. Only the white guys can reach out to other white guys in the military when they need military help?\n\nThe show also calls it wrong in hiring someone as a Physician's Assistant and treating them like a Physician's aide. A Physician's Assistant is an ACTUAL Title and has the same power as a Nurse Practitioner which have specific boards they have to pass, get their own patients, and write prescriptions. They're treated like doctors and given the same responsibilities except that a doctor simply has to review/sign off on their charts so they're NOT treated like assistants like in the show While actual specific privileges vary between states, they're treated like doctors almost universally.\n\nI feel slightly insulted they rely on a Mexican to translate to local immigrant families when in reality many of the staff who have skin of a different color (white or black, etc) would also be fluent. It's just part of the culture in SA while in California there's more of a stigma to it. If you're not Mexican and you speak some of the language, it's normal but in California it's often shunned. San Antonio embraces this which creates a more congenial atmosphere.\n\nReminding you that I have no Mexican heritage, hopefully you can see my point about the fact that the writers simply don't get the SA culture. They rely on cliché actors which unfortunately becomes rather bland quite quickly. Maybe they could reach out to Robert Rodriguez in Austin to grab some talent that would make an impact (no pun intended).\n\nIt would be great of the writers to interface the hospital staff with the Burn unit at Fort Sam which is widely considered the best burn center in the world.\n\nIn the show there are lots of pranks which are often funny and good spirited. In the real world, most of those would get someone in real trouble with the hospital policies since there is always that ONE person who complains and creates an actual incident out of a harmless prank as an HR issue. How I wish life could imitate art in this.\n\nEDITS: I am 13 episodes.\n\nAfter seeing it is filmed in Albuquerque, I must ask why they never thought to film in SA which would be MUCH less expensive and give them local shots. Shooting in Alb is completely out of touch. Might as well film it in Portland for how different it's from SA.\n\nIf there are 5 unique cities in the country including New Orleans &amp; SA, why not use the actual city because there's no substitute for unique.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews on blatant medical blunders, I would stress to the writers including a little more showing of washing hands, changing gloves, and medical sanitary procedures they would naturally follow while chatting which happens a lot more than chats up at the counters or store rooms. Doesn't waste film, just changes the set locations. Other than that, get over it since there is a review by a surgeon and everyone knows surgeons aren't mere humans. Yes, there is cinematic license, but use a medical adviser since half of the decisions shown where doctors ignore protocols would get them immediately suspended due to liability reasons and the malpractice insurance concerns. Sorry folks, doctors aren't rebellious when they pay 50K+ malpractice insurance but this is ignored for drama.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11363,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

San Antonio embraces this which creates a more congenial atmosphere.\n\nReminding you that I have no Mexican heritage, hopefully you can see my point about the fact that the writers simply don't get the SA culture. They rely on cliché actors which unfortunately becomes rather bland quite quickly. Maybe they could reach out to Robert Rodriguez in Austin to grab some talent that would make an impact (no pun intended).\n\nIt would be great of the writers to interface the hospital staff with the Burn unit at Fort Sam which is widely considered the best burn center in the world.\n\nIn the show there are lots of pranks which are often funny and good spirited. In the real world, most of those would get someone in real trouble with the hospital policies since there is always that ONE person who complains and creates an actual incident out of a harmless prank as an HR issue. How I wish life could imitate art in this.\n\nEDITS: I am 13 episodes.\n\nAfter seeing it is filmed in Albuquerque, I must ask why they never thought to film in SA which would be MUCH less expensive and give them local shots. Shooting in Alb is completely out of touch.

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively.

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We follow the story of John Brown through the eyes of the fictional Little Onion - a teenager emancipated through violence and trying for the most part to simply survive this turbulent era in American history. It's a slightly irreverent version of real events, with Brown's formidable wife sadly excised but its fanciful twirls are neatly balanced against the brutality and come across as keen wit rather than clumsy revisionism. The real lynchpin of the whole endeavour is Ethan Hawke's battered Brown who oscillates wildly between devout believer and violent zealot never quite settling into anything categorizable but is a bewitching screen presence (despite portraits of Brown clearly pointing at Willem Defoe as the obvious choice - a casting bugbear that may bother me forever).\n\nThe cast are uniformly impressive, from personal favourites like Beau Knapp, Wyatt Russell and Steve Zahn to revelatory turns by a rather pompous Daveed Diggs and the arrestingly bemused Joshua Caleb Johnson who shines throughout. Also KILLER MIKE IS IN IT. GUYS, KILLER MIKE. GUYS. SERIOUSLY. What's more it feels a timely story - John Brown is the first American tried for treason and through him is the existential prism of what America was and is. A wrestle of our times, of all times, is it THE grand experiment of self-identification, freedom and democracy or the turbulent land of overt evangelism and violent segregation? Either way or neither way the US is inarguably at the pinnacle of televisual storytelling and the Good Lord Bird is a fantastic addition to that weighty canon of great American TV stories and a nice atmospheric taster for the complex and bloody historical legacy of abolitionism.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2020-10-04","keywords":"tv mini series,abolitionist,religious movement,anti slavery group,civil war","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2428854/","name":"Hubert Point-Du Jour"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3354041/","name":"Beau Knapp"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0639917/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3065168153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Ethan Hawke stars as abolitionist John Brown in this Limited Event Series produced by Blumhouse Television based on the award-winning novel.

The real lynchpin of the whole endeavour is Ethan Hawke's battered Brown who oscillates wildly between devout believer and violent zealot never quite settling into anything categorizable but is a bewitching screen presence (despite portraits of Brown clearly pointing at Willem Defoe as the obvious choice - a casting bugbear that may bother me forever).\n\nThe cast are uniformly impressive, from personal favourites like Beau Knapp, Wyatt Russell and Steve Zahn to revelatory turns by a rather pompous Daveed Diggs and the arrestingly bemused Joshua Caleb Johnson who shines throughout.

We follow the story of John Brown through the eyes of the fictional Little Onion - a teenager emancipated through violence and trying for the most part to simply survive this turbulent era in American history. It's a slightly irreverent version of real events, with Brown's formidable wife sadly excised but its fanciful twirls are neatly balanced against the brutality and come across as keen wit rather than clumsy revisionism. The real lynchpin of the whole endeavour is Ethan Hawke's battered Brown who oscillates wildly between devout believer and violent zealot never quite settling into anything categorizable but is a bewitching screen presence (despite portraits of Brown clearly pointing at Willem Defoe as the obvious choice - a casting bugbear that may bother me forever).\n\nThe cast are uniformly impressive, from personal favourites like Beau Knapp, Wyatt Russell and Steve Zahn to revelatory turns by a rather pompous Daveed Diggs and the arrestingly bemused Joshua Caleb Johnson who shines throughout. Also KILLER MIKE IS IN IT. GUYS, KILLER MIKE. GUYS. SERIOUSLY. What's more it feels a timely story - John Brown is the first American tried for treason and through him is the existential prism of what America was and is. A wrestle of our times, of all times, is it THE grand experiment of self-identification, freedom and democracy or the turbulent land of overt evangelism and violent segregation? Either way or neither way the US is inarguably at the pinnacle of televisual storytelling and the Good Lord Bird is a fantastic addition to that weighty canon of great American TV stories and a nice atmospheric taster for the complex and bloody historical legacy of abolitionism.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2020-10-04","keywords":"tv mini series,abolitionist,religious movement,anti slavery group,civil war","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2428854/","name":"Hubert Point-Du Jour"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3354041/","name":"Beau Knapp"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0639917/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3065168153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Ethan Hawke stars as abolitionist John Brown in this Limited Event Series produced by Blumhouse Television based on the award-winning novel.

The real lynchpin of the whole endeavour is Ethan Hawke's battered Brown who oscillates wildly between devout believer and violent zealot never quite settling into anything categorizable but is a bewitching screen presence (despite portraits of Brown clearly pointing at Willem Defoe as the obvious choice - a casting bugbear that may bother me forever).\n\nThe cast are uniformly impressive, from personal favourites like Beau Knapp, Wyatt Russell and Steve Zahn to revelatory turns by a rather pompous Daveed Diggs and the arrestingly bemused Joshua Caleb Johnson who shines throughout.

A wrestle of our times, of all times, is it THE grand experiment of self-identification, freedom and democracy or the turbulent land of overt evangelism and violent segregation? Either way or neither way the US is inarguably at the pinnacle of televisual storytelling and the Good Lord Bird is a fantastic addition to that weighty canon of great American TV stories and a nice atmospheric taster for the complex and bloody historical legacy of abolitionism.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2020-10-04","keywords":"tv mini series,abolitionist,religious movement,anti slavery group,civil war","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2428854/","name":"Hubert Point-Du Jour"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3354041/","name":"Beau Knapp"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0639917/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3065168153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Ethan Hawke stars as abolitionist John Brown in this Limited Event Series produced by Blumhouse Television based on the award-winning novel.

We follow the story of John Brown through the eyes of the fictional Little Onion - a teenager emancipated through violence and trying for the most part to simply survive this turbulent era in American history. It's a slightly irreverent version of real events, with Brown's formidable wife sadly excised but its fanciful twirls are neatly balanced against the brutality and come across as keen wit rather than clumsy revisionism. The real lynchpin of the whole endeavour is Ethan Hawke's battered Brown who oscillates wildly between devout believer and violent zealot never quite settling into anything categorizable but is a bewitching screen presence (despite portraits of Brown clearly pointing at Willem Defoe as the obvious choice - a casting bugbear that may bother me forever).\n\nThe cast are uniformly impressive, from personal favourites like Beau Knapp, Wyatt Russell and Steve Zahn to revelatory turns by a rather pompous Daveed Diggs and the arrestingly bemused Joshua Caleb Johnson who shines throughout. Also KILLER MIKE IS IN IT. GUYS, KILLER MIKE. GUYS. SERIOUSLY. What's more it feels a timely story - John Brown is the first American tried for treason and through him is the existential prism of what America was and is. A wrestle of our times, of all times, is it THE grand experiment of self-identification, freedom and democracy or the turbulent land of overt evangelism and violent segregation? Either way or neither way the US is inarguably at the pinnacle of televisual storytelling and the Good Lord Bird is a fantastic addition to that weighty canon of great American TV stories and a nice atmospheric taster for the complex and bloody historical legacy of abolitionism.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2020-10-04","keywords":"tv mini series,abolitionist,religious movement,anti slavery group,civil war","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2428854/","name":"Hubert Point-Du Jour","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3354041/","name":"Beau Knapp"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0639917/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3065168153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNmYTY4N2ItZTE3Yy00NWQ3LWI3NzEtOTk0ZGJiNmYwZmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Ethan Hawke stars as abolitionist John Brown in this Limited Event Series produced by Blumhouse Television based on the award-winning novel. The story is told from the point of view of "Onion," a fictional enslaved boy who becomes a member of Brown's motley family of abolitionist soldiers battling slavery in Kansas, and eventually finds himself in the famous 1859 Army depot raid at Harpers Ferry, an inciting incident of the Civil War. It's a humorous and dramatic tale of Antebellum America and the ever-changing roles of race, religion and gender in American society."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">365 obiadów Mariety Mareckiej</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Gospodyni programu podpowiada, skąd czerpać inspiracje na codzienne obiady. Marieta Marecka zaprezentuje szereg pomysłowych i prostych w przygotowaniu posiłków. Podpowie też, jak odpowiedzialnie podchodzić do gotowania. W każdym odcinku prowadząca zaprezentuje trzy nowe, często zaskakujące potrawy, które złożą się w gotowy plan na obiad dla całej rodziny. Marieta udzieli również wskazówek na temat tego, co i za ile najlepiej kupić, jakie składniki możemy zamieniać na tańsze oraz jak robić zakupy w sposób przemyślany. Swój udział w tworzeniu programu po raz pierwszy otrzymają również widzowie, którzy poprzez przesyłane przez siebie zdjęcia, prezentować będą zawartość lodówki oraz pomysł na to, co można ugotować z takich składników.</desc>

Thought the characters were well thought out and believable. The interaction between Ruby, Liam, Chubb &amp; Zu was great, but I did wonder why Zu didn't speak (I missed the 1st 5 minutes, so maybe it was in there why). The 'world' was different. I even cried at the end. I read it was an adaptation, I was wondering because, although the movie finished, there was enough left over for there to be a part 2.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Gospodyni programu podpowiada, skąd czerpać inspiracje na codzienne obiady. Marieta Marecka zaprezentuje szereg pomysłowych i prostych w przygotowaniu posiłków. Podpowie też, jak odpowiedzialnie podchodzić do gotowania. W każdym odcinku prowadząca zaprezentuje trzy nowe, często zaskakujące potrawy, które złożą się w gotowy plan na obiad dla całej rodziny. Marieta udzieli również wskazówek na temat tego, co i za ile najlepiej kupić, jakie składniki możemy zamieniać na tańsze oraz jak robić zakupy w sposób przemyślany. Swój udział w tworzeniu programu po raz pierwszy otrzymają również widzowie, którzy poprzez przesyłane przez siebie zdjęcia, prezentować będą zawartość lodówki oraz pomysł na to, co można ugotować z takich składników.</desc>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!) Go see this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the West, he is known through his latest films (Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle), but in the East he's been a comedy phenomenon for years. He started his career in the early 90s as an actor, launched by several famous Hong Kong directors. It didn't take him long to start directing films himself, which brought him his current fame.\n\nA new Chow film is probably the most important public film event throughout the larger part of Asia. That said, the stakes were high for CJ7.\n\nChow is best known for his typical comedy formula: a mix of Hong-Kong humor, parody and crazy special effects that make his films stand out from the crowd. In that sense, CJ7 will be a surprise to many viewers. Talking about viewer expectations, Chow's new film could be compared to Danny Boyle's Millions. A film from a director that throws himself at the children's market without losing too much of its own identity, but with the chance of losing many of its initial fans.\n\nCJ7 contains enough typical Chow humor to make it recognizable, but at the same time CJ7 is targeted at a younger audience, with many themes lifted directly from other children's films. Take ET, add some Totoro, mix it with Chow's comedy and what you have is something close to CJ7. It's probably a good thing to realize this before going into the movie, as many will go in with the wrong idea and will be left disappointed by the film.\n\nIf you get used to the idea that this film is a bit different from Chow's other films, it turns out to be a pretty sweet, nifty and funny film after all. Most of the main roles are played by small kids, and they do a pretty great job. The main role is a bit too soft maybe, but the mini-triad kid is hilarious, the fat kids are plain weird (I wonder how they were filmed) and the little girl is really too cute.\n\nOf course there's also the alien, which is a cuddly little animal. It's digitally created but feels like a living, breathing, rubber bath toy. An awesome creation that plays a large part in the film's charm. To make it complete, Chow himself takes on the role of the father, which he does well (as usual). I think Chow's style of acting can easily put people off, as he seems pretty aware of the comedic scenes he's delivering (much like Takeshi Kitano), but his presence on screen is warm and compelling enough not to be bothered by it.\n\nThe film looks pretty lush and colorful, Chow really made some progress in the visual department. Although the special effect are still behind Hollywood standards, Chow keeps them functional and funny at all times, which makes the lacking technical qualities easy to forgive. The soundtrack could have been a bit less dramatic I think, although I guess those are the downsides of making a film mostly targeted at kids.\n\nCJ7 is still a funny film, though the number and range of gags is a lot smaller. They are replaced by a pretty typical but warm children's tale. The result is a film that could charm you as easily as it could disappoint you. Chow is enough of a director to pull it off, but those wanting another typical Chow comedy will be left with empty hands. Those willing to go along with Chow's fluff will be treated to a fun and cutesy film. 4.0*/5.0*","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14881,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the West, he is known through his latest films (Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle), but in the East he's been a comedy phenomenon for years. He started his career in the early 90s as an actor, launched by several famous Hong Kong directors. It didn't take him long to start directing films himself, which brought him his current fame.\n\nA new Chow film is probably the most important public film event throughout the larger part of Asia. That said, the stakes were high for CJ7.\n\nChow is best known for his typical comedy formula: a mix of Hong-Kong humor, parody and crazy special effects that make his films stand out from the crowd. In that sense, CJ7 will be a surprise to many viewers. Talking about viewer expectations, Chow's new film could be compared to Danny Boyle's Millions. A film from a director that throws himself at the children's market without losing too much of its own identity, but with the chance of losing many of its initial fans.\n\nCJ7 contains enough typical Chow humor to make it recognizable, but at the same time CJ7 is targeted at a younger audience, with many themes lifted directly from other children's films. Take ET, add some Totoro, mix it with Chow's comedy and what you have is something close to CJ7. It's probably a good thing to realize this before going into the movie, as many will go in with the wrong idea and will be left disappointed by the film.\n\nIf you get used to the idea that this film is a bit different from Chow's other films, it turns out to be a pretty sweet, nifty and funny film after all. Most of the main roles are played by small kids, and they do a pretty great job. The main role is a bit too soft maybe, but the mini-triad kid is hilarious, the fat kids are plain weird (I wonder how they were filmed) and the little girl is really too cute.\n\nOf course there's also the alien, which is a cuddly little animal. It's digitally created but feels like a living, breathing, rubber bath toy. An awesome creation that plays a large part in the film's charm. To make it complete, Chow himself takes on the role of the father, which he does well (as usual). I think Chow's style of acting can easily put people off, as he seems pretty aware of the comedic scenes he's delivering (much like Takeshi Kitano), but his presence on screen is warm and compelling enough not to be bothered by it.\n\nThe film looks pretty lush and colorful, Chow really made some progress in the visual department. Although the special effect are still behind Hollywood standards, Chow keeps them functional and funny at all times, which makes the lacking technical qualities easy to forgive. The soundtrack could have been a bit less dramatic I think, although I guess those are the downsides of making a film mostly targeted at kids.\n\nCJ7 is still a funny film, though the number and range of gags is a lot smaller. They are replaced by a pretty typical but warm children's tale. The result is a film that could charm you as easily as it could disappoint you.

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, I question whether Flaubert's masterpiece can ever be translated graciously to the screen.  I suspect that a novel famous for having every word exactly in place, and whose appeal lies as much in the relentless poetic flow of its prose as in the brutally frank psychological characterization of its heroine (and a few other characters!), may be forever out of the reach of other media, and might best be left to pursue its own life on paper.\n\nI also agree that Ms. Huppert's portrayal is cold, but I've always seen Emma as being that way.  After all--she's nuts.  Crazy people are seldom full of human warmth.  Emma Bovary is among the select handful of fictional characters neurotic enough to have given their names to a pathological condition (in this case, bovarism).\n\nIt's always possible to admire a movie for its visual beauty, and this one wins hands-down in that category.  \n\nBut if you want the full impact of the wretched, wrenching story--you have to go back to the book.  I applaud Mr. Chabrol for trying, even if he didn't succeed, to make a perhaps impossible adaptation."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, I question whether Flaubert's masterpiece can ever be translated graciously to the screen.  I suspect that a novel famous for having every word exactly in place, and whose appeal lies as much in the relentless poetic flow of its prose as in the brutally frank psychological characterization of its heroine (and a few other characters!), may be forever out of the reach of other media, and might best be left to pursue its own life on paper.\n\nI also agree that Ms. Huppert's portrayal is cold, but I've always seen Emma as being that way.  After all--she's nuts.  Crazy people are seldom full of human warmth.  Emma Bovary is among the select handful of fictional characters neurotic enough to have given their names to a pathological condition (in this case, bovarism).\n\nIt's always possible to admire a movie for its visual beauty, and this one wins hands-down in that category.  \n\nBut if you want the full impact of the wretched, wrenching story--you have to go back to the book.  I applaud Mr. Chabrol for trying, even if he didn't succeed, to make a perhaps impossible adaptation.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished.

Masterful storytelling when combined with expert filmmaking is a treasure to be appreciated and enjoyed, even if the story is not so pleasant. Such is the case with this gem from writer-director Karim Ainouz, who adapted the screenplay with Murilo Hauser and Ines Bortagaray from the novel "The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao" by Martha Bathala. Based in Rio de Janiero, the film blends the vibrant colors of the area with the traditional and restrictive Latin American family expectations of the 1950's.\n\nThe story spans 5 or 6 decades, and when we first meet sisters Euridice and Guida, it's clear they share a tight emotional bond that goes deeper than blood. Though their personalities differ greatly, they are both ahead of their time and out of step with the conventions of the era. Euridice (a strong performance by Carol Duarte) longs for independence and aspires to be a concert pianist after a hoped-for Conservatory in Vienna, while Guida (a powerhouse Julia Stockler) is a dreamer seeking true love, and whose party girl ways must be kept hidden from their conservative father. Both young ladies are spirited, yet respectful.\n\nTheir lives are forever altered when Guida runs off to Greece with her sailor lover. As is too often the case with young dreamers, she returns home once her spontaneous choices prove to be poor judgment. Her father rejects his pregnant daughter since, in his eyes, she has disgraced the family. The parents mislead Guida about her sister's whereabouts, so Guida assumes Euridice is off at conservatory fulfilling her dreams. This sets Guida off on her own solitary path.\n\nIn actuality, Euridice has married and experienced one of the worst ever wedding nights, featuring what is likely cinema's most unsexy bathroom lovemaking scene. There is an element of horror films to this segment of the film, as the sisters are living their worst nightmares, while being separated from each other ... unable to communicate. The male-dominated Latin culture and family traditions prevent their mother from 'disobeying' the father's order, so the cruel lie continues as the sisters unknowingly live their lives within the same town. There is even one excruciatingly painful-to-watch scene that finds them in the same restaurant at the same time, yet oblivious to the presence of the other.\n\nEach woman's inner-strength pushes them forward. Guida (now Gisele) befriends a wise former prostitute Filomena (an excellent Barbara Santos) who becomes her mentor in poverty. Euridice tries to make the best of her situation while keeping her dream alive. Mostly what we have is a tragic story without one specific tragedy - other than the daughter spurned by her father. There are so many moments of pain and frustration, with undelivered mail being among the worst. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Helene Louvart, and it reminds us that 'life happens', and it's not all love and Bach. This is an emotional and heart-breaking story, and devotees of The Lifetime Channel will likely be disappointed in the ending. For me, I have no qualms about the emotional wringer the film puts viewers through - even after the opening scene foreshadowing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6797,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Euridice (a strong performance by Carol Duarte) longs for independence and aspires to be a concert pianist after a hoped-for Conservatory in Vienna, while Guida (a powerhouse Julia Stockler) is a dreamer seeking true love, and whose party girl ways must be kept hidden from their conservative father. Both young ladies are spirited, yet respectful.\n\nTheir lives are forever altered when Guida runs off to Greece with her sailor lover. As is too often the case with young dreamers, she returns home once her spontaneous choices prove to be poor judgment. Her father rejects his pregnant daughter since, in his eyes, she has disgraced the family. The parents mislead Guida about her sister's whereabouts, so Guida assumes Euridice is off at conservatory fulfilling her dreams. This sets Guida off on her own solitary path.\n\nIn actuality, Euridice has married and experienced one of the worst ever wedding nights, featuring what is likely cinema's most unsexy bathroom lovemaking scene. There is an element of horror films to this segment of the film, as the sisters are living their worst nightmares, while being separated from each other ... unable to communicate. The male-dominated Latin culture and family traditions prevent their mother from 'disobeying' the father's order, so the cruel lie continues as the sisters unknowingly live their lives within the same town. There is even one excruciatingly painful-to-watch scene that finds them in the same restaurant at the same time, yet oblivious to the presence of the other.\n\nEach woman's inner-strength pushes them forward. Guida (now Gisele) befriends a wise former prostitute Filomena (an excellent Barbara Santos) who becomes her mentor in poverty. Euridice tries to make the best of her situation while keeping her dream alive. Mostly what we have is a tragic story without one specific tragedy - other than the daughter spurned by her father. There are so many moments of pain and frustration, with undelivered mail being among the worst. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Helene Louvart, and it reminds us that 'life happens', and it's not all love and Bach. This is an emotional and heart-breaking story, and devotees of The Lifetime Channel will likely be disappointed in the ending. For me, I have no qualms about the emotional wringer the film puts viewers through - even after the opening scene foreshadowing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6797,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThe complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child. And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.\n\n Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any 'real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that 'one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.\n\nThe Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.\n\nHowever it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.\n\nBut if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Eventually, just months before the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he is fired by Piedmont's President...

Here he brings the story of Richard Jewell, whom you may recall was a security officer at Atlanta's Centennial Park the night a bomb attack killed 2 and wounded many more. For reasons the movie reveals in great details (but I don't want to spoil for you), Jewell becomes a "person of interest" and the frantic media jump on the story. It is frankly incredibly frightening when you put it all into context and see how a man's life gets mauled. Per the usual, Eastwood does a great job to keep the movie going forward. The all- star ensemble cast is incredible: Paul Walter Hauser IS Richard Jewell, and Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde are equally outstanding. This movie was filmed in the Spring of this year, and now barely 6 months later, it is already in theaters.\n\n"Richard Jewell" premiered wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended dismally (4 people exactly), much to my surprise. If you have any interest to see how the 1996 Atlanta bombing played out, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene.

Please ABC bring this show back for another season. It will break my heart if they do not. I e-mailed ABC with my opinion so hopefully that will help. I already pre-ordered season one on DVD so that shows how much I love this show. I was never a fan of Nathon Fillion before but I am now. I even went out and bought Waitress just I could watch him.

It's not about the endless romance between the doctors and nurses; it's not focused on the sexual perks and pains of the staff's sexual life, it is really focused about the medical aspect of the hospital. The characters are very refreshing and particularly Ryan Eggold is so endearing in his first remarkable role, I've actually never paid much attention to him before.

They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the title character, I wasn't completely sure of what to think of her but she, like everyone else in the cast, eventually grew on me as the movie went on. And she's accompanied in the film by many compelling actors like Rhys Ifans, Maggie Smith, Ralph Fiennes, and Maggie Gyllenhaal who sounds fine sporting an English accent. There's also an appearance by Ewan McGregor in a role I don't want to reveal. Also fine were the children playing Ms. Gyllenhaal's offspring and the cousins who convincingly transition from spoiled rotten to more socially appealing during the picture. And the special effects involving the animals also rate highly with me. So on that note, Nanny McPhee Returns comes much recommended from me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29879,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the title character, I wasn't completely sure of what to think of her but she, like everyone else in the cast, eventually grew on me as the movie went on. And she's accompanied in the film by many compelling actors like Rhys Ifans, Maggie Smith, Ralph Fiennes, and Maggie Gyllenhaal who sounds fine sporting an English accent. There's also an appearance by Ewan McGregor in a role I don't want to reveal. Also fine were the children playing Ms. Gyllenhaal's offspring and the cousins who convincingly transition from spoiled rotten to more socially appealing during the picture. And the special effects involving the animals also rate highly with me. So on that note, Nanny McPhee Returns comes much recommended from me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29879,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It wouldn't be the last time, however, that the portrayal was an exaggeration of coprolalia (the swearing tic), the shock value of which was used for a cheap and easy laugh.\n\nOver the years, I've seen that many people have presumptions about this neurological disorder - understandable, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, I've also learned the hard way that many of these presumptions have been heavily (and negatively) biased towards this inferred 'swearing tic', and I can't help but feel like Deuce Bigalow, or Not Another Teen Movie, or others, have helped shape this presumption.\n\nThe presumption honestly doesn't bother me, provided the person holding the belief is willing to have a conversation with me about it. I've always been open about my Tourette, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate to have won awards, or spoken with the media, or inspired others, due to my openness and having some small success with writing and acting.\n\nWhat does get to me, though, is when the people aren't willing to have a conversation with me. I've been fired from jobs once it's become known that I have Tourette, even though it hasn't affected my work. I've had dates suddenly lose interest. I've been kicked out of bars when bouncers have mistaken my tics for drug use and refused to hear any explanation without threatening violence.\n\nSo when I heard that Edward Norton would be portraying someone with Tourette Syndrome in #MotherlessBrooklyn, I was excited to see what an actor of such calibre would do with such a complex condition. And I was not disappointed.\n\nMotherless Brooklyn is great. Adapted from the novel and written and directed for the screen by Edward himself, the film is an enthralling and charming noir detective piece peppered with big names playing relatively small roles, all of whom tell a captivating story about government corruption in 1950s New York.\n\nEdward's presentation of Tourette Syndrome was refreshing. It was delivered with a level of maturity and respect that is seldom seen on the silver screen. And even though the condition is never outright named in the film, much like his tics, it can't be hidden from anyone watching.\n\nAnd yes, his character does have coprolalia, and echolalia (the tic where you have to repeat things said), and other verbal and motor tics. And sometimes it's funny. But his tics aren't just a cheap laugh for the audience - they affect his character. A PI trying to stay unnoticed on the subway who suddenly blurts out some choice words and draws attention to himself is funny. And when he's consoling someone and can't stop touching their shoulder, it's funny. And when they reassure him that it's okay, it's endearing.\n\nAnd it's okay for us to laugh at the realities of life, however absurd or uncontrollable they may be at times. Tourette Syndrome is real and sometimes it's funny and that's okay. But at least in this film, we're finally laughing at it for the right reasons. And with his portrayal, which also shows some of the positives that can come with Tourette - as opposed to just the obviously stare-inducing drawbacks - I am hopeful that this may help provide the less-aware with a better, more informed presumption about this condition.\n\nAre there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and who are open about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. Like me. But I'm not Edward Norton. And are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and closeted about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. But they are also not Edward Norton.\n\nThe issue of roles going to actors who don't live with the condition being portrayed has been a hot-button issue for many, and I do think there are instances where the role should have gone to someone else. This isn't one of those times. Actors are actors, after all - their job is to convince you that they're not pretending.\n\nEdward was convincing. And I - and I imagine a number of others with Tourette Syndrome who have been subject to unfair or illegal treatment due, at least in part, to a sub-par late '90s movie - thank him for being so. I was fortunate enough to see this at TIFF this year, where he introduced the film. Had he stayed for a Q&amp;A afterwards, I would have loved to have said this to him in person. But I doubt I am the first, and know I won't be the last, person to say this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't know why this wasn't just sold as some 1950s gangster series. The cast is amazing, great visuals and acting, but there is almost nothing supernatural about this! Which was kind of the entire point of Penny Dreadful. Aside from some dramatic walk-ons in a gorgeous leather gown from Dormer, and some odd side characters she somehow also needs to play, the supernatural aspect is completely missing. There is SO much that could have been done with the story. Disappointed because I was a huge fan of the original PD!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8473,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.\n\nWe were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)\n\nIt surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. "there will be no X in this family!" X being "instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\n\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them "mama, I miss you."\n\nBeautiful.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":410303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.\n\nWe were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)\n\nIt surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. "there will be no X in this family!" X being "instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\n\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them "mama, I miss you."\n\nBeautiful.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":410303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In this context, seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.\n\nParticular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts, the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision, studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory "shocker" ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly, director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline, but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes, a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh, as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably, but chiefly, my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loud-mouthed anti-hero category (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Snakes on a Plane), and on the other, his more nuanced (as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be) roles. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species. At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.\n\nTime-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films. The take assumes an interesting onset, depicting an apocalyptic future where machines lord over the human minority, but it spirals down to fatal loops of nonsensical uncreatively-staged retreads when the what can be considered the inception of human salvation (Schwarzenegger's Terminator's arrival), begins. Once the deadly cat-and-mouse chases spin out of control, confusion begins, and the film itself, can't be bothered to clear off heads as it totally busy itself to trying to awe-inspire spectators, with elaborately-constructed action setpieces, teeming with CGI-mastered explosions, pursuits, and fight scenes. There's no denying that such attempt is carried out with colossal success, but the audience would inevitably find appreciating the feat, difficult and pointless . The proceedings are sutured into recreations of some iconic scenes of the original movies, while also devising its own, at the same time. But even with all these efforts, GENISYS still fails to generate sustained interest. The result of its motives manages to hit some of the nostalgic beats of the franchise, but tepid one-liners and confusing paradoxes would drag down its capacity to last. It is also by these narrative defects that interest is being stripped off its key players, making the audience barely care about the characters and the imminence of their extinction. This is why Genisys is way below the glory of its predecessors--the dread is barely present, and fear is forced, thus ineffective.\n\nThere is a screaming irony that bursts at the heels of this attempt to reinvigorate the sagging Terminator series: The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns to the past to save the whole of humankind, but the mess that is GENISYS, murders the franchise. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":263503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species. At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.\n\nTime-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films. The take assumes an interesting onset, depicting an apocalyptic future where machines lord over the human minority, but it spirals down to fatal loops of nonsensical uncreatively-staged retreads when the what can be considered the inception of human salvation (Schwarzenegger's Terminator's arrival), begins. Once the deadly cat-and-mouse chases spin out of control, confusion begins, and the film itself, can't be bothered to clear off heads as it totally busy itself to trying to awe-inspire spectators, with elaborately-constructed action setpieces, teeming with CGI-mastered explosions, pursuits, and fight scenes. There's no denying that such attempt is carried out with colossal success, but the audience would inevitably find appreciating the feat, difficult and pointless . The proceedings are sutured into recreations of some iconic scenes of the original movies, while also devising its own, at the same time. But even with all these efforts, GENISYS still fails to generate sustained interest. The result of its motives manages to hit some of the nostalgic beats of the franchise, but tepid one-liners and confusing paradoxes would drag down its capacity to last. It is also by these narrative defects that interest is being stripped off its key players, making the audience barely care about the characters and the imminence of their extinction. This is why Genisys is way below the glory of its predecessors--the dread is barely present, and fear is forced, thus ineffective.\n\nThere is a screaming irony that bursts at the heels of this attempt to reinvigorate the sagging Terminator series: The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns to the past to save the whole of humankind, but the mess that is GENISYS, murders the franchise. 5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":263503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue.

But I don't really want to rehash everything that everybody else has said, want I want to do is express my disappointment in a majority of the fans.\n\n Back Off!!!  A lot of the comments on this site have been nothing more than whining and nit-picking about what Enterprise "isn't."  The concept of this show has apparently flown past your heads at warp 4.5!  This isn't Trek as we know it!  That is the point, the traditional Trek was a tired dog that was on it's last leg.  The idea here is to do something new, something different that we weren't ready for.  Stop analyzing what it should be, what it could be, and what it has already done wrong.\n\n For those of you who haven't yet seen it, I'm telling you that it is fantastic; it's thrilling, touching, funny, adventurous, and as interesting and curious as the original series.  But, when you watch it, go in with ABSOLUTELY no preconceived notions of what Trek is or what it should be. Berman and Braga have done exactly what they have set out to do and that is to reinvent Trek.\n\n And for those of you who apparently had to bite your lip through this, where the heck is YOUR sense of adventure.  We are seeing the BEGINNING of Star Trek! This is a dream come true!  I mean come on guys,  we got to witness the FIRST time they ever see a Klingon!! How cool is that.  If you would stop trying, endlessly to find something to complain about, you would find yourself enjoying little things like finding out where Kirk's famous speech "Space, the final frontier..." actually came from, or seeing how afraid they are of the transporters.  How you can not be slightly giddy seeing  Jonathan Archer pick up a "Phase Pistol" and ask, "What's this?" These are the nuggets that you are letting slip by because you have this notion that you know what is best for Star Trek.  I have loved all the series'( though Voyager is by far my least favorite) but it was time for something new.\n\n One last beef with the fans, lay off the theme song.  I think its wonderful.  This is another one of those preconceived notions we have of what Trek is supposed to be.  Yes, it is different than what we are used to, but if you stop judging and actually watch the images being shown and actually LISTEN to the words, you may find it slightly inspiring. Not to mention the fact that it is actually a very pretty song, that is, when you haven't already canned it because of being close minded.\n\nThis series is not about the continuation of Star Trek, it is about the beginning of mankind's exploration into deep space; this is why it isn't called Star Trek: Enterprise, but instead it is just Enterprise.  This is not the utopian society of past Trek shows.  These people are flawed, curious, impulsive, and very far from perfect.  They make many mistakes and that is their enduring charm.  They want this so bad and are just learning how to swim.  There are so many other things I loved, such as the grappler and the amazement of a pathetic warp 5, not to mention the fantastic cast and characters (Scott Bakula has always been a personal favorite of mine!,)but I just don't have room to go into detail.\n\n So on that note, stop shooting them down before they get going; I have a feeling its going to be one Hell of a ride!

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue. Whatever the future holds for the show the excellent Colin Morgan has a bright career ahead of him.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But I don't really want to rehash everything that everybody else has said, want I want to do is express my disappointment in a majority of the fans.\n\n Back Off!!!  A lot of the comments on this site have been nothing more than whining and nit-picking about what Enterprise "isn't."  The concept of this show has apparently flown past your heads at warp 4.5!  This isn't Trek as we know it!  That is the point, the traditional Trek was a tired dog that was on it's last leg.  The idea here is to do something new, something different that we weren't ready for.  Stop analyzing what it should be, what it could be, and what it has already done wrong.\n\n For those of you who haven't yet seen it, I'm telling you that it is fantastic; it's thrilling, touching, funny, adventurous, and as interesting and curious as the original series.  But, when you watch it, go in with ABSOLUTELY no preconceived notions of what Trek is or what it should be. Berman and Braga have done exactly what they have set out to do and that is to reinvent Trek.\n\n And for those of you who apparently had to bite your lip through this, where the heck is YOUR sense of adventure.  We are seeing the BEGINNING of Star Trek! This is a dream come true!  I mean come on guys,  we got to witness the FIRST time they ever see a Klingon!! How cool is that.  If you would stop trying, endlessly to find something to complain about, you would find yourself enjoying little things like finding out where Kirk's famous speech "Space, the final frontier..." actually came from, or seeing how afraid they are of the transporters.  How you can not be slightly giddy seeing  Jonathan Archer pick up a "Phase Pistol" and ask, "What's this?" These are the nuggets that you are letting slip by because you have this notion that you know what is best for Star Trek.  I have loved all the series'( though Voyager is by far my least favorite) but it was time for something new.\n\n One last beef with the fans, lay off the theme song.  I think its wonderful.  This is another one of those preconceived notions we have of what Trek is supposed to be.  Yes, it is different than what we are used to, but if you stop judging and actually watch the images being shown and actually LISTEN to the words, you may find it slightly inspiring. Not to mention the fact that it is actually a very pretty song, that is, when you haven't already canned it because of being close minded.\n\nThis series is not about the continuation of Star Trek, it is about the beginning of mankind's exploration into deep space; this is why it isn't called Star Trek: Enterprise, but instead it is just Enterprise.  This is not the utopian society of past Trek shows.  These people are flawed, curious, impulsive, and very far from perfect.  They make many mistakes and that is their enduring charm.  They want this so bad and are just learning how to swim.  There are so many other things I loved, such as the grappler and the amazement of a pathetic warp 5, not to mention the fantastic cast and characters (Scott Bakula has always been a personal favorite of mine!,)but I just don't have room to go into detail.\n\n So on that note, stop shooting them down before they get going; I have a feeling its going to be one Hell of a ride!  Let's Go!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48547,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"earth starship,earthling,terran,space explorer,earthman","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000836/","name":"Scott Bakula"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082517/","name":"John Billingsley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086883/","name":"Jolene Blalock"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094909/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053559/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103804/","name":"Brannon Braga"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Blu-Ray Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2275393049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A lot of the comments on this site have been nothing more than whining and nit-picking about what Enterprise "isn't."  The concept of this show has apparently flown past your heads at warp 4.5!  This isn't Trek as we know it!  That is the point, the traditional Trek was a tired dog that was on it's last leg.

Berman and Braga have done exactly what they have set out to do and that is to reinvent Trek.\n\n And for those of you who apparently had to bite your lip through this, where the heck is YOUR sense of adventure.  We are seeing the BEGINNING of Star Trek! This is a dream come true!  I mean come on guys,  we got to witness the FIRST time they ever see a Klingon!! How cool is that.  If you would stop trying, endlessly to find something to complain about, you would find yourself enjoying little things like finding out where Kirk's famous speech "Space, the final frontier..." actually came from, or seeing how afraid they are of the transporters.  How you can not be slightly giddy seeing  Jonathan Archer pick up a "Phase Pistol" and ask, "What's this?" These are the nuggets that you are letting slip by because you have this notion that you know what is best for Star Trek.  I have loved all the series'( though Voyager is by far my least favorite) but it was time for something new.\n\n One last beef with the fans, lay off the theme song.  I think its wonderful.  This is another one of those preconceived notions we have of what Trek is supposed to be.  Yes, it is different than what we are used to, but if you stop judging and actually watch the images being shown and actually LISTEN to the words, you may find it slightly inspiring. Not to mention the fact that it is actually a very pretty song, that is, when you haven't already canned it because of being close minded.\n\nThis series is not about the continuation of Star Trek, it is about the beginning of mankind's exploration into deep space; this is why it isn't called Star Trek: Enterprise, but instead it is just Enterprise.  This is not the utopian society of past Trek shows.  These people are flawed, curious, impulsive, and very far from perfect.  They make many mistakes and that is their enduring charm.  They want this so bad and are just learning how to swim.

They want this so bad and are just learning how to swim.  There are so many other things I loved, such as the grappler and the amazement of a pathetic warp 5, not to mention the fantastic cast and characters (Scott Bakula has always been a personal favorite of mine!,)but I just don't have room to go into detail.\n\n So on that note, stop shooting them down before they get going; I have a feeling its going to be one Hell of a ride!

The animation is perfect. it's bright, colourful and scarily lifelike. The characters, scenery and landscapes all look incredible and so creative. Even the opening credits look fantastic! I can't stress how good the visuals are in this film.\n\nTHE DIRECTION: Spielberg has done an incredible job here, nothing could have been improved in this aspect. The way the movie flows and the way the scenes intertwine and change is beautiful. There are scenes where it switches from past to present and back again in such a way that you just get lost in it.. you will understand what i mean when you see the movie. There are scenes of fights and chases which are so creative and so imaginative, the way he uses angles and the way everything links on is a real joy to watch. Its hard to explain, watch the film and you will know exactly what I mean.\n\nHowever, the film is not just a visual feast like many films are. It has a good solid story with likable, interesting characters - I found the story line kept my attention throughout. A very original adventure/quest film, searching for hidden treasure and defeating the bad guys along the way!\n\nI cannot recommend this film enough, i was so surprised by just how good it was. As i said earlier I am sorry I didn't go and see this in the cinema as it really would have been a fantastic experience. \n\nWatch it!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":220042,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This movie shows the impact of disappearance of a loved one suddenly &amp; without any sense of closure. The bereaved wife, Marie (played perfectly by the gorgeous Ms. Rampling) seems to be doing alright on the surface except for a few comments at a get together which make the viewers feel that she is having a hard time talking about her husband in past tense. We are a bit alarmed but that's the extent of it. However, when she returns to her home, we realize the utter &amp; extreme denial that fills every aspect of her life! It is horrifying &amp; saddening. That a beautiful, intelligent woman can have such a reaction is a clear reminder to us of humanity's fragility &amp; vulnerability when it comes to love. Losing a loved one is never easy. However, since humans are rational beings, it becomes much harder to come to terms with such a great loss in the absence of any plausible reason. So, not knowing exactly what happened to her husband was perhaps the biggest source of grief for Marie.\n\nThis is a very sincere look into the mind of a woman who seems to have lost a part of herself with the loss of her spouse. But I struggled with understanding the two men in Marie's life. Her husband's intentions were never fully revealed &amp; I'm kind of okay with that because that's the point of the story. However, the one that I really have a problem with is Vincent. Why this charming &amp; intelligent man got involved with Marie when she was not in a good place mentally is beyond me!\n\nThis movie has brought an epiphany to me. We must always consider the possibility that even though we may be perfectly happy &amp; content with someone, things may not be so good for them. And when we love that someone, it may become extremely hard for us to let go or even to understand how they could be unhappy in such a fulfilling relationship. But such is human nature. Sometimes, having been in long relationships, people evolve in different directions such that one partner may be very happy with the routine stuff while the other may be getting suffocated. One man's medicine is another man's poison, after all! And so, it may happen that one fine day, our loved one may want to walk out on us &amp; while it may hurt us, it might be their only salvation! We also need to consider the fact that some people may just be depressed &amp; at that point, it is pretty much out of our hands. All we can do in such circumstances is to be supportive &amp; hope for the best.\n\nLastly, this is one of those movies where you cannot have a spoiler in a review because the ending scene is open to everyone's personal interpretation &amp; for that, you need to see it yourself!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9953,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2001-02-07","keywords":"female frontal nudity,sex,male frontal nudity,female nudity,female masturbation","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001648/","name":"Charlotte Rampling"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0187337/","name":"Bruno Cremer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634500/","name":"Jacques Nolot"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654830/","name":"François Ozon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070053/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654830/","name":"François Ozon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0076814/","name":"Emmanuèle Bernheim"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888418/","name":"Marina de Van"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Wyraźnie nie pasuje on do środowiska pracowników fizycznych. W trosce o własną pozycję, zamierza trzymać dyscyplinę twardą ręką. Nagły wypadek, którego ofiarą staje się jeden z ukraińskich robotników, wystawia zasady moralne Krzysztofa na próbę. Zdaje on sobie sprawę z tego, że łatwo być stanowczym tylko w sprzyjających okolicznościach. Jednak trudno mu przeciwstawić się złu, kiedy w grę wchodzą dramatyczne konsekwencje.</desc>

Other than that, mentions go to Benoît Poelvoorde for his solid performance and Emmanuelle Devos as the sexy and self-assured Emilienne d'Alençon.\n\nOther than that, it's a solid biopic. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39540,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-04-22","keywords":"life of celebrity before becoming famous,social status,1920s,beach,wealth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2992290329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY0ODg1MTUtODNmNC00ZDUzLWI3YzEtNWU1OGM2ODNiZmQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY0ODg1MTUtODNmNC00ZDUzLWI3YzEtNWU1OGM2ODNiZmQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688143/","name":"Benoît Poelvoorde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284774/","name":"Anne Fontaine"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0254563/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212643/","name":"Edmonde Charles-Roux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284774/","name":"Anne Fontaine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1597664/","name":"Camille Fontaine"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
