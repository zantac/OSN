A lost opportunity.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-05-24","keywords":"nudity,female nudity,bare breasts,sex scene,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sibyl","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3410673177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMmNhN2UtOWQ4MC00NGE1LTkzZTEtNmUzZTE3N2U3MDExXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMmNhN2UtOWQ4MC00NGE1LTkzZTEtNmUzZTE3N2U3MDExXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1812637/","name":"Virginie Efira","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2650819/","name":"Adèle Exarchopoulos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0880484/","name":"Gaspard Ulliel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2630323/","name":"Justine Triet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0275730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258767/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1932959/","name":"Arthur Harari","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1797444/","name":"David H.

Despite such potentially-thoughtful commentary, it's not clear by the end of the film what Corbet really wants to say or offer as a message to the narrative besides simply saying that excess tackiness is bad. While superficiality is an important topic, for a film that poses far deeper, existential and angst-filled questions, the film's attempts to thread loose ends of its messaging before the film's finale (a pop concert) feel somewhat skimpy.

The plot synopsis might sound like a horror movie, but it's a drama, could be a TV movie of the week (back when that was a thing): John's addicted, watch his life fall apart, albeit in unusual circumstances. Never mind that his addiction is a doozy that no suburban rehab is going to fix, the potentially novel setup rapidly becomes melodramatic. The story so desperately wants to say something but in the end just meanders through the paces-John not knowing what to do, his friends not helping him, and help coming from the wrong places.\n\nThis movie has decent resources-budget, cast, locations-and does so little with it. Many of the set designs were poor, the costuming was off, the characters were unbelievable because the actors had so little to work with. The poster boasts a "special appearance by Mischa Barton" that's nothing special; her agent must've gotten her a hell of a deal for that billing. This must've seemed like a promising project but it just never came together. It was nice to see Madeline Zima from Californication in another role, too bad it was in this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-04-12","keywords":"death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Painkillers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi740276761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRlODc3ZTQtOTg1MS00MWUzLWE5MmUtNWFlODE1MWQxN2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRlODc3ZTQtOTg1MS00MWUzLWE5MmUtNWFlODE1MWQxN2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956526/","name":"Madeline Zima"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059215/","name":"Mischa Barton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1303594/","name":"Naomi Grossman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4367428/","name":"Roxy Shih"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0471241/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0396761/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1899712/","name":"Giles Daoust"}],"duration":"PT1H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The plot synopsis might sound like a horror movie, but it's a drama, could be a TV movie of the week (back when that was a thing): John's addicted, watch his life fall apart, albeit in unusual circumstances. Never mind that his addiction is a doozy that no suburban rehab is going to fix, the potentially novel setup rapidly becomes melodramatic. The story so desperately wants to say something but in the end just meanders through the paces-John not knowing what to do, his friends not helping him, and help coming from the wrong places.\n\nThis movie has decent resources-budget, cast, locations-and does so little with it. Many of the set designs were poor, the costuming was off, the characters were unbelievable because the actors had so little to work with. The poster boasts a "special appearance by Mischa Barton" that's nothing special; her agent must've gotten her a hell of a deal for that billing. This must've seemed like a promising project but it just never came together. It was nice to see Madeline Zima from Californication in another role, too bad it was in this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-04-12","keywords":"death","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Painkillers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi740276761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRlODc3ZTQtOTg1MS00MWUzLWE5MmUtNWFlODE1MWQxN2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRlODc3ZTQtOTg1MS00MWUzLWE5MmUtNWFlODE1MWQxN2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956526/","name":"Madeline Zima","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059215/","name":"Mischa Barton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1303594/","name":"Naomi Grossman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4367428/","name":"Roxy Shih"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0471241/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0396761/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1899712/","name":"Giles Daoust"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought it would be just another well-acted period drama. What I didn't know was that Todd Haynes was behind it, and from the opening the film lets you know what kind of style it will be. It's not one of those stuffy period dramas. In fact, it's very much made in the style of actual 1950s films. It's apparently taking on the style of Douglas Sirks' films, and even though I have never seen one, the style is apparent. \n\nThis is the definition of a melodrama, but it serves the purpose completely and not the type of melodrama you would expect in this day and age. Everything is heightened in it's intensity. The incredible cinematography and use of colors is something to marvel at, and in terms of how the cinematography was constructed I don't think any other film could compare to. The beautiful music score is perfect and it only makes the atmosphere richer. All of this serves as a backdrop to a film that's really about contemporary issues in the 50s. That in itself has been the focus of many films in the last few years, but Far From Heaven stands apart from them all. The screenplay is brilliantly written, infusing rich backgrounds and characterization to all of the characters. In fact, the plot is pretty straight-forward and something you would see in classic films of that era, but now it feels fresh, alive with excitement. It's never depressing, and instead it tells its story until a satisfying conclusion. It's probably one of the best screenplays of its decade.\n\nThe performances are also perfect. But Julianne Moore tops off this perfection. I was surprised by how little "big" scenes she has. I would have expected this film to, but then again that's just another surprise.

 --- Description: Far from Heaven: Directed by Todd Haynes. With Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid, Dennis Haysbert, Patricia Clarkson. In 1950s Connecticut, a flustered housewife faces a marital crisis and mounting racial tensions in the outside world." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0297884/","name":"Far from Heaven","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5ODI3MTM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjE5OTg2._V1_.jpg","description":"In 1950s Connecticut, a flustered housewife faces a marital crisis and mounting racial tensions in the outside world.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0297884/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Red_Identity","dateCreated":"2012-03-05","inLanguage":"English","name":"Incredible film with amazing ambition and visual style","reviewBody":"I decided to seek this one out because of Julianne Moore. I thought it would be just another well-acted period drama. What I didn't know was that Todd Haynes was behind it, and from the opening the film lets you know what kind of style it will be. It's not one of those stuffy period dramas. In fact, it's very much made in the style of actual 1950s films. It's apparently taking on the style of Douglas Sirks' films, and even though I have never seen one, the style is apparent. \n\nThis is the definition of a melodrama, but it serves the purpose completely and not the type of melodrama you would expect in this day and age. Everything is heightened in it's intensity. The incredible cinematography and use of colors is something to marvel at, and in terms of how the cinematography was constructed I don't think any other film could compare to. The beautiful music score is perfect and it only makes the atmosphere richer. All of this serves as a backdrop to a film that's really about contemporary issues in the 50s. That in itself has been the focus of many films in the last few years, but Far From Heaven stands apart from them all. The screenplay is brilliantly written, infusing rich backgrounds and characterization to all of the characters. In fact, the plot is pretty straight-forward and something you would see in classic films of that era, but now it feels fresh, alive with excitement. It's never depressing, and instead it tells its story until a satisfying conclusion. It's probably one of the best screenplays of its decade.\n\nThe performances are also perfect. But Julianne Moore tops off this perfection. I was surprised by how little "big" scenes she has. I would have expected this film to, but then again that's just another surprise. She embodies this character completely, and now that we have all of these flawed and unlikable leads, here we have one who we can easily call a "hero". Someone who others could look up to, we instantly connect with Moore. \n\nOverall, Far From Heaven is the 2nd Haynes film I have seen (the other being I'm Not There), and still his ambition is as apparent as ever. This feels as unique of a film as one could hope for.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45596,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-05-07","keywords":"gossip,homosexual,gay kiss,hate crime,domestic violence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Far From Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2359689497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyMmEwOTUtOTk1Yi00YTU0LTg2YjktOTUzZTMwODJkOTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyMmEwOTUtOTk1Yi00YTU0LTg2YjktOTUzZTMwODJkOTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371660/","name":"Dennis Haysbert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042766/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

How would anyone know that it was hidden behind a painting?  Well that, and most of the other details of this film, is never explained.  For example, why would an art museum be loaded up with 55-gallon drums of gasoline, so that when it is torched as a diversion to stealing the painting, they could explode like rockets?  And for that matter, with all the exploding and flames everywhere, the painting should have been burnt to a crisp before anyone had a chance to swipe it.  But this is supposed to be a thriller, so all the absurd pyrotechnics of the beginning were evidently thought necessary to startle the twelve-year-olds in the audience.\n\nAfter that as an introduction, the basic idea is that there are no good guys, just varying degrees of bad guys and bystanders, who end up chasing after a lost treasure.  Never mind that one is a cop and another a government agent, sworn to an oath to serve the public, and hence any treasure they might discover as a result of doing their jobs would more correctly belong to the people they serve.  In other words, the basic message of this film is that serving the public might be fine in theory, but when the potential for feathering one's nest with a vast fortune gets involved, best to take the money and run.  No wonder the current generation has so little faith in public servants.  When they go to the movies, they see them portrayed as only marginally less greedy than the crooks.\n\nThis is a shameful story, which promotes the view that no matter how you end up with the loot, it is yours to keep and enjoy.  The bad guys, who want to keep it all for themselves, must first be knocked out of course, after which the `good' guys get to divide the hoard.  And the reason why they are `different' from the crooks is because they are less `violently' motivated by greed.  In other words, if avarice is pursued less violently, perhaps more humanely, then it's okay.  In any case, what matters is that you end up with the prize.  Having the money is more important that how you got it. That, unfortunately, is the message of this story, and it is as harmful to the fabric of society as it could possibly be.

(played oh-so-well by Ted Danson) We see the standard group of small town guys, going nowhere with their lives, yet they aren't the stereotypical unrelatable morons of modern day cinema; They, in a very round about and strange way, have morals and try to do well in life, despite their position.

It gives us a story we recognize to a certain extent, but garnishes it with a great variety of endearing characters. As an example the group of "guys" has a wonderfully accepted gay guy who asked the guys to call him MOOSE. (played oh-so-well by Ted Danson) We see the standard group of small town guys, going nowhere with their lives, yet they aren't the stereotypical unrelatable morons of modern day cinema; They, in a very round about and strange way, have morals and try to do well in life, despite their position. Go see this movie... it is a wonderful treat and a great time at the theatre.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6326,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-04-28","keywords":"small town,loser,adult filmmaking,pornographic film,hot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Amateurs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2207580441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJkZDkwNzktZDNiMS00NzFhLThhYTktM2FhZDg5ODQ2ZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJkZDkwNzktZDNiMS00NzFhLThhYTktM2FhZDg5ODQ2ZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Amateurs","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001101/","name":"Ted Danson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001592/","name":"Joe Pantoliano"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870592/","name":"Michael Traeger"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010508/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870592/","name":"Michael Traeger"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A scientist, Susan Tyler, breeds a new bug that mimics the cockroach and wipes out the disease.  However years later something is living in New York's subways that looks human.   Tyler suspects that her breed has not died out but has evolved to imitate it's natural predator - us.  Her investigations into the subway lead her to more than she bargained for.\n\nThis is an atmospheric thriller from Guillermo del Toro, director of The Devil's Backbone and Cronos.  He manages to mix great director with good old fashioned monster horror to great effect.  The concept itself is clever, even if the idea of bugs evolving to look very like humans is a little far fetched.  However, once the action moves to the subway the fact that the bugs are clearly lethal no matter what they look like, makes this less important.  The film is quite short and makes the action come quicker and seem more urgent.  Several people get killed by the bug that wouldn't usually get killed in this sort of horror (children for example), this is very effective as it is quite scary to see the unexpected happen.\n\nThe mood is dark throughout and Del Toro uses the sewers and subway to great effect, creating a real sense of claustrophobia - like the humans have entered the bug's world and not the other way round.  The bugs are shown early on in the film - usually not a good idea (keep it hidden in the Jaws way), but here the special effects are good enough to make the bug really believable.  However the horror is not in seeing the bugs but in they way they hunt and kill - the fear is in what could happen.

A scientist, Susan Tyler, breeds a new bug that mimics the cockroach and wipes out the disease.  However years later something is living in New York's subways that looks human.   Tyler suspects that her breed has not died out but has evolved to imitate it's natural predator - us.  Her investigations into the subway lead her to more than she bargained for.\n\nThis is an atmospheric thriller from Guillermo del Toro, director of The Devil's Backbone and Cronos.  He manages to mix great director with good old fashioned monster horror to great effect.  The concept itself is clever, even if the idea of bugs evolving to look very like humans is a little far fetched.  However, once the action moves to the subway the fact that the bugs are clearly lethal no matter what they look like, makes this less important.  The film is quite short and makes the action come quicker and seem more urgent.  Several people get killed by the bug that wouldn't usually get killed in this sort of horror (children for example), this is very effective as it is quite scary to see the unexpected happen.\n\nThe mood is dark throughout and Del Toro uses the sewers and subway to great effect, creating a real sense of claustrophobia - like the humans have entered the bug's world and not the other way round.  The bugs are shown early on in the film - usually not a good idea (keep it hidden in the Jaws way), but here the special effects are good enough to make the bug really believable.  However the horror is not in seeing the bugs but in they way they hunt and kill - the fear is in what could happen.  That's why seeing them doesn't take anything away.\n\nThe cast are great, Sorvino especially is very good in the lead.  Jeremy Northam and Charles S. Dutton are good in support and Abraham Murray adds a bit of cameo class (though his role is quite unnecessary).  But the director is the real star adding some genuine scares and real mood to a film that could have easily been just another creature-feature that goes straight to video and straight to the back of your mind.\n\nOverall a superior creature horror film.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1997-08-22","keywords":"giant insect,insect,disease,entomologist,cockroach","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mimic","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3387923993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMyYmE4YzktNWMwMy00NmVkLThiMDQtYTU0Yzc4OTc1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMyYmE4YzktNWMwMy00NmVkLThiMDQtYTU0Yzc4OTc1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000227/","name":"Mira Sorvino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000562/","name":"Jeremy Northam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329422/","name":"Alexander Goodwin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0938586/","name":"Donald A.

    <title lang="en">Shooting for Socrates</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Shooting for Socrates: Directed by James Erskine. With John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson. In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - "a fee for this and a fee for that") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - "the next George Best". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the "top of the World" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the sociopolitical backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best.

Appropriate because Charlotte (Wynona Ryder), like the nation, is about to shed a little of her innocence and face some difficult realities.  Cher, Ryder and an adorably young Christina Ricci are perfect as a single parent family.  Cher, in her best work ever, including Moonstruck, is a free-spirited mom who only cooks finger food because anything else is too much of a commitment.  Ryder, who narrates the film from her character's perspective, is a high school student who, despite her fervent wish to lead a devout life, falls in love with the local handyman.  Ricci is the youngest, a champion swimmer who steals the whole movie with scenes like her pumpkin scene. (Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's unforgettable.) Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the shoe salesman who falls head over heels for Cher, family and all.\n\nSet in coastal Massachusetts, the scenery is breathtaking, and the idyllic depiction of life in a small town in the last days of American innocence is dead on.

Appropriate because Charlotte (Wynona Ryder), like the nation, is about to shed a little of her innocence and face some difficult realities.  Cher, Ryder and an adorably young Christina Ricci are perfect as a single parent family.  Cher, in her best work ever, including Moonstruck, is a free-spirited mom who only cooks finger food because anything else is too much of a commitment.  Ryder, who narrates the film from her character's perspective, is a high school student who, despite her fervent wish to lead a devout life, falls in love with the local handyman.  Ricci is the youngest, a champion swimmer who steals the whole movie with scenes like her pumpkin scene. (Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's unforgettable.) Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the shoe salesman who falls head over heels for Cher, family and all.\n\nSet in coastal Massachusetts, the scenery is breathtaking, and the idyllic depiction of life in a small town in the last days of American innocence is dead on.  Director Richard Benjamin, who also gave us such charming films as Milk Money and My Stepmother is an Alien, rivals Penny Marshall and Rob Reiner with this gem.\n\nThis film is perfection, an absolute 10.  It's a magic potion that can make me laugh and feel good even on the worst day.  I sometimes wish I could step inside a la Pleasantville and stay there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1990-12-14","keywords":"single mother,swimming pool,year 1964,female protagonist,teenage girl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4065770265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2I5MmM5YzAtOGYxZS00Y2YxLWIxZjUtMTliNjFkNGFlODNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2I5MmM5YzAtOGYxZS00Y2YxLWIxZjUtMTliNjFkNGFlODNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000333/","name":"Cher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001364/","name":"Bob Hoskins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000213/","name":"Winona Ryder"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000907/","name":"Richard Benjamin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001995/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200351/","name":"Patty Dann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0731293/","name":"June Roberts"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I have read comments from users saying that this movie "didn't seem real" or "wasn't believable". To you, I ask: What did you think you were watching? I saw this screening at the Newport Film Festival and thought it was amazing. Some movies (gasp) are out there to entertain and this does just that... fantastically. It is a story that laughs at the ups and downs of the human experience while portraying the sometimes very harsh reality of middle-class struggle. It gives us a story we recognize to a certain extent, but garnishes it with a great variety of endearing characters.

I saw this screening at the Newport Film Festival and thought it was amazing. Some movies (gasp) are out there to entertain and this does just that... fantastically. It is a story that laughs at the ups and downs of the human experience while portraying the sometimes very harsh reality of middle-class struggle. It gives us a story we recognize to a certain extent, but garnishes it with a great variety of endearing characters.

Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I missed the theatrical run completely. I then became hooked on Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time - so I said "oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it." Soon, I recognized Keith David, and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.\n\nThis is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.\n\nThe film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.\n\nThe film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.\n\nAs unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":232514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"darkness,desert,eclipse,survival,spaceship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pitch Black","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi15073561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYzFiZDMtZTUwZi00ZWVlLTg1OTQtODA3NWQ4MDIwNjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYzFiZDMtZTUwZi00ZWVlLTg1OTQtODA3NWQ4MDIwNjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593664/","name":"Radha Mitchell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0369513/","name":"Cole Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004874/","name":"Vin Diesel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878638/","name":"David Twohy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923646/","name":"Jim Wheat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003117/","name":"Ken Wheat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878638/","name":"David Twohy"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.\n\nThis is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.\n\nThe film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.\n\nThe film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.\n\nAs unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":232514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"darkness,desert,eclipse,survival,spaceship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pitch Black","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi15073561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYzFiZDMtZTUwZi00ZWVlLTg1OTQtODA3NWQ4MDIwNjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYzFiZDMtZTUwZi00ZWVlLTg1OTQtODA3NWQ4MDIwNjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593664/","name":"Radha Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0369513/","name":"Cole Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004874/","name":"Vin Diesel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878638/","name":"David Twohy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923646/","name":"Jim Wheat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003117/","name":"Ken Wheat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878638/","name":"David Twohy"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There's a spooky faceless monster that has been haunting the daughter of John Farrow (Clive Owen). This figure wants to steal her face as she feels he has no identity of his own . John's tried helping his daughter remedy the situation, but each night she still gets a visit from this unwelcomed friend. Things get even spookier once John sees this faceless creature. He's not sure if he's going completely crazy or not, so he installs a security camera . Though no one can see him , Hollow Face lurks in the corners, desperately desiring love but only knowing how to spread fear and hate. He creeps into the life of John Farrow after Farrow's beloved 13-year-old daughter Mia (Ella Purnell) is assaulted in their home . The line between the real and the imaginary blurs as fissures start to open within the family unit . It seems that no security measure can keep Hollow Face out .

It has a couple of twists piled on top of one central twist concerning two children in different countries who are visited nightly by a faceless being and menaced by what seems to be a supernatural presence . Good performance by Clive Owen who stars as John Farrow, a father trying to protect his 13-year-old daughter from the evil entity known as Hollow Face . The acting from Clive Owen , Carice van Houten as his wife , Daniel Bruhl as a priest , Kerry Fox as a Doctor , Hector Alterio as an old priest is much better than the script . Nicolás Casariego and Jaime Marques' screenplay does something strange by the end : it actually removes the stakes of everything that came before with its trio of revelations that at first test and then demolish any credulity the movie had built up by that point.

The plot draws heavily from "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Safe House," with a lot of familiar tropes seen in dozens of genre films. What few mild surprises the plot offers generally happen off-screen, although it is not easy to predict which characters will die, who will kill whom and the order of their demises. The biggest surprise seems borrowed from "Showdown in Little Tokyo" and is surprising only because the film hadn't yet developed the characters – although, to their credit, it is a great improvement on the SILT scene. The bad guys who are really good and the good guys who are really bad could have simply worn T- shirts identifying themselves. The dialogue alternates between pretentious, execrable, familiar and unnecessary. Production values are generally adequate, although marred by over-reliance on distracting jiggly-cam shots. \n\nHowever, the fight scenes are capably executed. Michael Jai White is highly proficient and other cast members demonstrate considerable skill as well, including Marsden, Zagorsky, Jaeger and Palicki. The fight choreography is competent, although uninspired. The special effects incorporated into the numerous gun battles are handled well. \n\nAdvocates of diversity in films should be encouraged by the ethnically diverse cast.

The plot draws heavily from "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Safe House," with a lot of familiar tropes seen in dozens of genre films. What few mild surprises the plot offers generally happen off-screen, although it is not easy to predict which characters will die, who will kill whom and the order of their demises. The biggest surprise seems borrowed from "Showdown in Little Tokyo" and is surprising only because the film hadn't yet developed the characters – although, to their credit, it is a great improvement on the SILT scene. The bad guys who are really good and the good guys who are really bad could have simply worn T- shirts identifying themselves. The dialogue alternates between pretentious, execrable, familiar and unnecessary. Production values are generally adequate, although marred by over-reliance on distracting jiggly-cam shots. \n\nHowever, the fight scenes are capably executed. Michael Jai White is highly proficient and other cast members demonstrate considerable skill as well, including Marsden, Zagorsky, Jaeger and Palicki. The fight choreography is competent, although uninspired. The special effects incorporated into the numerous gun battles are handled well. \n\nAdvocates of diversity in films should be encouraged by the ethnically diverse cast. However, skeptics will note that most of the Asian, Hispanic and black performers are in background roles and underutilized. The director seems to have attempted to give a couple of them more screen time with prolonged noble demises, but the shots seem more distracting than empowering. White delivers his dialogue with a heavy accent and another character is given an urban 'tude, but as in many films with large casts, the diversity seems more a result of casting decisions than screen writing choices.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-08-01","keywords":"sequel,2010s,washington state,washington,pacific northwest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"S.W.A.T.: Under Siege","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3058612249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmNjNhODYtOGUzMC00MDY5LTk2ZWUtOGIyMTI2MWNhYmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmNjNhODYtOGUzMC00MDY5LTk2ZWUtOGIyMTI2MWNhYmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415382/","name":"Sam Jaeger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1597316/","name":"Adrianne Palicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0925220/","name":"Michael Jai White"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317638/","name":"Tony Giglio"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1396586/","name":"Jonas Barnes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2600276/","name":"Keith Domingue"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film really lives and breathes nostalgia of its predecessor, as well as showing how, even if we all change on the outside, we are still the same on the insides. We all make the same choices in life over and over.\n\nMy only complaint with this film is that it didn't feel as slick as the first film. This is probably because of the vast improvements in cinematography which you'd expect considering there's an over 20 year age gap. Transitional shots mean you're waiting that little bit longer, but you are probably looking at some of the best views Scotland has to offer in that time.\n\nTo sum up, I'd have to say this film is essential viewing for anybody who's seen the first film or read the books. There are so many references which you'll pick up on, leaving you with a wry and joyous smile throughout. For anyone else, you need to watch the original film first (and understand Scottish for anyone reading not in the UK), but I assure you that this film will not disappoint.

The film really lives and breathes nostalgia of its predecessor, as well as showing how, even if we all change on the outside, we are still the same on the insides. We all make the same choices in life over and over.\n\nMy only complaint with this film is that it didn't feel as slick as the first film. This is probably because of the vast improvements in cinematography which you'd expect considering there's an over 20 year age gap. Transitional shots mean you're waiting that little bit longer, but you are probably looking at some of the best views Scotland has to offer in that time.\n\nTo sum up, I'd have to say this film is essential viewing for anybody who's seen the first film or read the books. There are so many references which you'll pick up on, leaving you with a wry and joyous smile throughout. For anyone else, you need to watch the original film first (and understand Scottish for anyone reading not in the UK), but I assure you that this film will not disappoint. It's textbook Danny Boyle packed full of nostalgia","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119581,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-01-27","keywords":"old friends reunited,sequel,drugs,homecoming,prostitute","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Legacy Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3395794457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMwZGRlZjItZjI1Yi00NDc1LWJjOTMtZTRiZTdlZWI4YmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMwZGRlZjItZjI1Yi00NDc1LWJjOTMtZTRiZTdlZWI4YmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"First there was an opportunity......then there was a betrayal.\n \nTwenty years have gone by.

I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.\n\nScott's movie is quite brave in that it has no major stars and no central character (unlike, say Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or Mel Gibson in WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS). It's also largely free of the clichés of the genre: no soaring John Williams score accompanying shots of the flag fluttering in the sunlight; no scenes of the families back home. Instead its all about the logistics and the absolute horror of battle. This is the best combat footage since ZULU way back in 1964, a film which it resembles. In Scott's commentary description words, it is 'Anti-War but pro-military'.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":379572,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. army,gunfight,peacekeeper,chaos","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.\n\nScott's movie is quite brave in that it has no major stars and no central character (unlike, say Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or Mel Gibson in WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS). It's also largely free of the clichés of the genre: no soaring John Williams score accompanying shots of the flag fluttering in the sunlight; no scenes of the families back home. Instead its all about the logistics and the absolute horror of battle. This is the best combat footage since ZULU way back in 1964, a film which it resembles. In Scott's commentary description words, it is 'Anti-War but pro-military'.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":379572,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. army,gunfight,peacekeeper,chaos","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother.

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics.

As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0443272/","name":"Lincoln","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzczMDUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2ODEzOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0443272/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"StevePulaski","dateCreated":"2012-11-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity","reviewBody":"Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

Anna Cieslak gives a strong performance as the fated Mariola, a young Polish girl, who's leaves her home looking for a brighter future, but ends up being delivered into the hands of devils.\n\nCieslak's performance is the strongest part of the movie. As a film it's competently realised, but also feels a little vacuous, although that same feeling works well alongside Cieslak's character, whom understandably is losing her self to the tortures she is forced into.\n\nAs with Lilja 4-Ever, Masz Na Imie Justine is an important film, that warns us of the evil that man can inflict, and it is a horror that is sadly all too real.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":479,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pig,slaughterhouse,toasting with a drink,drinking vodka,male female relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1752088/","name":"Anna Cieslak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295823/","name":"Arno Frisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533650/","name":"Rafal Mackowiak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143581/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121022/","name":"Chris Burdza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1268993/","name":"Tomasz Kepski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

Some folks in his homeland (including some politicians) have criticized his films for exposing these problem....though many film buffs have loved these same films.

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Now, I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the "magic" of a certain movie if they refuse to see it, or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director, writer, or whatever. But after reading such lines as "if you liked this film, you know nothing about film" and so on, I simply couldn't contain myself.\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the "culture" that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or "hard", as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words: I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wife-beating and all around socially retarded mentality, I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But, after a time, I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it, at least to give it a chance. I popped it in, and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.\n\nFor those who've not yet seen the film, I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit, a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother, miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up (in a trailer park, barely able to make rent or take care of herself). Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's best ally and, in some ways, his father figure; playing the role of the protective, guidance providing, loving role-model. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as, through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness, he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to; nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems, he starts to see his path better and more clearly.\n\nNow, I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere, where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life, feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard, and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm; as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened, and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead, a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story, importance of cinematic elements throughout a story (i.e.: not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it), and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past, and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life, and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.\n\nTo close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.\n\nSee this movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-11-08","keywords":"self expression,competition,rap music,hip hop,proles","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"8 Mile","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi615776537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "March 18th""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004896/","name":"Eminem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106989/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798788/","name":"Scott Silver"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now, I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the "magic" of a certain movie if they refuse to see it, or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director, writer, or whatever. But after reading such lines as "if you liked this film, you know nothing about film" and so on, I simply couldn't contain myself.\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the "culture" that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or "hard", as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words: I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wife-beating and all around socially retarded mentality, I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But, after a time, I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it, at least to give it a chance. I popped it in, and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.\n\nFor those who've not yet seen the film, I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit, a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother, miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up (in a trailer park, barely able to make rent or take care of herself). Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's best ally and, in some ways, his father figure; playing the role of the protective, guidance providing, loving role-model. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as, through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness, he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to; nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems, he starts to see his path better and more clearly.\n\nNow, I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere, where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life, feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard, and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm; as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened, and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead, a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story, importance of cinematic elements throughout a story (i.e.: not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it), and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past, and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life, and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.\n\nTo close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.\n\nSee this movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-11-08","keywords":"self expression,competition,rap music,hip hop,proles","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"8 Mile","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi615776537","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "March 18th"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004896/","name":"Eminem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106989/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798788/","name":"Scott Silver"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

This movie aims for there, but gets bogged in a swamp outside moscow.\n\nI wish i could file criminal charges against the production team because the way they managed to destroy such a captivating character should be criminal. Kretzsky, of course is who i am getting at. The potential setup of him was brilliant but it fizzled out into nothing. Then, about 3/4 of the movie in, his character gets a chance of redemption. And what does the movie do? Just absolutely nothing. If you do not get angered by how they threw away all their characters away you did not watch this movie.\n\nThe scenery was nice, the sets well made, the real life element capture was close to that of schindler's list. And that's all this movie has for it! All the raw emotion, personal struggle, complex relationships all the things they could have focused on in a movie about siberia (where NOTHING happens) they didnt. Instead it is just one scene of build up after another, then fizzle, then more of the same. No follow through, no culmination, no emotion.\n\nAt the end i couldn't care if any of them survived. The complete failure of this crew to attach the viewer to what should have been a sad tale of struggle cannot be forgiven.\n\nAnd to further insult us, of course the propaganda message before titles roll just had to be there, because let's face it. Unless you literally typed it on the screen, nobody would have grasped what this was even about. It was that bad.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"communism,deportation,soviet union,political repression,rape attempt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ashes in the Snow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi372423193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2525790/","name":"Bel Powley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2966840/","name":"Lisa Loven Kongsli"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909412/","name":"Martin Wallström"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2101256/","name":"Marius A.

This movie aims for there, but gets bogged in a swamp outside moscow.\n\nI wish i could file criminal charges against the production team because the way they managed to destroy such a captivating character should be criminal. Kretzsky, of course is who i am getting at. The potential setup of him was brilliant but it fizzled out into nothing. Then, about 3/4 of the movie in, his character gets a chance of redemption. And what does the movie do? Just absolutely nothing. If you do not get angered by how they threw away all their characters away you did not watch this movie.\n\nThe scenery was nice, the sets well made, the real life element capture was close to that of schindler's list. And that's all this movie has for it! All the raw emotion, personal struggle, complex relationships all the things they could have focused on in a movie about siberia (where NOTHING happens) they didnt. Instead it is just one scene of build up after another, then fizzle, then more of the same. No follow through, no culmination, no emotion.\n\nAt the end i couldn't care if any of them survived. The complete failure of this crew to attach the viewer to what should have been a sad tale of struggle cannot be forgiven.\n\nAnd to further insult us, of course the propaganda message before titles roll just had to be there, because let's face it. Unless you literally typed it on the screen, nobody would have grasped what this was even about. It was that bad.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"communism,deportation,soviet union,political repression,rape attempt","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ashes in the Snow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi372423193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2525790/","name":"Bel Powley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2966840/","name":"Lisa Loven Kongsli","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909412/","name":"Martin Wallström"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2101256/","name":"Marius A.

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire.

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire.

Within four days, hundreds of traces were found across the city, and, just when things were finally thought to be under control, a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent was discovered, throwing the investigation into renewed chaos."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Czy na pewno umiesz gotować?</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Mistrzowie domowej kuchni poznają prawdę o swoim kulinarnym talencie. Bohaterem każdego odcinka jest osoba zgłoszona przez rodzinę. Każdy myśli, że został wybrany ze względu na swoje zdolności. Tymczasem okazuje się, że bliscy mają już dość przesolonej lasagne, mdłej pomidorówki lub twardych schabowych, ale boją się powiedzieć to wprost kucharzowi amatorowi. Znany szef kuchni Andrzej Polan ocenia umiejętności swoich gości i pomaga im podszkolić się w trudnej sztuce gotowania.</desc>

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0443272/","name":"Lincoln","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzczMDUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2ODEzOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0443272/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"StevePulaski","dateCreated":"2012-11-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity","reviewBody":"Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

As a film it's competently realised, but also feels a little vacuous, although that same feeling works well alongside Cieslak's character, whom understandably is losing her self to the tortures she is forced into.\n\nAs with Lilja 4-Ever, Masz Na Imie Justine is an important film, that warns us of the evil that man can inflict, and it is a horror that is sadly all too real.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":479,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pig,slaughterhouse,toasting with a drink,drinking vodka,male female relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1752088/","name":"Anna Cieslak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295823/","name":"Arno Frisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533650/","name":"Rafal Mackowiak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143581/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121022/","name":"Chris Burdza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1268993/","name":"Tomasz Kepski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

But what I want to say after seeing it was 1/see the first film 2/read the book.

From its first opening shot to its last frame, there is such lyricism and emotion and beauty that it almost leaves you speechless. I have not seen this movie in years, but it still affects me and I want to write about it. There is a pervading sadness to the movie, like a memory of something wonderful that could have been, that should have been, that almost was, and is all the more tragic because it was in your hands but slipped through your fingers. This is not a movie for everyone, but if you believe that film can be one of the highest forms of art, this is the film to see.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not being a banker or someone who is detached from human interaction in general, it is not easy to fully identify with the main character here. And there are flaws or at least weird decisions along the way ... but it is a comedy and it tries to be as funny as it can be overall.\n\nThat out of the way, I had no idea what the movie would be like or any story element, so color me shocked and surprised by the inciting incident at the start of the movie.

Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise.

So he goes to a remote island to learn a whistling language that will allow him to communicate with the criminals from a distance. There he rekindles a relationship with his old flame and his priorities change. As both the criminals and his colleagues are onto Cristi what choices will he make to come out clean of his predicament? A clever game of cops and robbers ensues.\n\nSumming up this multi layered, not always coherent plot, is not an easy task. THE WHISTLERS takes a long time to get going but it's many elements come together building up to something special. Heavy on movie references it is heavily inspired by Tarantino movies, although the style of the cinematography is rather dull.\n\nThe script on paper must look great, but this is the case where a writer should let go of his work and let someone else direct. Cornelliu Porumboiu helmed 13 films but seems to be still searching for his directing style. While all the cast do their job well, the motives of their characters for the majority of the film are obscure to say the least.\n\nBut if this is the originality you are looking for THE WHISTLERS is for you. With good timing and a genuine sense of wit it is a rewarding experience for those who will stick with it until the end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"female rear nudity,canary islands,police detective,policeman,police officer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1044168473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412096/","name":"Vlad Ivanov"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5054840/","name":"Catrinel Marlon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120715/","name":"Rodica Lazar"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0180401/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245364/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So he goes to a remote island to learn a whistling language that will allow him to communicate with the criminals from a distance. There he rekindles a relationship with his old flame and his priorities change. As both the criminals and his colleagues are onto Cristi what choices will he make to come out clean of his predicament? A clever game of cops and robbers ensues.\n\nSumming up this multi layered, not always coherent plot, is not an easy task. THE WHISTLERS takes a long time to get going but it's many elements come together building up to something special. Heavy on movie references it is heavily inspired by Tarantino movies, although the style of the cinematography is rather dull.\n\nThe script on paper must look great, but this is the case where a writer should let go of his work and let someone else direct. Cornelliu Porumboiu helmed 13 films but seems to be still searching for his directing style. While all the cast do their job well, the motives of their characters for the majority of the film are obscure to say the least.\n\nBut if this is the originality you are looking for THE WHISTLERS is for you. With good timing and a genuine sense of wit it is a rewarding experience for those who will stick with it until the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"female rear nudity,canary islands,police detective,policeman,police officer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1044168473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412096/","name":"Vlad Ivanov","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5054840/","name":"Catrinel Marlon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120715/","name":"Rodica Lazar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0180401/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245364/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

T. has come home again in a different form with much less fanfare, yet every child has to love the anarchy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15365,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-01-30","keywords":"father son relationship,bullying,lollipop,china,cockroach","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. trailer: CJ7","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991377177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzE5ODg5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkwMjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzE5ODg5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkwMjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the U.S. theatrical trailer for CJ7, directed by Stephen Chow.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2514879/","name":"Yuqi Zhang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2922341/","name":"Jiao Xu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020819/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049799/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0463674/","name":"Vincent Kok","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A challenge comes in the shapely form of Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta Jones) who wants to marry (or preferably divorce) her way to riches. With Clooney hired to represent her soon to be ex husband, he inevitably falls for the gold diggers charms.\n\nDirected by the Coen brothers, a directorial team who have helmed oddball comedies such as 'Fargo' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' this is the team's first branch in to a high profile Hollywood film. Clooney, as the sharp suited lawyer, is excellent. Like Cary Grant or David Niven, Clooney is able to mock himself without compensating his screen appeal. Catherine Zeta Jones as the money hungry Marilyn is as sexy as her character demands from the scripted page. However, despite the quick fire dialogue, Intolerable Cruelty is simply not as funny as it thinks, it's cynical message of love and money taking away the romantic push it needs to place it in the league of the Tracy/Hepburn films the movie aspires to. Clooney's character also suffers from an over enthusiastic plot that later drives his character to attempt to commit a crime that totally contradicts the audiences perception of him. A battle of the sexes comedy that has sex appeal but no romance, Intolerable Cruelty is a film that reaches for the golden age of Hollywood but only touches the bronze."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-12-24","keywords":"woman wears eyeglasses,strong female character,lake tahoe,reference to henry viii,deception","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Intolerable Cruelty","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi781320473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000671/","name":"Billy Bob Thornton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0709070/","name":"Robert Ramsey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0832043/","name":"Matthew Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738908/","name":"John Romano"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A challenge comes in the shapely form of Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta Jones) who wants to marry (or preferably divorce) her way to riches. With Clooney hired to represent her soon to be ex husband, he inevitably falls for the gold diggers charms.\n\nDirected by the Coen brothers, a directorial team who have helmed oddball comedies such as 'Fargo' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' this is the team's first branch in to a high profile Hollywood film. Clooney, as the sharp suited lawyer, is excellent. Like Cary Grant or David Niven, Clooney is able to mock himself without compensating his screen appeal. Catherine Zeta Jones as the money hungry Marilyn is as sexy as her character demands from the scripted page. However, despite the quick fire dialogue, Intolerable Cruelty is simply not as funny as it thinks, it's cynical message of love and money taking away the romantic push it needs to place it in the league of the Tracy/Hepburn films the movie aspires to. Clooney's character also suffers from an over enthusiastic plot that later drives his character to attempt to commit a crime that totally contradicts the audiences perception of him. A battle of the sexes comedy that has sex appeal but no romance, Intolerable Cruelty is a film that reaches for the golden age of Hollywood but only touches the bronze.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-12-24","keywords":"woman wears eyeglasses,strong female character,lake tahoe,reference to henry viii,deception","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Intolerable Cruelty","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi781320473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000671/","name":"Billy Bob Thornton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0709070/","name":"Robert Ramsey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0832043/","name":"Matthew Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738908/","name":"John Romano"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(DIR: Alexander Payne)\n\nA truly vintage comedy. Paul Giamatti is one of our finest character actors who seems to be neck-and-neck with William H. Macy on cornering the market of portraying losers as a cottage industry and in the latest endeavor of hapless misanthropes he may have found Oscar gold.\n\nGiamatti stars as Miles Raymond, a miserable mope of a man who realizes he is never going to amount to anything especially given the fact that he is his own worst enemy in his highly critical outlook on life particularly on two things he holds dear: his struggling attempts to become a writer of notice and his taste in wine. The latter leads him to a certain road trip to salvation when he embarks upon a few days of r&amp;r away from his stagnant day job as a middle school English teacher with his best friend and former college roomie Jack (Church in easily the career defining role of his life since his hey day on the TV sitcom 'Wings') whose impending nuptials is Miles' wedding gift as the best man. Jack, a long-in-the tooth second-rate soap actor whose 15 minutes are at a close 14:59 is adamant about getting laid for one last time before his commitment to a younger woman who clearly deserves better (and Jack shrewdly knows this).\n\nAs the duo drive through the sun-dappled wine country of Northern California in a road trip not unlike two virginal, horny teens looking to pop their respective cherries, they come across two unlikely conquests. One is the shapely and surprisingly-down-to-earth waitress Maya (Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom) who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie (the sublimely, reassuringly funny Oh, and real  life wife to director Payne) who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack. What unfolds is a sweet yet too-good-to-be true few days of bliss and unbridled emotional rescue for the foursome as they take to one another like ducks to water although Miles' hesitancy is deeply reasoned since he is still licking the open wounds of his two-year old divorce.\n\nPayne, one of my favorite filmmakers, doesn't disappoint as he dollops evenly the tragic-comic proceedings with his frequent long-time collaborator Jim Taylor in adapting an unpublished novel by Rex Pickett that has many layers to it and doesn't betray its four intriguing and ultimately human characters with all their flaws and neuroses on full display. Each actor shines with a few moments of soliloquies and dialogue that ring true that will have you laughing til you cry and vice versa (and that my friend is no easy trick)!\n\nThe four actors give supremely wonderfully acted turns and all are Oscar worthy as well as the screenplay which mixes misery with hope and some truly funny moments including an anger management golf sequence that feels like an outtake from 'Caddyshack' and Giamatti's drunken phone call to his ex is on par with Jon Favreau's car-accident-in-slow-motion answering machine mishap in 'Swingers'  one for the archives. Church makes his borderline jerk a quasi-pathetic lothario who finally sees the forest for the trees in a surprisingly moving moment of realization in a teary confessional; Oh unleashes the old chestnut of a woman's scorn with no-holds-barred and Madsen is a true welcome back from a seemingly endless string of nothing vehicles into this warm and welcome turn as comforting as a blanket on a wintry night in front of a cozy fire.\n\nWhile it is so easy to resort to the wine as metaphor  as the film amply does with smart, sharp and pungent dialogue  the film is a full-bodied, never precocious vintage that needs to be savored in a desirable bouquet of cinematic finesse."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-10-22","keywords":"wine,road trip,vineyard,middle age,wine tasting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sideways","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi864551193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316079/","name":"Paul Giamatti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002006/","name":"Thomas Haden Church"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000515/","name":"Virginia Madsen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088247/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133320/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681914/","name":"Rex Pickett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852591/","name":"Jim Taylor"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Jack, a long-in-the tooth second-rate soap actor whose 15 minutes are at a close 14:59 is adamant about getting laid for one last time before his commitment to a younger woman who clearly deserves better (and Jack shrewdly knows this).\n\nAs the duo drive through the sun-dappled wine country of Northern California in a road trip not unlike two virginal, horny teens looking to pop their respective cherries, they come across two unlikely conquests. One is the shapely and surprisingly-down-to-earth waitress Maya (Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom) who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie (the sublimely, reassuringly funny Oh, and real  life wife to director Payne) who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack. What unfolds is a sweet yet too-good-to-be true few days of bliss and unbridled emotional rescue for the foursome as they take to one another like ducks to water although Miles' hesitancy is deeply reasoned since he is still licking the open wounds of his two-year old divorce.\n\nPayne, one of my favorite filmmakers, doesn't disappoint as he dollops evenly the tragic-comic proceedings with his frequent long-time collaborator Jim Taylor in adapting an unpublished novel by Rex Pickett that has many layers to it and doesn't betray its four intriguing and ultimately human characters with all their flaws and neuroses on full display. Each actor shines with a few moments of soliloquies and dialogue that ring true that will have you laughing til you cry and vice versa (and that my friend is no easy trick)!\n\nThe four actors give supremely wonderfully acted turns and all are Oscar worthy as well as the screenplay which mixes misery with hope and some truly funny moments including an anger management golf sequence that feels like an outtake from 'Caddyshack' and Giamatti's drunken phone call to his ex is on par with Jon Favreau's car-accident-in-slow-motion answering machine mishap in 'Swingers'  one for the archives. Church makes his borderline jerk a quasi-pathetic lothario who finally sees the forest for the trees in a surprisingly moving moment of realization in a teary confessional; Oh unleashes the old chestnut of a woman's scorn with no-holds-barred and Madsen is a true welcome back from a seemingly endless string of nothing vehicles into this warm and welcome turn as comforting as a blanket on a wintry night in front of a cozy fire.\n\nWhile it is so easy to resort to the wine as metaphor  as the film amply does with smart, sharp and pungent dialogue  the film is a full-bodied, never precocious vintage that needs to be savored in a desirable bouquet of cinematic finesse.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-10-22","keywords":"wine,road trip,vineyard,middle age,wine tasting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sideways","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi864551193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316079/","name":"Paul Giamatti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002006/","name":"Thomas Haden Church","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000515/","name":"Virginia Madsen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088247/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133320/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681914/","name":"Rex Pickett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852591/","name":"Jim Taylor"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a shame that it's so mediocre because it could have been something.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4866,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-11-01","keywords":"male frontal nudity,bdsm,dominatrix,death of wife,pulling one's teeth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3920412185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhjOGQ4ZGEtODk5My00ZDJlLWE2N2MtMDY0OTZjMGY2MGY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhjOGQ4ZGEtODk5My00ZDJlLWE2N2MtMDY0OTZjMGY2MGY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032916/","name":"Pekka Strang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312062/","name":"Ester Geislerová","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10638857/","name":"Ellen Karppo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1672969/","name":"J.-P.

Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"}],"duration":"PT2H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm sure there are many more like this one that would be great for film as an avenue for people to learn about.\n\n SYNOPSIS: During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a "hero" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.\n\nDIRECTION: Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.\n\nWRITING: The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).\n\nACTING: The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is "of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film? I mean Sam Rockwell was great in this film too, but he's another one of those "yea, but he's too good to nominate. Wouldn't be fare." Paul Walter Hauser shows so much emotion and is SO good at being a man who is holding in his anger, because he respects law enforcement too much. Then in the scenes where he breaks are just tremendous. I will be sorely disappointed if he is not nominated this year.\n\nCONCLUSION: Richard Jewell is a great story about one of American's greatest heroes who probably didn't get enough praise for the job that he did. The story itself and Paul Walter Hauser was enough for me to really enjoy this film, unfortunately there were some flaws with the story with some of the characters and some of the writing. In the end, I would definitely recommend this film for anyone to watch. Richard Jewell is the nicest man I have never met and this is just another story to show that doesn't matter how kind and genuine you are, you'll always have someone try to tear you down.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm sure there are many more like this one that would be great for film as an avenue for people to learn about.\n\n SYNOPSIS: During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a "hero" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.\n\nDIRECTION: Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.\n\nWRITING: The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).\n\nACTING: The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is "of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film?

It's the exact opposite counterpoint and it shows the price of the Mexicans have to pay for their desire to emmigrate to America for a better life.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-27","keywords":"mother,mother searches for missing son,u.s. mexico border,mexico,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466403609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDNiMTE1YzMtNGEyMy00NjhiLWE4YmUtYzcxYWY5NThhMTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDNiMTE1YzMtNGEyMy00NjhiLWE4YmUtYzcxYWY5NThhMTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2543344/","name":"Mercedes Hernández","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6468037/","name":"David Illescas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11190555/","name":"Juan Jesús Varela"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3635576/","name":"Fernanda Valadez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0344964/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0629542/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564009/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2156418/","name":"Astrid Rondero","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3635576/","name":"Fernanda Valadez"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They are not.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1772271/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"brando647"},"dateCreated":"2013-08-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"A Few Fun Moments but It Tries Too Hard","reviewBody":"Every so often, you'll find a fun little independent comedy that comes along and blows every mainstream, nation-wide release out of the water for that year. FRANKIE GO BOOM is not one of these movies. It is a comedy and it does have a little bit of fun to it, but for the most part the movie is one of those middle of the road mediocre comedies that will easily find itself forgotten before it's ever really noticed. This is what makes FRANKIE GO BOOM so disappointing: it's not good and it's not bad enough to be fun. Watching this movie, I cracked a few smiles and might have even chuckled a few times but, when I try to remember any particular standout moment from the movie, I only come up with the nightmarish image of Ron Perlman's butt. This is not the response a good comedy wants from its audience. For those unaware, FRANKIE GO BOOM is about a writer (the titular Frankie, played by Charlie Hunnam) and his ex-drug addict, aspiring filmmaker brother Bruce (Chris O'Dowd). Frankie is called home from his isolated trailer in the middle of Death Valley, where he lives after having been humiliated at his own wedding by his brother. Bruce has spent his entire life tormenting his brother on film, and Frankie is horrified to discover that his brother hasn't given up his film obsession. He almost believes that Bruce might've changed his ways but a chance meeting with a beautiful woman (Lizzy Caplan) and a night of problematic loving leads to the realization that Bruce might've caught the entire embarrassing event on tape. And soon that tape makes its to the Internet and the hands of Bruce's unstable fellow recovering addict (Chris Noth) who happens to be that woman's father. Prepare for a forgettable adventure as Frankie and Bruce try to stop that tape from ruining Frankie's budding relationship or, you know, getting them killed at the hands of a violent psychopath.\n\nI needed a second viewing to determine that this movie wasn't just offensively boring. There are a few funny moments here. I don't remember exactly where they were though. The movie is filled with things that expected to be funny, just because. You might need an example to understand what I'm talking about: Jack, Bruce's addict/actor friend, owns a pet pig. Pigs are funny, yes? Not enough? All right, the pig is launched into a pool and proceeds to throw up on Frankie before his date with Lassie (Lizzy Caplan's character, not the collie). There's no real joke. Just a pig nearly drowning and then puking on Frankie. I get the same vibe from Ron Perlman's character, a post-op transgender ex-convict named Phyllis. We're supposed to laugh because it's Rob Perlman, an admittedly rough-looking dude, in drag. Very bad drag. Phyllis goes on to chat about his/her former genitals kept in a jar and becoming very upset when Frankie doesn't want to see them. This is the whole joke: a particularly unattractive transgender person pushing an uncomfortable man into seeing his pickled junk. There are a lot of little moments like this in the movie, and it doesn't make for a real laugh-out-loud sort of comedy.\n\nIt's a shame this movie is so tame because the ingredients are all there for a real fun time. Chris O'Dowd is great. I've been catch more and more of his work since first seeing him as the love interest in BRIDESMAIDS (for the record, the BBC's "The IT Crowd" is great). The problem with his character Bruce is that he's, you know, a sociopath. You almost become as frustrated watching him as Frankie does dealing with him. I find it hard to believe that Bruce doesn't understand the problem with what he does. He becomes a caricature. So does Frankie. Frankie (Hunnam) is pretty one-dimensional. He's just the 'frustrated sibling'  grumbling, sighing, and throwing his hands into the air in exasperation. He doesn't bring anything interesting to the character, though I imagine that's more the writer/director Jordan Roberts' fault. There is no depth to the characters and the movie plods along from gag to gag while eliciting no more than a few chuckles. FRANKIE GOES BOOM wants to be a comedy in the vein of HAROLD &amp; KUMAR but it doesn't come close. The one element of the film that goes so far as to aggravate me is the nonsensical resolution. We spend the entire movie with these two clowns as they chase down anyone that might be able to help them take the movie off-line and prevent Jack from seeing it, and the ending we're given makes no sense whatsoever. I can tell Roberts must have had some problems coming up with a good ending for his movie, so he had a few drinks to help him finish it and just shot whatever ramblings he woke up to in the morning.\n\nFRANKIE GO BOOM is a movie that has come and gone before most people probably had a chance to realize it existed. There is a lot of potential here and it sucks to see it go nowhere, especially when there are some talent people in the cast. Frankie doesn't go boom because FRANKIE is, well, a dud.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-10","keywords":"jock strap,male objectification,bare chested male,masturbation reference,name in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3001918745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MDI1Njg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3MDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MDI1Njg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3MDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Frank Bartlett has been tortured, embarrassed, and humiliated by his brother Bruce -- usually on film -- his entire life.

FRANKIE GO BOOM is not one of these movies. It is a comedy and it does have a little bit of fun to it, but for the most part the movie is one of those middle of the road mediocre comedies that will easily find itself forgotten before it's ever really noticed. This is what makes FRANKIE GO BOOM so disappointing: it's not good and it's not bad enough to be fun. Watching this movie, I cracked a few smiles and might have even chuckled a few times but, when I try to remember any particular standout moment from the movie, I only come up with the nightmarish image of Ron Perlman's butt. This is not the response a good comedy wants from its audience. For those unaware, FRANKIE GO BOOM is about a writer (the titular Frankie, played by Charlie Hunnam) and his ex-drug addict, aspiring filmmaker brother Bruce (Chris O'Dowd). Frankie is called home from his isolated trailer in the middle of Death Valley, where he lives after having been humiliated at his own wedding by his brother. Bruce has spent his entire life tormenting his brother on film, and Frankie is horrified to discover that his brother hasn't given up his film obsession. He almost believes that Bruce might've changed his ways but a chance meeting with a beautiful woman (Lizzy Caplan) and a night of problematic loving leads to the realization that Bruce might've caught the entire embarrassing event on tape. And soon that tape makes its to the Internet and the hands of Bruce's unstable fellow recovering addict (Chris Noth) who happens to be that woman's father. Prepare for a forgettable adventure as Frankie and Bruce try to stop that tape from ruining Frankie's budding relationship or, you know, getting them killed at the hands of a violent psychopath.\n\nI needed a second viewing to determine that this movie wasn't just offensively boring. There are a few funny moments here. I don't remember exactly where they were though. The movie is filled with things that expected to be funny, just because. You might need an example to understand what I'm talking about: Jack, Bruce's addict/actor friend, owns a pet pig. Pigs are funny, yes? Not enough? All right, the pig is launched into a pool and proceeds to throw up on Frankie before his date with Lassie (Lizzy Caplan's character, not the collie). There's no real joke. Just a pig nearly drowning and then puking on Frankie. I get the same vibe from Ron Perlman's character, a post-op transgender ex-convict named Phyllis. We're supposed to laugh because it's Rob Perlman, an admittedly rough-looking dude, in drag. Very bad drag. Phyllis goes on to chat about his/her former genitals kept in a jar and becoming very upset when Frankie doesn't want to see them. This is the whole joke: a particularly unattractive transgender person pushing an uncomfortable man into seeing his pickled junk. There are a lot of little moments like this in the movie, and it doesn't make for a real laugh-out-loud sort of comedy.\n\nIt's a shame this movie is so tame because the ingredients are all there for a real fun time. Chris O'Dowd is great. I've been catch more and more of his work since first seeing him as the love interest in BRIDESMAIDS (for the record, the BBC's "The IT Crowd" is great). The problem with his character Bruce is that he's, you know, a sociopath. You almost become as frustrated watching him as Frankie does dealing with him. I find it hard to believe that Bruce doesn't understand the problem with what he does. He becomes a caricature. So does Frankie. Frankie (Hunnam) is pretty one-dimensional. He's just the 'frustrated sibling'  grumbling, sighing, and throwing his hands into the air in exasperation. He doesn't bring anything interesting to the character, though I imagine that's more the writer/director Jordan Roberts' fault. There is no depth to the characters and the movie plods along from gag to gag while eliciting no more than a few chuckles. FRANKIE GOES BOOM wants to be a comedy in the vein of HAROLD &amp; KUMAR but it doesn't come close. The one element of the film that goes so far as to aggravate me is the nonsensical resolution. We spend the entire movie with these two clowns as they chase down anyone that might be able to help them take the movie off-line and prevent Jack from seeing it, and the ending we're given makes no sense whatsoever. I can tell Roberts must have had some problems coming up with a good ending for his movie, so he had a few drinks to help him finish it and just shot whatever ramblings he woke up to in the morning.\n\nFRANKIE GO BOOM is a movie that has come and gone before most people probably had a chance to realize it existed. There is a lot of potential here and it sucks to see it go nowhere, especially when there are some talent people in the cast. Frankie doesn't go boom because FRANKIE is, well, a dud.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-10","keywords":"jock strap,male objectification,bare chested male,masturbation reference,name in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3001918745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MDI1Njg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3MDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MDI1Njg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3MDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Frank Bartlett has been tortured, embarrassed, and humiliated by his brother Bruce -- usually on film -- his entire life.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2080374/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"AlsExGal","dateCreated":"2017-07-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"an abstract portrait of the man..","reviewBody":"... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.\n\nFor example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Seldom have I seen such a fun programme. Yes, fun. This was funny, sexy, violent, bonkers and emotionally truthful in a way that other series fail to achieve.\n\nTo think that this was aiming for any kind of historical accuracy is mad. It was made as an entertainment riffing on possible historical events. The use of modern language, initially jarring, ends up working to its advantage. There's no more reason to dislike modern usage than there is to dislike cod medieval or cod turn of the millennia language. Any language choice is going to be inauthentic so you might as well go for modern vernacular which has the side effect of milking the dialogue for humour. Using Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man for the theme tune is as inspired as using Nick Cave for the theme tune of Peaky Blinders. \n\nYou might also like to note the satirical reference to other well-known franchises and the use of Shakespearian minor characters. The two centurions sampling the "stash" of the witch doctor was comedy gold.\n\nYes, how we all hunger for the certainty of the old days when you knew where you were.

The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's "Psycho" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":910168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's "Psycho" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":910168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds.

Before even filming we knew Guy Ritchie was obviously the wrong choice to direct the film. His style doesn't quite lend itself to this type of film. Miscast Mena Massoud didn't bring any real character to the role of Aladdin he was simply okay/ functional. Will Smith is as usual charismatic and had difficult shoes to fill after Robin Williams' take on the genie but he was seriously let down by the VFX in blue genie mode and a weak script. Another miscast Naomi Scott gave a good performance but I always felt i was looking at Indian and not Middle Eastern. In fact the film IS very bollywood with the Jasmin, Aladdin dance off Indian Style (and to Indian music) then Russian dancing(?) plus other times an Indian soundtrack. And i'm not even going to talk about that sorry excuse for a villain. No, no i am not. For a Disney movie set in large Kingdom it sure does feel quite quite small. It looked cheap too. Weird. Ultimately a dreadfully executed cash grab of a movie that no one asked for. Thanks D.

Will Smith is as usual charismatic and had difficult shoes to fill after Robin Williams' take on the genie but he was seriously let down by the VFX in blue genie mode and a weak script. Another miscast Naomi Scott gave a good performance but I always felt i was looking at Indian and not Middle Eastern. In fact the film IS very bollywood with the Jasmin, Aladdin dance off Indian Style (and to Indian music) then Russian dancing(?) plus other times an Indian soundtrack. And i'm not even going to talk about that sorry excuse for a villain. No, no i am not. For a Disney movie set in large Kingdom it sure does feel quite quite small. It looked cheap too. Weird. Ultimately a dreadfully executed cash grab of a movie that no one asked for. Thanks D. Thankfully this is exactly what i expected having seen the trailers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247604,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-05-22","keywords":"hero,monkey,genie character,tiger,parrot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Aladdin","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3875453977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4565815/","name":"Mena Massoud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4305463/","name":"Naomi Scott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226345/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0699871/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible.

But most of the material was stuff taken from the original only tweaked, and I hate to say it but I was actually bored for a good part of the movie. Some of the jokes/scenes dragged to long, to the point where I didn't find them funny anymore. There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous/original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. Some of the scenes were more outrageous in the sense that there was some full frontal nudity, but I'm not someone who finds that super entertaining. Overall it felt to me like a re-hash of stuff that had already been done with some naked people thrown in, and it just wasn't enjoyable like the first movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":480421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-05-26","keywords":"wedding,strip club,pubic hair,hangover,bachelor party","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Hangover: Part II - Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2196348185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug travel to Bangkok for Stu's wedding.

But most of the material was stuff taken from the original only tweaked, and I hate to say it but I was actually bored for a good part of the movie. Some of the jokes/scenes dragged to long, to the point where I didn't find them funny anymore. There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous/original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. Some of the scenes were more outrageous in the sense that there was some full frontal nudity, but I'm not someone who finds that super entertaining. Overall it felt to me like a re-hash of stuff that had already been done with some naked people thrown in, and it just wasn't enjoyable like the first movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":480421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-05-26","keywords":"wedding,strip club,pubic hair,hangover,bachelor party","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Hangover: Part II - Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2196348185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug travel to Bangkok for Stu's wedding.

The film was foot-tapping fun and the dark turn it took in the third act, while unexpected, made it edgy and different for me. When a sequel was announced, I thought it seemed unnecessary. How far can you really stretch the premise of penguins who can dance and sing? Apparently, not that far. After viewing the sequel, it very much does seem unnecessary and wholly forgettable within ten minutes after you walk out of the theater, which is disappointing to say the least. Other than this, the main problem with HAPPY FEET 2 is that there aren't that many good musical numbers as compared to the first one. Most of them are pretty mediocre. However, there are probably around three that range from good to great, one of which uses the song "Under Pressure," which is easily the best number in the entire film.\n\nAnother problem I had was the dark tone of the film. It's a bit TOO dark, if you ask me. You see the younger penguin characters constantly be put in danger which made the film very uncomfortable to watch, and what these characters go through in the film would probably traumatize them for life. The film also suffers from messy storytelling. For example, the subplot with the shrimp characters (voiced by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt) seems to come from nowhere and is out of place from the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that the characters are so damn annoying. As for the 3D, it's put to good use in some places but, overall, it's really unnecessary. The one good thing I can say about the film is the look of it, which is very beautiful. I also liked Pink a lot, who gives a boost for all the musical numbers she sings in, along with Robin Williams, who has a few great jokes up his sleeves.\n\nOverall, HAPPY FEET 2 is a disappointment considering that I am a fan of the first film. Director George Miller doesn't seem to have his heart in the right place for this sequel compared to the first film. However, the film is slightly better then CARS 2 if that says anything.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43502,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-11-30","keywords":"anthropomorphic penguin,seal the animal,movie flop,3 dimensional,computer animation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2726469145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTEwOTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTEwOTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Mumble, the Master of Tap, has a problem: his son, Erik, is choreo-phobic.

The film also suffers from messy storytelling. For example, the subplot with the shrimp characters (voiced by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt) seems to come from nowhere and is out of place from the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that the characters are so damn annoying. As for the 3D, it's put to good use in some places but, overall, it's really unnecessary. The one good thing I can say about the film is the look of it, which is very beautiful. I also liked Pink a lot, who gives a boost for all the musical numbers she sings in, along with Robin Williams, who has a few great jokes up his sleeves.\n\nOverall, HAPPY FEET 2 is a disappointment considering that I am a fan of the first film. Director George Miller doesn't seem to have his heart in the right place for this sequel compared to the first film. However, the film is slightly better then CARS 2 if that says anything.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43502,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-11-30","keywords":"anthropomorphic penguin,seal the animal,movie flop,3 dimensional,computer animation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2726469145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTEwOTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTEwOTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Mumble, the Master of Tap, has a problem: his son, Erik, is choreo-phobic.

I love the deadpan delivery of funny lines: "I just bit into a pepper," a man says, when caught tearing up. I love the payoff when scams reach their climax.\n\nBut I wanted this movie to thrill me as the previous "Ocean" movies have, and, while it was a slick good time, it wasn't memorable.\n\nThere is less character development here than in previous movies. Ocean is not pursuing Tess. Linus has pretty much proved himself.\n\nThere wasn't the spectacular stunts as performed by Shaobo Qin in "Ocean's 11" or Vincent Cassel in "Ocean's 12." "Ocean's 13" doesn't fully exploit Las Vegas -- we've seen this movie's Las Vegas before.\n\nAl Pacino is kind of blah as the villain. I wasn't afraid of him; I just kept wondering why he had orange hair. Andy Garcia is more juicy in a smaller, ambivalent role.\n\nThe movie resuscitates the film career of Ellen Barkin. She looks spectacular: flat stomach, legs to die for, magnificent cleavage. And then what do they do? Humiliate her and make a bitter comment about how she is a woman "of a certain age." "Oceans 13" would have been a better movie if it had made better use of this hot actress. A sex scene between her and the ever cool Matt Damon would have perked the movie up.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"revenge,casino,heist,comeuppance,hubris","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Thirteen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1654522137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002718/","name":"Brian Koppelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505522/","name":"David Levien"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I love the deadpan delivery of funny lines: "I just bit into a pepper," a man says, when caught tearing up. I love the payoff when scams reach their climax.\n\nBut I wanted this movie to thrill me as the previous "Ocean" movies have, and, while it was a slick good time, it wasn't memorable.\n\nThere is less character development here than in previous movies. Ocean is not pursuing Tess. Linus has pretty much proved himself.\n\nThere wasn't the spectacular stunts as performed by Shaobo Qin in "Ocean's 11" or Vincent Cassel in "Ocean's 12." "Ocean's 13" doesn't fully exploit Las Vegas -- we've seen this movie's Las Vegas before.\n\nAl Pacino is kind of blah as the villain. I wasn't afraid of him; I just kept wondering why he had orange hair. Andy Garcia is more juicy in a smaller, ambivalent role.\n\nThe movie resuscitates the film career of Ellen Barkin. She looks spectacular: flat stomach, legs to die for, magnificent cleavage. And then what do they do? Humiliate her and make a bitter comment about how she is a woman "of a certain age." "Oceans 13" would have been a better movie if it had made better use of this hot actress. A sex scene between her and the ever cool Matt Damon would have perked the movie up.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"revenge,casino,heist,comeuppance,hubris","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Thirteen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1654522137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002718/","name":"Brian Koppelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505522/","name":"David Levien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple "yeah, right" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.\n\nThe film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: "Unstoppable" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's "Runaway Train," it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.\n\nGRADE: B","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-11-10","keywords":"train,runaway train,train engineer,freight train,train movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unstoppable: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3068790297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276484/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple "yeah, right" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.\n\nThe film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: "Unstoppable" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's "Runaway Train," it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.\n\nGRADE: B","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-11-10","keywords":"train,runaway train,train engineer,freight train,train movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unstoppable: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3068790297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276484/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Still a fun movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100461,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.\n\nIt's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.\n\nThe ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.\n\nUltimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically. In particular, Armitage's Thorin is different and darker, yet changes a great deal throughout the film - all in all, a fantastic performance. There's plenty of typical Jackson humour, some brilliant cameos and some great nods to the Lord of the Rings films and some elements of the film's production, which die-hard fans will no doubt pick up on with a smile. It's also important to realise that, whilst it's easy to criticise the long battle sequences, they are entertaining, and keep the pace of the film up throughout.\n\nSo, whilst it is easy to concentrate on the negatives and, in particular, the lack of a Grey Havens-esque adieu to Middle Earth, The Battle of Five Armies is still a great film and a fitting end to what has been a true achievement: a series of beautiful film adaptations that many will be sad to see end.\n\n\n* Ed\n","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":497786,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2014-12-12","keywords":"middle earth,army,epic,hobbit,epic battle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1092005657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bilbo and Company are forced to be embraced in a war against an armed flock of combatants and the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0035514/","name":"Richard Armitage"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909638/","name":"Fran Walsh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101991/","name":"Philippa Boyens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Seldom have I seen such a fun programme. Yes, fun. This was funny, sexy, violent, bonkers and emotionally truthful in a way that other series fail to achieve.\n\nTo think that this was aiming for any kind of historical accuracy is mad. It was made as an entertainment riffing on possible historical events. The use of modern language, initially jarring, ends up working to its advantage. There's no more reason to dislike modern usage than there is to dislike cod medieval or cod turn of the millennia language. Any language choice is going to be inauthentic so you might as well go for modern vernacular which has the side effect of milking the dialogue for humour. Using Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man for the theme tune is as inspired as using Nick Cave for the theme tune of Peaky Blinders. \n\nYou might also like to note the satirical reference to other well-known franchises and the use of Shakespearian minor characters. The two centurions sampling the "stash" of the witch doctor was comedy gold.\n\nYes, how we all hunger for the certainty of the old days when you knew where you were. When Loved It or Hated It reviews could be searched on and all TV programmes followed the same rules and were as bland as each other.

One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.\n\nIt's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.\n\nThe ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.\n\nUltimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically. In particular, Armitage's Thorin is different and darker, yet changes a great deal throughout the film - all in all, a fantastic performance. There's plenty of typical Jackson humour, some brilliant cameos and some great nods to the Lord of the Rings films and some elements of the film's production, which die-hard fans will no doubt pick up on with a smile. It's also important to realise that, whilst it's easy to criticise the long battle sequences, they are entertaining, and keep the pace of the film up throughout.\n\nSo, whilst it is easy to concentrate on the negatives and, in particular, the lack of a Grey Havens-esque adieu to Middle Earth, The Battle of Five Armies is still a great film and a fitting end to what has been a true achievement: a series of beautiful film adaptations that many will be sad to see end.\n\n\n* Ed\n","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":497786,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2014-12-12","keywords":"middle earth,army,epic,hobbit,epic battle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1092005657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bilbo and Company are forced to be embraced in a war against an armed flock of combatants and the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0035514/","name":"Richard Armitage"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909638/","name":"Fran Walsh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101991/","name":"Philippa Boyens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.\n\nIt's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.\n\nThe ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.\n\nUltimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically. In particular, Armitage's Thorin is different and darker, yet changes a great deal throughout the film - all in all, a fantastic performance. There's plenty of typical Jackson humour, some brilliant cameos and some great nods to the Lord of the Rings films and some elements of the film's production, which die-hard fans will no doubt pick up on with a smile. It's also important to realise that, whilst it's easy to criticise the long battle sequences, they are entertaining, and keep the pace of the film up throughout.\n\nSo, whilst it is easy to concentrate on the negatives and, in particular, the lack of a Grey Havens-esque adieu to Middle Earth, The Battle of Five Armies is still a great film and a fitting end to what has been a true achievement: a series of beautiful film adaptations that many will be sad to see end.\n\n\n* Ed\n","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":497786,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2014-12-12","keywords":"middle earth,army,epic,hobbit,epic battle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1092005657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bilbo and Company are forced to be embraced in a war against an armed flock of combatants and the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0035514/","name":"Richard Armitage"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909638/","name":"Fran Walsh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101991/","name":"Philippa Boyens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story. I for the most part was disappointed, it could have been so much better, all the had to do was pay attention to the source material, and not just scan over it. Also the re-writing of many of the characters is inconceivable to me, no idea why they would do it. \n\nMeh... I didn't like it very much.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-20","keywords":"dystopia,book burning,flamethrower,emoji,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young girl...and begins to rebel against society."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story. I for the most part was disappointed, it could have been so much better, all the had to do was pay attention to the source material, and not just scan over it. Also the re-writing of many of the characters is inconceivable to me, no idea why they would do it. \n\nMeh... I didn't like it very much.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-20","keywords":"dystopia,book burning,flamethrower,emoji,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young girl...and begins to rebel against society.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful.

The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box. I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast is still good in their roles. Derek and Hansel are still the same characters and they play them with enthusiasm and Mugatu is well, OK. Sadly, everything else is pretty much garbage. The humor did not work at all and I just wanted it to be over. After 5 minutes of the movie I was just exhausted. This is a clear example that bigger does not mean better. I am a fan of the original Zoolander and one of the things I liked about that film is that it was just a small comedy with a relatively small budget and it evolved as a cult film. Zoolander 2 tries to be bigger than the first one and it just doesn't work. The first was pretty much about Mugatu trying to hypnotize a male model to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. That was the plot. Stupid? Definitely, but it worked in its own right. This one's about Derek trying to locate his son, while male models are being assassinated, which actually did not pay off at all in the end. \n\nThe movie is filled with unnecessary cameos and there can be too much of a good thing. It happened last year with the Entourage movie and now with this. Like I said, everything is bigger, the scope and even the effects, but what Stiller and his production crew don't get is that what made the original Zoolander so funny and good was that it seemed like they were taking a chance. It was kind of cheap and small but it worked.\n\nThe film doesn't work at all but I'll say this: At least it didn't feel cynical. To me it seemed like they were actually trying to make a good film and a funny one but it just did not work. The humor is mostly like people getting hit in the face and stuff like that. The movie also tries way too hard to recall on things from the original that were funny. As a fan of the original and as a moviegoer in general, I would not recommend Zoolander 2. I laughed 5 times in the whole movie. I counted them. And as a comedy that's the main problem with the movie: It was not funny.\n\n1.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67429,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-02-24","keywords":"absurdism,overweight child,model,modeling,fashion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1139323417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDU2MTkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyMTgzNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDU2MTkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyMTgzNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Derek and Hansel team up with an Interpol agent to find out who is behind the deaths of the world's biggest pop stars."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094563/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039303/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857620/","name":"Justin Theroux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831557/","name":"Nicholas Stoller"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I am a devout fan of Austin Powers, Wayne's World (where's #3 in the series???), and, actually, yes, I did enjoy Cat in the Hat, although it was not a piece of art. And I understand if fans of Mike Myers will still go to see this film. I did after all, even after reading the terrible reviews. Sadly, this time, the critics were correct. Mike knows better. The director should've known better. Mike Myers's return to live action comedy is more than disappointing. Even the character, Your Holiness the Guru Pitka, was unlikeable (which is a first for a Mike Myers character). He was so full of himself, so damn selfish, no one cared if he succeeded. His giggle-fits were too common to spark a slight giggle from the audience. And although the women in the film were pure eye-candy (Jessica Alba, Meagan Good, even Mariska Hargitay and Jessica Simpson made cameos), they became little more than that with such a flat script. Sorry Mike. Maybe next time. A fourth Austin Powers would be quite a way to get back in the game with your biggest fans:)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51916,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance","Sport"],"datePublished":"2008-10-29","keywords":"fake flatulence,male flatulence,breaking wind,female flatulence,belching","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Love Guru","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2528248089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMTc1ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMTc1ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Love Guru Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004695/","name":"Jessica Alba"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0539082/","name":"Romany Malco"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0773605/","name":"Marco Schnabel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245613/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255996/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330704/","name":"Graham Gordy"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But I do know what I was feeling after the credits started rolling. Disappointment. And don't get me wrong. I am a huge Mike Myers fan. I am a devout fan of Austin Powers, Wayne's World (where's #3 in the series???), and, actually, yes, I did enjoy Cat in the Hat, although it was not a piece of art. And I understand if fans of Mike Myers will still go to see this film. I did after all, even after reading the terrible reviews. Sadly, this time, the critics were correct. Mike knows better. The director should've known better. Mike Myers's return to live action comedy is more than disappointing. Even the character, Your Holiness the Guru Pitka, was unlikeable (which is a first for a Mike Myers character). He was so full of himself, so damn selfish, no one cared if he succeeded. His giggle-fits were too common to spark a slight giggle from the audience. And although the women in the film were pure eye-candy (Jessica Alba, Meagan Good, even Mariska Hargitay and Jessica Simpson made cameos), they became little more than that with such a flat script. Sorry Mike. Maybe next time. A fourth Austin Powers would be quite a way to get back in the game with your biggest fans:)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51916,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance","Sport"],"datePublished":"2008-10-29","keywords":"fake flatulence,male flatulence,breaking wind,female flatulence,belching","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Love Guru","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2528248089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMTc1ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMTc1ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Love Guru Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004695/","name":"Jessica Alba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0539082/","name":"Romany Malco"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0773605/","name":"Marco Schnabel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245613/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255996/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330704/","name":"Graham Gordy"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was a cartoonish film trilogy in the 1990s. Recently, Michael Bay produced a franchise-reboot as a live action-computer-generated motion capture film. I did not particularly like this very dark 2014 film, rating it only a 5/10.

The arch-villain had inter- galactically nefarious plans as he conspired with mad scientist Dr. Baxter Stockman to bring into Earth an evil Dimension X being called Krang and his Technodrome in his wild dream of world domination. \n\nThe way the turtles looked in this new film was way better executed. In the first one, they all looked too big, ugly and unwieldy. Their appearance now is more accessible, more in tune with their personalities. Even if the storyline will have their team tested, this was a truly excellent ensemble work among the four actors behind them, imbuing each one with individual charm. They are: Pete Ploszek (as conflicted leader Leonardo), Alan Ritchson (as muscle- bound rebel Raphael), Jeremy Howard (as brainy scientist Donatello) and Noel Fisher (as childlike spirit Michelangelo). \n\nAlso similarly excellent were the CG artwork, performance and the on screen chemistry between the two comical evil side characters, warthog Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and the rhino Rocksteady (Stephen Farrelly). They definitely stole their scenes from right under the main bad guy Shredder (Brian Tee), who felt rather lackluster among the other colorful characters of the film. The pinkish brain-like maniacal alien super-villain Krang was portrayed with gruesome glee by Brad Garrett.\n\nThe unconvincing and hammy acting of Megan Fox (as April) and Will Arnett (as Vern) were fortunately buoyed up the excellence of the CGI and story around them. Tyler Perry was an over-the-top nerd as Dr. Stockman, uncomfortably funny. Veteran acting nominee Laura Linney was uncharacteristically stiff as police chief Rebecca Vincent. The best live performer of the film was TV's "Arrow" Stephen Amell as Casey Jones. His graceful physicality (with a hockey stick and skates) and smart-alecky sense of humor made him stand out. \n\nThe look of this new film is so much better than the first one, literally "out of the shadows" where the first one wallowed. There were brighter colors, a lighter mood, a more fun throwback general feel about it. The previous one was too dark and intense, and took itself too seriously, to its own detriment. With this one, we had our beloved Turtles back to the unpretentious way we knew them in our youth. Serious critics may be hard on this one, but I really enjoyed 112 minutes with it, right up to the classic TV cartoon theme song over the closing credits.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2016-06-29","keywords":"sequel,turtle,based on cartoon,rat,brother brother relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2458694681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they return to save the city from a dangerous threat."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1083271/","name":"Megan Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1347153/","name":"Tyler Perry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1757777/","name":"Dave Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0032227/","name":"Josh Appelbaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625858/","name":"André Nemec"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481990/","name":"Peter Laird"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Her love interest, whose name I haven't bothered to look up, was adept at playing a character who is creating those situations for Anne. Really, the only reason I continued with the movie was because I was trying to figure out what was going on with him. it created some curiosity, although, at too slow a pace for me.\n\nIt will appeal more those who are intrigued by a mystery (and not a very complicated one), and a reassuring sense of comfort. The major flaws with this movie are first, its pace. If you have a short attention span and need any serious suspense, this is likely to bore you. Secondly, it borrows from another film pretty heavily, making it unoriginal.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36081,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Mystery","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-09-26","keywords":"airplane crash,survivor,explosion,afterlife,doctor patient relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Passengers: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3525836825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Passengers, directed by Rodrigo GarcÃ­a.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001556/","name":"David Morse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006554/","name":"Rodrigo García"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142446/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123049/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159892/","name":"Ronnie Christensen"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast is still good in their roles. Derek and Hansel are still the same characters and they play them with enthusiasm and Mugatu is well, OK. Sadly, everything else is pretty much garbage. The humor did not work at all and I just wanted it to be over. After 5 minutes of the movie I was just exhausted. This is a clear example that bigger does not mean better. I am a fan of the original Zoolander and one of the things I liked about that film is that it was just a small comedy with a relatively small budget and it evolved as a cult film. Zoolander 2 tries to be bigger than the first one and it just doesn't work. The first was pretty much about Mugatu trying to hypnotize a male model to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. That was the plot. Stupid? Definitely, but it worked in its own right. This one's about Derek trying to locate his son, while male models are being assassinated, which actually did not pay off at all in the end. \n\nThe movie is filled with unnecessary cameos and there can be too much of a good thing. It happened last year with the Entourage movie and now with this. Like I said, everything is bigger, the scope and even the effects, but what Stiller and his production crew don't get is that what made the original Zoolander so funny and good was that it seemed like they were taking a chance. It was kind of cheap and small but it worked.\n\nThe film doesn't work at all but I'll say this: At least it didn't feel cynical. To me it seemed like they were actually trying to make a good film and a funny one but it just did not work. The humor is mostly like people getting hit in the face and stuff like that. The movie also tries way too hard to recall on things from the original that were funny. As a fan of the original and as a moviegoer in general, I would not recommend Zoolander 2. I laughed 5 times in the whole movie. I counted them.

It is not trying to be clever. It is simply out and out slap stick routine stretched out through decently scripted film.\n\nThis films simple premise is to make you laugh. It certainly made me laugh. The over the top jokes, scenarios and pain really brought this to life as a silly belly laughfest.\n\nNice light hearted comedy offering a laugh to all ages. I think a no brainer comedy is a good thing to lift spirits and raise a smile.\n\nI cant imagine anyone not finding this film funny in one way or another. If you like the comedy style of Jim Carey and movement of Lee Evans or Rowan Atkinson then I recommend you give this a go.\n\nEnjoy","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39005,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1996-02-02","keywords":"clumsiness,embarrassment,political campaign,politics,crooked politician","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3586310425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","description":"A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000394/","name":"Chris Farley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005450/","name":"David Spade","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001513/","name":"Tim Matheson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790715/","name":"Penelope Spheeris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's all based on fact (from Jon Ronson's book) but the concept is so silly that director Grant Heslov and George Clooney (both worked on "Good Night, and Good Luck) really can't help but make fun of it, and there are some good laughs here. Just no real story.\n\nEwan McGregor plays journalist Bob Wilton, a jilted husband who goes to war to forget his backstabbing wife only to end up wiling away in Kuwait. One night he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a familiar name to him from a previous interview he did years before about psychic-spies. Lyn was the best in what was called the "New Earth Army", started by Vietnam-Vet Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) in the 80's to create soldiers with super-powers who could prevent conflict. The Army was later dismantled and used for evil purposes by the movie's antagonist Hooper (Kevin Spacey) but Lyn tells Bob he's been re-activated, and has a secret mission to do in Iraq. Bob, thinking Lyn crazy but interesting at the same time, decides to team up with him and go where the action is. Along the way, Lyn tells him stories of others dubbed, "Jedi Warriors." \n\nMost of the movie is flashbacks, beginning with Iraq War 2003 and chronicling all the way back to the beginning of New Age warfare. There are weird and crazy laughs to be had like Lyn's initiation, where Django urges him he will never be a soldier unless he can free the dance. The lines are good too. "We tried invisibility but then worked it down to just not being seen", Lyn tells Bob upon their first meeting. Clooney is perfectly eccentric as a guy who lives by the mindfulness-over-warfare principal and McGregor is a whiny, but solid straight-man. Bridges is also terrific as this free-spirited hippie. Only the laughs and flashbacks (which feel like a series of sketches) aren't enough to distract from the fact that "Goats" really has no compelling narrative. The forward-moving story in Iraq 2003 has very little momentum. Spacey appears later on again as the villain but the conflict is weak and the movie has more than over-stayed its welcome.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"2009-11-06","keywords":"satire,army training,iraq war,secret military operation,goat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Paranormal Activity -- "Paranormal Goats" TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi309003545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzI0OTM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgwMDg5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzI0OTM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgwMDg5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A TV trailer for the movie Paranormal Activity."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104115/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0184096/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740160/","name":"Jon Ronson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Is this film in the same league as those films of yester-year? Not by a long shot. While the premise has a great deal of promise behind it, by the end this is a huge disappointment, a film that sacrifices disturbing realism for over-the-top theatrics by the climax, which is a real shame.\n\nTheatrics is appropriate, as in the end this turns out to be adapted from a stage play, as evinced by the single-room setting. The first half is quirky and unusual, as we watch the film wondering how it's going to turn out. It flirts with a lot of themes and genres, without ever being easily pigeon-holed into a single one. Is it a psychological study of madness? Is it a creature feature horror flick? Is it a study of domestic violence, a romance, a two-hander character piece? It's all of those, but by the end the intense script falls apart and ends up tackling over-the-top sci-fi themes and becoming somewhat laughable.\n\nOne thing that does keep you watching is the calibre of the acting, which is top dollar. Ashley Judd is a fine piece of casting as the put-upon, run-down heroine, and she lends this film a sense of gravitas that would have otherwise been missing. Michael Shannon is a scene-stealer, his quirky, paranoid war veteran one of the most charming performances I've seen in the past few years, and there's a neat extended cameo from Harry Connick Jr, too.\n\nThe film has plenty of strong moments, a few bits of nasty violence, and a rather silly climax. It all mixes together into a rather unsatisfactory brew by the end, but hey, at least it's different.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-03-05","keywords":"breast sucking,power of suggestion,based on play,male frontal nudity,bare breasts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bug (2006)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2126250265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEzZDJjZjMtMzA4OC00ZGJmLWE2ZjgtYTc2OWI4NDcxYmRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEzZDJjZjMtMzA4OC00ZGJmLWE2ZjgtYTc2OWI4NDcxYmRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Lionsgate"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0788335/","name":"Michael Shannon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001065/","name":"Harry Connick Jr."}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001243/","name":"William Friedkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093132/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312746/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504832/","name":"Tracy Letts"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Als er nun mit einem Außenteam zurückkehrt, trifft er auf einen absolut identischen Doppelgänger. Der Mann behauptet sogar, selbst Will Riker zu sein. Es stellt sich heraus, dass der Commander durch eine Transporterfehlfunktion zweimal materialisiert wurde. Es dauert nicht lange, bis es zwischen den beiden Rikers zu Spannungen kommt.</desc>
