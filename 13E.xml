In this case the reprehensible, degrading and evil treatment of women by segments of men whose actions can only be described as vile, caustic, inhuman and downright evil. So many viewers sadly glossed over this fundamental issue. Sadly.\n\nOf course we can give our views on whether there were too few episodes or not enough, or how true or not the events depicted relate to what actually happened, or whether the director or production team or actors excelled themselves or not. For me, they were all excellent. But that is to miss the point: murder is never justified under ANY circumstances. No matter your family or cultural upbringing. No matter your religion or any other justification. That a young girl ( or anyone for that matter ) should be so inhumanly and despicably treated - culminating in her murder - is something which should outrage all of us...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2063,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-09-28","keywords":"missing woman,police,london england,2000s,based on true story","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0369954/","name":"Keeley Hawes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4440305/","name":"Mark Stanley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1106960/","name":"Michael Jibson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0677560/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0752152/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0685539/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Honour","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi193249561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDYwZmFmNjktYWIxMi00ZGQwLTk2ODAtNTE1MGM3Y2QxNjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDYwZmFmNjktYWIxMi00ZGQwLTk2ODAtNTE1MGM3Y2QxNjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Honour"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In this case the reprehensible, degrading and evil treatment of women by segments of men whose actions can only be described as vile, caustic, inhuman and downright evil. So many viewers sadly glossed over this fundamental issue. Sadly.\n\nOf course we can give our views on whether there were too few episodes or not enough, or how true or not the events depicted relate to what actually happened, or whether the director or production team or actors excelled themselves or not. For me, they were all excellent. But that is to miss the point: murder is never justified under ANY circumstances. No matter your family or cultural upbringing. No matter your religion or any other justification. That a young girl ( or anyone for that matter ) should be so inhumanly and despicably treated - culminating in her murder - is something which should outrage all of us...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2063,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-09-28","keywords":"missing woman,police,london england,2000s,based on true story","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0369954/","name":"Keeley Hawes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4440305/","name":"Mark Stanley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1106960/","name":"Michael Jibson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0677560/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0752152/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0685539/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Honour","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi193249561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDYwZmFmNjktYWIxMi00ZGQwLTk2ODAtNTE1MGM3Y2QxNjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDYwZmFmNjktYWIxMi00ZGQwLTk2ODAtNTE1MGM3Y2QxNjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Honour"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It felt like I was watching the actual events happening, which we know from the news... The movie was very well directed and produced. P.S. It's best to ignore bernardconneely's review. His review is not about the movie itself but about politics and his own views on it. His review does not make sense whatsoever. It's just an outburst of his hatred for refugees and immigrants, and has nothing to do with the movie itself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":744,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-05-30","keywords":"road movie,male bonding,teenage boy,refugee,rv","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5255211/","name":"Stéphane Bak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001035/","name":"Ben Chaplin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771923/","name":"Sebastian Schipper"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0660230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061958/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164664/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771923/","name":"Sebastian Schipper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2047699/","name":"Oliver Ziegenbalg"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His last movie I saw, Mr. Brooks, was pretty good also. I would call this movie a political satire, that tries to be a little funny at times. However, the idea that one guy determines the presidential election is absurd, but if you can get past that, then the plot is OK. It was funny how the movie had the political parties doing adds for things they oppose. Example, the democrats supporting pro life because Bud says he's pro life.\n\nThe plot is struggling, every day man, Bud Johnson, just got laid off. He has a very smart daughter and she cares about the presidential election. Bud promises to vote since Molly thinks it's important. But, when he doesn't show, Molly votes in his place but the power goes out and the vote didn't count. The election comes down to New Mexico and for some reason, not told in the movie, Bud's vote will decide the electoral votes. I mean, how could the votes be even for each side and even if they were very close, how many months would it take for all the recounts that would take place.

His last movie I saw, Mr. Brooks, was pretty good also. I would call this movie a political satire, that tries to be a little funny at times. However, the idea that one guy determines the presidential election is absurd, but if you can get past that, then the plot is OK. It was funny how the movie had the political parties doing adds for things they oppose. Example, the democrats supporting pro life because Bud says he's pro life.\n\nThe plot is struggling, every day man, Bud Johnson, just got laid off. He has a very smart daughter and she cares about the presidential election. Bud promises to vote since Molly thinks it's important. But, when he doesn't show, Molly votes in his place but the power goes out and the vote didn't count. The election comes down to New Mexico and for some reason, not told in the movie, Bud's vote will decide the electoral votes. I mean, how could the votes be even for each side and even if they were very close, how many months would it take for all the recounts that would take place. But any way, it's up to Bud, whom doesn't care about politics. He becomes an instant celebrity and is courted by both candidates. By the end of the film, Bud grows an appreciation for the political scene and realizes that it is important to care about social issues.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Funnier than I thought and provides a message. Plus, the movie doesn't try to say that one party is better than the other.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18365,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-08-01","keywords":"awakened by one's daughter,father daughter relationship,presidential candidate,election returns,election coverage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Swing Vote","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2363687193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMDM1OTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMDM1OTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Swing Vote Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000126/","name":"Kevin Costner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745736/","name":"Paula Patton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001288/","name":"Kelsey Grammer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827750/","name":"Joshua Michael Stern"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0237137/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0725034/","name":"Jason Richman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827750/","name":"Joshua Michael Stern","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1250389/","name":"David Giammarco"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Seems someone wants him to find a mysterious white lady in a blue dress (Jennifer Beals)who's thought to have been seen in a blacks-only club.

It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.\n\nWhen it's revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it's not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns ..\n\nThe early 90s saw the "Woman from Hell" back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the "Mad Bitch" sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder's (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-08-14","keywords":"female star appears nude,roommate,female nudity,bound and gagged,woman in bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2455550745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000492/","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001836/","name":"Steven Weber"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775447/","name":"Barbet Schroeder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661375/","name":"John Lutz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740400/","name":"Don Roos"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It really shows his versatility as an actor, not just a comic, and I loved the plot. An old fashioned movie with no bad language, sex or violence. It was extremely well cast and I really liked the old gentleman who lived in the basement of the theater and was so dignified. Every time I see him with his "Dog" I get a lump in my throat. Jim Carey plays such a caring role and his relationship with Harry is so warm and believable.The way he gets the town to rally around the Majestic is fun and wonderful. The woman who plays his lady-friend is beautiful and I wish I could see her in other movies. One of my favorite all time films.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53910,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-12-21","keywords":"mccarthyism,hollywood blacklist,hollywood,film industry,movie palace","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Majestic","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2431648025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAxZTRmZjUtNDhiNC00MzU1LWJhZTYtMTdiNDdhMTJhZDA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAxZTRmZjUtNDhiNC00MzU1LWJhZTYtMTdiNDdhMTJhZDA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001445/","name":"Martin Landau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000837/","name":"Bob Balaban"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001104/","name":"Frank Darabont"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024939/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007136/","name":"Michael Sloane"],"duration":"PT2H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But it seems unfair to compare a sequel to its predecessor when the film is a sequel in name only. Other than the opening which re-tracks the memorable final scenes from the original, FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE mostly flies solo. \n\nThe cast was excellent.

But it seems unfair to compare a sequel to its predecessor when the film is a sequel in name only. Other than the opening which re-tracks the memorable final scenes from the original, FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE mostly flies solo. \n\nThe cast was excellent. Robert Shaw and Edward Fox are good replacements to Gregory Peck and David Niven in the roles of Keith Mallory and Major Miller. Harrison Ford absolutely amazing as Lt. Col. Barnsby.

There's a lot of futuristic noir flourishes, the movie is bathing in neon light and seedy environments. This isn't new, its Blade Runner-esque but the cinematography is admittedly gorgeous in this. Just because it has been done before (lately with Altered Carbon and Mute) doesn't make it any less impressive. It was a nice touch and it deserves to be mentioned, even if it doesn't quite save the movie.\n\nThe plot of Terminal is very reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's movies. There's some Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels moments but the whole movie doesn't operate as well overall. We get introduced to a bunch of seedy characters with dubious morals. They all come in and out of this train station in the middle of the night and the common thread between them is the character of Annie (Margot Robbie). She's an assassin who works part-time as a waitress and stripper. Through her comings and goings, we meet a terminally ill teacher Bill (Simon Pegg), a pair of mismatched hitmen Vince (Dexter Fletcher) and Alfred (Max Irons) and an odd janitor Clinton (Mike Myers). How these interactions play into the larger plot is a mystery to us until the final turn. The setup isn't bad, we've seen it before and although there are plot holes, none of them were bad enough to completely derail the movie. It was enough to keep me interested but I did find my attention drifting in and out because of the lack of cohesion. As a story, its very middle of the road for the genre.\n\nAny heat for this movie was likely due to Margot Robbie's involvement as the main character. She keeps climbing the ladder and its deserved, she's great and I consider myself a fan of hers. She's good in Terminal, she's surprisingly committed, and she carries the movie capably. I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that she comes off as British Harley Quinn, but she didn't phone it in. Pegg is his typical charming self, he's very low-key in this but he works well with Robbie and I particularly enjoyed the montage that they share near the tail-end of the movie. Fletcher and Irons were odd, neither of them were terrible but Fletcher was over doing it and Irons was a little stiff. It was nice to see Mike Myers again and I think he did about as well as he could have with the material. Its a big distance from where his character starts to where he ends up and it makes his performance a little awkward by the end.\n\nI was down the middle on Terminal for most of its run time for all the reasons listed above. It was never stellar, but it had its moments. I was more than ready to just let it float the rest of the way to whatever normal twist ending it had up its sleeve and call it a day. But when the confrontation comes between Annie and Bill, the movie doesn't just dip its toes into a pool of nonsense/crazy, it cannonballs into it. I wasn't just snickering, I was laughing when Terminal ended. Its not that the twist it takes is new, its handled in such a rough and implausible manner that I was shocked. But it didn't derail the movie for me, it actually improved it. It made Terminal memorable and while I would never say that this movie is good, its going to hold a place in my memory for insane plot twists.\n\nI feel a little guilty for giving Terminal as high of a rating as I have. I liked the style of the movie and some of the performances (notably Robbie, Pegg and some of Myers) were solid. But it never reached high enough for something great and in any other movie, that twist ending would have knocked it down to a 3 or a 4/10. But that ending pushed the movie from mediocre to so bad its good territory for me. I can't call Terminal excellent but if you enjoy campy cinema, this is something you should see. I'm giving Terminal a 6/10 and I feel like I'm being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-11","keywords":"bare chested male bondage,tied to a bed,revenge,written by director,wager","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi671922201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, 'Terminal' follows the twisting tales of two assassins carrying out a sinister mission, a teacher battling a fatal illness, an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress leading a dangerous double life.

It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.\n\nWhen it's revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it's not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns ..\n\nThe early 90s saw the "Woman from Hell" back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the "Mad Bitch" sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder's (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-08-14","keywords":"female star appears nude,roommate,female nudity,bound and gagged,woman in bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2455550745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000492/","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001836/","name":"Steven Weber"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775447/","name":"Barbet Schroeder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661375/","name":"John Lutz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740400/","name":"Don Roos"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.\n\nWhen it's revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it's not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns ..\n\nThe early 90s saw the "Woman from Hell" back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the "Mad Bitch" sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder's (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-08-14","keywords":"female star appears nude,roommate,female nudity,bound and gagged,woman in bathtub","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2455550745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000492/","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001836/","name":"Steven Weber"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775447/","name":"Barbet Schroeder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661375/","name":"John Lutz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740400/","name":"Don Roos"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sorry Madge.\n\n--Shelly","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":819272,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-09-01","keywords":"diamond,boxer,narrated by character,fight,boxing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Snatch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1558577433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334318/","name":"Stephen Graham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He goes alone and stumbles on to a circus and a beautiful female bear named Ursa. Switching places with a male bear named Doug, his friends in the forest soon become worried.\n\nThe reviews for this film are not stellar, and I think I can sum up why: the original voice cast is not involved in this picture, so the characters sound funny. The plot is thin, and the movie comes in under 90 minutes, letting you know that they didn't have a strong story (even including the dogs and cats seems forced because it is not related to the main story at all).\n\nFor me, I liked the film. I don't have a strong attachment to the original, so I wasn't as offended. And I think kids will like it. Sure, the voice for Boog was annoying... but then, I loved the dogs and cats, so it's a toss-up.

He goes alone and stumbles on to a circus and a beautiful female bear named Ursa. Switching places with a male bear named Doug, his friends in the forest soon become worried.\n\nThe reviews for this film are not stellar, and I think I can sum up why: the original voice cast is not involved in this picture, so the characters sound funny. The plot is thin, and the movie comes in under 90 minutes, letting you know that they didn't have a strong story (even including the dogs and cats seems forced because it is not related to the main story at all).\n\nFor me, I liked the film. I don't have a strong attachment to the original, so I wasn't as offended. And I think kids will like it. Sure, the voice for Boog was annoying... but then, I loved the dogs and cats, so it's a toss-up. I felt like this was going to be a launching pad for a TV series, because it has a "Madagascar" feel to it... but with its poor reception, that may not be likely.\n\nIf you have kids, let them check it out.

Making Band aid a feel-good type watch that isn't taxing at all, a very easy watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2017-06-09","keywords":"husband wife relationship,rock band,garage band,guitar,drummer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3432888601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjcwNTU3MzEtMWNhNi00Nzk0LWIyZWEtNmIzNDBlZDUzZDMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjcwNTU3MzEtMWNhNi00Nzk0LWIyZWEtNmIzNDBlZDUzZDMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A couple who can't stop fighting decide to write songs and start a band in a last ditch move to save their relationship.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830380/","name":"Zoe Lister-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1269723/","name":"Adam Pally","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0035488/","name":"Fred Armisen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830380/","name":"Zoe Lister-Jones"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484440/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555595/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830380/","name":"Zoe Lister-Jones"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies.

But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"police detective,barricading a door,injection in leg,taser,attacked with a knife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286163225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","description":"A haunted family struggles to uncover a terrifying secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world in Insidious: Chapter 2.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001347/","name":"Barbara Hershey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is also a very awkward racial or ethnic conflict which I did not understand at all, it just felt super forced.\n\nIt's not spectacular, it's not gory and fun, it's not original in any way, so while I can say that it was a film, I can't think of a reason for anyone to watch it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.1,"genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2021-06-02","keywords":"nightmare,bare chested male,shark attack,boat,shark","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4129669145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0ZTFmOTItMzBlNi00ZDJjLTgyNWEtNmE2YWNkYTNiOWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0ZTFmOTItMzBlNi00ZDJjLTgyNWEtNmE2YWNkYTNiOWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"A blissful tourist trip turns into a nightmare when five seaplane passengers are stranded miles from shore.

In this case it is the boy who returns to the small town, but the girl is still uptight - only mildly, and it is her that has the folksy job. Horrendously predictable with the the expected conflict, but the conflict happened later on and wasn't nearly as bad as expected. In a way I liked having a film that just followed a relationship without too much conflict. It gave a sense of realism to how relationships usually progress. Watch this on it is sweet. The trivia says that the two leads at the time were engaged and you can see the realism in their chemistry which was nice - and also without the wince knowing one or both of the actors are married to someone else in real life. (Maybe I am weird, but I did do that while watching a different rom com last night.)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-04-28","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One of a Kind Love","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1855701017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRiMjYxYWItNzdmNy00YTk3LWIyYjktYjg3ZDNiMTk2YWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRiMjYxYWItNzdmNy00YTk3LWIyYjktYjg3ZDNiMTk2YWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance/Comedy TV Movie\nStarring Jocelyne Hudon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6749397/","name":"Jocelyn Hudon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4889489/","name":"Jake Manley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8544044/","name":"Daniela Sandiford"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3560439/","name":"Philippe Lupien"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228741/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1672013/","name":"Barbara Kymlicka"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In this case it is the boy who returns to the small town, but the girl is still uptight - only mildly, and it is her that has the folksy job. Horrendously predictable with the the expected conflict, but the conflict happened later on and wasn't nearly as bad as expected. In a way I liked having a film that just followed a relationship without too much conflict. It gave a sense of realism to how relationships usually progress. Watch this on it is sweet. The trivia says that the two leads at the time were engaged and you can see the realism in their chemistry which was nice - and also without the wince knowing one or both of the actors are married to someone else in real life. (Maybe I am weird, but I did do that while watching a different rom com last night.)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-04-28","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One of a Kind Love","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1855701017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRiMjYxYWItNzdmNy00YTk3LWIyYjktYjg3ZDNiMTk2YWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRiMjYxYWItNzdmNy00YTk3LWIyYjktYjg3ZDNiMTk2YWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance/Comedy TV Movie\nStarring Jocelyne Hudon","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6749397/","name":"Jocelyn Hudon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4889489/","name":"Jake Manley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8544044/","name":"Daniela Sandiford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3560439/","name":"Philippe Lupien"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228741/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1672013/","name":"Barbara Kymlicka"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Equipped with a half-empty bottle of water, a digital camera, some rope and a (very) dull blade, Ralston must take stock of the situation and figure out a way to escape.\n\nThe film is tight, pacey and not nearly as boring as it could have been in the hands of a more literal director. Danny Boyle and co. infuse every scene with energy, wowing viewers with panoramic cinematography and drilling the hard truths home when the time comes.\n\nRalston gets his arm trapped a mere 15 minutes in and from then on it's Man vs. Rock. Boyle brings his distinctive brand of energy to the potentially static set-up, with an unpredictable and often inspired soundtrack and the surreal tangents so successfully employed in his early classic, 'Trainspotting'.

Equipped with a half-empty bottle of water, a digital camera, some rope and a (very) dull blade, Ralston must take stock of the situation and figure out a way to escape.\n\nThe film is tight, pacey and not nearly as boring as it could have been in the hands of a more literal director. Danny Boyle and co. infuse every scene with energy, wowing viewers with panoramic cinematography and drilling the hard truths home when the time comes.\n\nRalston gets his arm trapped a mere 15 minutes in and from then on it's Man vs. Rock. Boyle brings his distinctive brand of energy to the potentially static set-up, with an unpredictable and often inspired soundtrack and the surreal tangents so successfully employed in his early classic, 'Trainspotting'. Though Ralston himself may not move, his mind wanders through old memories and viewers are transported with him.\n\nBoyle has a talent for finding the life-affirming elements hidden deep within grim situations and '127 Hours' is nothing if not an exercise in hope and determination.

Most married couples can probably relate to the grind of a life absorbed with work and parenting. Sometimes the fantasy turns into having a quiet moment of solitude. Heck, even "date night" can devolve into just another responsibility tacked on at the end of a long week. This is the premise for director Shawn Levy's film. The best part? It doesn't matter at all.\n\nThe reason this film works is not the plot or script, but rather the talents of the two funniest people in showbiz today: Steve Carell and Tina Fey. The two seem to have an exceptional comedic connection that brings out a timing that reminds of the best comedy teams of all time.\n\nSometimes what makes for the funniest comedy is putting "normal" people into exceptional situations and let them react. Here, Carell and Fey are just a typical suburban couple trying to re-ignite the luster of an all too comfortable marriage. The motivation comes when their friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) announce they are splitting.

The multitude of skits that follow include supporting work from dirty cops (Common and Jimmi Simpson), the real reservation holders (funny James Franco and Mila Kunis), a mob boss (Ray Liotta), a corrupt city official (William Fichtner) and a "security expert" in the eternally shirtless Mark Wahlberg.\n\nThe approach of the film reminds me of "After Hours", "Adventures in Babysitting" and "The Out of Towners". Some of the best comedy occurs when the main players aren't tossing out incessant one-liners. Think back to Cary Grant's screwball comedies. He was not a bumbling idiot or a stand-up comedian walking through life. His characters were reactionary to the odd-ball situations in which he was placed. That is the approach of Carell and Fey, and I hope they pursue future projects together.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158357,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-04-09","keywords":"downtown,desire,thug,criminal,kingpin","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Date Night: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2353399065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, a case of mistaken identity turns a bored married couple's attempt at a glamorous and romantic evening into something more thrilling and dangerous."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458441/","name":"Josh Klausner"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

My wife and I are in a similar situation, older, retired, and long-time married. Our daily life and conversations are not that different from what is depicted here.\n\nLesley Manville (early 60s) is Joan and Liam Neeson (late 60s) is her husband Tom. As the movie begins they are on one of their walks, her short legs must move almost twice as fast as his. After they cross the bridge and get to a certain tree they turn around and head back.

Well directed, well acted -- priceless comic performances by Pesci, Tomei, Gwynne &amp; Austin Pendleton. And more than comedy -- there's also a lot of genuine pathos and real tension and drama, especially in the final courtroom scene. And I really don't understand the "controversy" or brouhaha over Marisa Tomei receiving the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in this movie. It's a crackerjack gem of a performance and a stellar comic portrayal. The only thing I can figure is that a lot of snobbery about serious dramatic portrayals somehow being more worthy of honor than great comic performances still very much lives on in much of the film community.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116045,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1992-03-13","keywords":"lawyer,trial,italian american,alabama,jail","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"My Cousin Vinny","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2744844569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc2NWI4YjctMWVhMy00MGViLTk5NzQtZGMwYWY3MzQwZWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc2NWI4YjctMWVhMy00MGViLTk5NzQtZGMwYWY3MzQwZWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000673/","name":"Marisa Tomei"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057987/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0731057/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0490958/","name":"Dale Launer"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well directed, well acted -- priceless comic performances by Pesci, Tomei, Gwynne &amp; Austin Pendleton. And more than comedy -- there's also a lot of genuine pathos and real tension and drama, especially in the final courtroom scene. And I really don't understand the "controversy" or brouhaha over Marisa Tomei receiving the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in this movie. It's a crackerjack gem of a performance and a stellar comic portrayal. The only thing I can figure is that a lot of snobbery about serious dramatic portrayals somehow being more worthy of honor than great comic performances still very much lives on in much of the film community.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116045,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1992-03-13","keywords":"lawyer,trial,italian american,alabama,jail","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"My Cousin Vinny","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2744844569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc2NWI4YjctMWVhMy00MGViLTk5NzQtZGMwYWY3MzQwZWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc2NWI4YjctMWVhMy00MGViLTk5NzQtZGMwYWY3MzQwZWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000673/","name":"Marisa Tomei","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057987/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0731057/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0490958/","name":"Dale Launer"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

The first one is a crime story, which constitutes the framework of the film. In the course of events, another theme appears - psychological experiences of the main character. Vivid blend of picture with sound and music will draw the audience into the deepest recesses of Marek's mind, making the viewers face questions: What is reality and what is only an illusion?

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0805580, Title: Palimpsest, 
 --- Description: Palimpsest: Directed by Konrad Niewolski. With Andrzej Chyra, Magdalena Cielecka, Robert Gonera, Tomasz Sapryk. Marek, the main character of "Palimpsest," is a police inspector, a man on the verge of psychological disintegration trying to solve an intricate case. The story is told on two planes. The first one is a crime story, which constitutes the framework of the film. In the course of events, another theme appears - psychological experiences of the main character. Vivid blend of picture with sound and music will draw the audience into the deepest recesses of Marek's mind, making the viewers face questions: What is reality and what is only an illusion? Where is the borderline between the real world and our perception of it? What makes suffering meaningful and what is really important in one's life"?" data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0805580/","name":"Palimpsest","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDg3Njg2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk4NTk5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Marek, the main character of "Palimpsest," is a police inspector, a man on the verge of psychological disintegration trying to solve an intricate case.

In it what can be cured with a simple apology, yet out of arrogance escalates into a hellish nightmare as the woman's whole life becomes a target of the man's rage.

This film tells a real dramatic event, which even today opens wounds and consequences in the families of the victims, poor families that have not yet received real reparation from the state of Chile. Organizations for the protection of women in Chile are condemning this production that profits from this tragedy and is once again re-victimizing the case and affecting even more the families of the girls and women who suffered this real tragedy. That's horrible!

My horse is getting tired."","reviewBody":"James Cameron has directed some fantastic action movies during his career (Aliens, the first two Terminator movies, The Abyss, Titanic--that boat action was like totally awesome!!), but none were as funny as True Lies is. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum.

My horse is getting tired."","reviewBody":"James Cameron has directed some fantastic action movies during his career (Aliens, the first two Terminator movies, The Abyss, Titanic--that boat action was like totally awesome!!), but none were as funny as True Lies is. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies.

It's not glaringly awful, and actually seems to work fairly well in a movie about abstract craziness that features time-traveling dolphins.\n\nIt's fun, plain and simple. The children in the audience we're giggling with delight, the adults found humor enough to laugh, and all in all I appreciated the blatant references to movies like Mad Max, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and The Shining. It's a movie that is directed at children, but is enriched with plenty of adult humor in the form of puns and famous movies references. \n\nJust enjoy it for what it is and you won't be disappointed.

It takes place in a fantasy world, created by the talented duo, Frank Oz and Jim Henson.  Everything in this film is so meticulously done, that it still lives on to this day. Computer effects be damned.  This film has texture, and it is pleasing to watch. This movie, as you will see, was made for kids.  But really, it is a masterpiece in film-making.  True, good, story-telling.  Sure, kids will love it, but the film isn't really aimed at them like most kid movies are. It is complicated, eerie, beautiful, and intelligent... most of all, mystical. I reccomend this to anyone seriously interested in film, especially fantasy... not to be missed!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1982-12-17","keywords":"puppetry,magical crystal,crystal shard,cult favorite,puppet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi629389593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDEzMjBjM2QtN2Y0Mi00ZGY4LTgzZTYtYTQwZWZiYzIyMjc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDEzMjBjM2QtN2Y0Mi00ZGY4LTgzZTYtYTQwZWZiYzIyMjc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rediscover the age of wonder inspired by Jim Henson's groundbreaking vision.

My horse is getting tired."","reviewBody":"James Cameron has directed some fantastic action movies during his career (Aliens, the first two Terminator movies, The Abyss, Titanic--that boat action was like totally awesome!!), but none were as funny as True Lies is. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"}],"duration":"PT2H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: True Lies: Directed by James Cameron. With Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton.

My horse is getting tired."","reviewBody":"James Cameron has directed some fantastic action movies during his career (Aliens, the first two Terminator movies, The Abyss, Titanic--that boat action was like totally awesome!!), but none were as funny as True Lies is. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"],"duration":"PT2H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's not glaringly awful, and actually seems to work fairly well in a movie about abstract craziness that features time-traveling dolphins.\n\nIt's fun, plain and simple. The children in the audience we're giggling with delight, the adults found humor enough to laugh, and all in all I appreciated the blatant references to movies like Mad Max, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and The Shining. It's a movie that is directed at children, but is enriched with plenty of adult humor in the form of puns and famous movies references. \n\nJust enjoy it for what it is and you won't be disappointed.

Favolacce deliverd this force, in a unique way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6911,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-06-15","keywords":"unhappy family,disfunctional family,rome italy,disturbing,malaise","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1897774617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDVkZjQxODYtZjllYi00ZTU4LWEyZTctN2Q5YWYwZDljNjA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDVkZjQxODYtZjllYi00ZTU4LWEyZTctN2Q5YWYwZDljNjA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314554/","name":"Elio Germano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10971622/","name":"Tommaso Di Cola","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8584079/","name":"Giulietta Rebeggiani"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4462605/","name":"Damiano D'Innocenzo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461870/","name":"Fabio D'Innocenzo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0380415/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066197/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0280251/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4462605/","name":"Damiano D'Innocenzo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461870/","name":"Fabio D'Innocenzo"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Confusing psychodrama and reality as if there is no difference says something disturbing about the Japanese sense of self. Any Westerner would find such a practice a disturbing and offensive intrusion into and offensive parody of their personal integrity.\n\nIn the West we can accept role-playing dramas, which often have satisfying or even cathartic effects, because the illusion is a temporary imaginary leap, and the experience an exercise in self-analysis and mindfulness. Lessons are drawn which can be applied back in one's real life, having been a recreation that strengthens our emotional life, just as physical exercise strengthens our body. Well-written dramas can also impart this kind of creative refreshment. But the Japanese acceptance of play-acting as essentially indistinguishable from actuality, and as having the identical moral standing of authentic behaviour, is surely a dangerous category confusion? This seems to be exposed as the film shows the difficulty the man finds in posing convincingly as the father of a young child while at the same time keeping his emotional distance - as it is stipulated he must as a condition of his employment. One thinks in the West of those unpleasant consequences where undercover security operations have led to the betrayal of the emotions and the lives of partners whom agents have fallen in love with, even married and had children by, in the guise of an entirely false persona. Court cases have tended to follow.\n\nOne can speculate that this disturbing insincerity, which can so easily turn into real but still cheating feelings, is only tolerable in a society and culture that within living memory was still highly formalised according to strict traditional imperatives, that dictated not only the physical but also, to an extreme degree, the interior life of the people. This deprived thought and action of any moral component, producing a culture - as is well known - of shame, instead of guilt; of dissimulation, not confession.\n\nA society that recently valued only mere correct appearance remains vulnerable to such imposture, treating what we would deem impostors and deceivers exactly like authentic persons. If the Japanese still lack, to some degree, the moral centre to distinguish between mere artifice and psychological integrity, then their obsession with automata as acceptable simulacra of human beings, even without application of any Turing test to demonstrate actual sentience, is indicative.\n\nI don't say the Japanese have no modern sensibility, of course.

 --- Description: Family Romance, LLC: Directed by Werner Herzog. With Ishii Yuichi, Mahiro Tanimoto, Miki Fujimaki, Takashi Nakatani. A man is hired to impersonate the missing father of a young girl." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10208194/","name":"Family Romance, LLC","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZhYjc1NjAtNzgzYy00OGQzLWI5ZDAtMWU2ZjI3OTljZTY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY0MDM5Njk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A man is hired to impersonate the missing father of a young girl.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt10208194/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"philip-davies31","dateCreated":"2020-07-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"Japan's culture is still very strange to us.","reviewBody":"Surely that utterly dishonest Japanese substitution and impersonation of real persons in real situations is just weird, and wrong? Confusing psychodrama and reality as if there is no difference says something disturbing about the Japanese sense of self. Any Westerner would find such a practice a disturbing and offensive intrusion into and offensive parody of their personal integrity.\n\nIn the West we can accept role-playing dramas, which often have satisfying or even cathartic effects, because the illusion is a temporary imaginary leap, and the experience an exercise in self-analysis and mindfulness. Lessons are drawn which can be applied back in one's real life, having been a recreation that strengthens our emotional life, just as physical exercise strengthens our body. Well-written dramas can also impart this kind of creative refreshment. But the Japanese acceptance of play-acting as essentially indistinguishable from actuality, and as having the identical moral standing of authentic behaviour, is surely a dangerous category confusion? This seems to be exposed as the film shows the difficulty the man finds in posing convincingly as the father of a young child while at the same time keeping his emotional distance - as it is stipulated he must as a condition of his employment. One thinks in the West of those unpleasant consequences where undercover security operations have led to the betrayal of the emotions and the lives of partners whom agents have fallen in love with, even married and had children by, in the guise of an entirely false persona. Court cases have tended to follow.\n\nOne can speculate that this disturbing insincerity, which can so easily turn into real but still cheating feelings, is only tolerable in a society and culture that within living memory was still highly formalised according to strict traditional imperatives, that dictated not only the physical but also, to an extreme degree, the interior life of the people. This deprived thought and action of any moral component, producing a culture - as is well known - of shame, instead of guilt; of dissimulation, not confession.\n\nA society that recently valued only mere correct appearance remains vulnerable to such imposture, treating what we would deem impostors and deceivers exactly like authentic persons. If the Japanese still lack, to some degree, the moral centre to distinguish between mere artifice and psychological integrity, then their obsession with automata as acceptable simulacra of human beings, even without application of any Turing test to demonstrate actual sentience, is indicative.\n\nI don't say the Japanese have no modern sensibility, of course. After the terrible debacle, in the Second World War, of their unique traditional world-view, they have finally entered the moral universe. However, it seems they do retain a residual psychological tendency that remains susceptible to mere appearances. This has led them seriously astray (I suggest) in the current practice, as it is shown by this interesting Herzog film, 'Family Romance.'","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-07-03","keywords":"father,rent,japan,cherry blossom,taking a photograph","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1826995225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVkYjI1NzQtY2ZlOC00NzQyLWJjN2ItYmEzZDIxNWFiMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVkYjI1NzQtY2ZlOC00NzQyLWJjN2ItYmEzZDIxNWFiMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A man is hired to impersonate the missing father of a 12 year old girl.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10348089/","name":"Ishii Yuichi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10640857/","name":"Mahiro Tanimoto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11334855/","name":"Miki Fujimaki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001348/","name":"Werner Herzog"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0361457/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001348/","name":"Werner Herzog"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has amazing acting from both the actresses . Sarah Paulson was creepy and the girl who played her daughter ( can't remember her name ) was spectacular !!

The Rock played a real good part and he certainly has a bright future in the acting industry. The beautiful Kelly Hu showed that she can be good on the big screen and the ever reliable Michael Clarke Duncan played a great part as well. The action scenes were hard hitting and brutal and the scenery was fantastic as well.\n\nThe only thing that spoiled the film for me was the fact that it was not an original idea. The plot has been done in so many movies before. Sometimes in the movie world, certain plots are churned out time and time again and you just get that feeling of deja vu. The plot for this film has been done in dozens of movies and countless TV shows.\n\nI saw this film with a friend of mine and he really really enjoyed it. However, he usually likes cop movies and hasn't seen many fantasy adventure movies so watching this was a first for him. I have seen dozens of movies like this and whilst it was very good, I did get that feeling of familiarity.\n\nBut anyway, I still recommend it. The fight scenes are awesome and there are some funny scenes in it. And again, the Rock does have a future as an actor. I just hope that his next project is a fresh idea.\n\nI'm going to really be awkward here but there's three other things that bothered me about this movie. There was a short scene with an Indian elephant in. Did ancient Egypt have elephants? I'm no wildlife expert but I didn't think they did. Secondly, wasn't it amazing that there was such a variety of accents in the film. Lastly, gunpowder in ancient Egypt? No way!\n\nI'm just getting old though-watch and enjoy!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135123,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-04-19","keywords":"sorceress,desert,king,showdown,shared universe","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104526/","name":"Steven Brand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003817/","name":"Michael Clarke Duncan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751080/","name":"Chuck Russell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075836/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355054/","name":"Jonathan Hales"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651758/","name":"William Osborne"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The plot has been done in so many movies before. Sometimes in the movie world, certain plots are churned out time and time again and you just get that feeling of deja vu. The plot for this film has been done in dozens of movies and countless TV shows.\n\nI saw this film with a friend of mine and he really really enjoyed it. However, he usually likes cop movies and hasn't seen many fantasy adventure movies so watching this was a first for him. I have seen dozens of movies like this and whilst it was very good, I did get that feeling of familiarity.\n\nBut anyway, I still recommend it. The fight scenes are awesome and there are some funny scenes in it. And again, the Rock does have a future as an actor. I just hope that his next project is a fresh idea.\n\nI'm going to really be awkward here but there's three other things that bothered me about this movie. There was a short scene with an Indian elephant in. Did ancient Egypt have elephants? I'm no wildlife expert but I didn't think they did. Secondly, wasn't it amazing that there was such a variety of accents in the film. Lastly, gunpowder in ancient Egypt? No way!\n\nI'm just getting old though-watch and enjoy!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135123,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-04-19","keywords":"sorceress,desert,king,showdown,shared universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104526/","name":"Steven Brand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003817/","name":"Michael Clarke Duncan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751080/","name":"Chuck Russell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075836/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355054/","name":"Jonathan Hales","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651758/","name":"William Osborne"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So I'll not dwell on that and instead talk of the film!  The pitch was enough to get me interested  `man is held in phone box by sniper'  sounds great!

The only issue for me was accepting why the sniper was doing it and how he was able to get access to the equipment he would have needed as well as the information  not to mention the WILL to do it!  Also little things bugged me, but the film carries itself over these obstacles well enough and reservations are soon forgotten.  It sounds simple but the simple ideas work best and, although low on action (sorry, teen boys!) it is driven by dialogue and simply not knowing what will come next.\n\nThe direction helps the film by constantly moving and using split screens etc to give the impression that a lot is going on at once  again making the film feel like it has a fast pace.  It feels a little gimmicky (especially now that we've had 2 series of 24 doing the same thing) but it works regardless.  I wrote in an old review (8mm I think) that I would never pay to see a Joel Schumacher film ever again, and I DIDN'T pay to see Phone Booth!  However I was surprised because he didn't ruin it!  He did a good job  yes,  you heard me!  His usual excesses seem to have been controlled by a good producer and editing team and the film works  much to my surprise and relief!\n\nFarrell may not be a bona-fide Hollywood star yet but he takes the task of being onscreen for almost the whole film and runs with it.  He makes a comically cruel character someone that reveals himself to be a loser but never loses the audience  and that takes talent.  Sutherland's voice on the trailer didn't work for me (too normal and slow) but in the film he is excellent, like the director said, no-one else could have done the role, he is right for it.

    <desc lang="pl">Frankie Go Boom: Directed by Jordan Roberts. With Charlie Hunnam, Nora Dunn, Sam Anderson, Chris O'Dowd. Frank Bartlett has been tortured, embarrassed, and humiliated by his brother Bruce -- usually on film -- his entire life. Now that Bruce is finally off drugs and has turned his life around, things should be different.

Now that Bruce is finally off drugs and has turned his life around, things should be different. They are not.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1772271/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"brando647"},"dateCreated":"2013-08-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"A Few Fun Moments but It Tries Too Hard","reviewBody":"Every so often, you'll find a fun little independent comedy that comes along and blows every mainstream, nation-wide release out of the water for that year. FRANKIE GO BOOM is not one of these movies. It is a comedy and it does have a little bit of fun to it, but for the most part the movie is one of those middle of the road mediocre comedies that will easily find itself forgotten before it's ever really noticed. This is what makes FRANKIE GO BOOM so disappointing: it's not good and it's not bad enough to be fun. Watching this movie, I cracked a few smiles and might have even chuckled a few times but, when I try to remember any particular standout moment from the movie, I only come up with the nightmarish image of Ron Perlman's butt. This is not the response a good comedy wants from its audience. For those unaware, FRANKIE GO BOOM is about a writer (the titular Frankie, played by Charlie Hunnam) and his ex-drug addict, aspiring filmmaker brother Bruce (Chris O'Dowd). Frankie is called home from his isolated trailer in the middle of Death Valley, where he lives after having been humiliated at his own wedding by his brother. Bruce has spent his entire life tormenting his brother on film, and Frankie is horrified to discover that his brother hasn't given up his film obsession. He almost believes that Bruce might've changed his ways but a chance meeting with a beautiful woman (Lizzy Caplan) and a night of problematic loving leads to the realization that Bruce might've caught the entire embarrassing event on tape. And soon that tape makes its to the Internet and the hands of Bruce's unstable fellow recovering addict (Chris Noth) who happens to be that woman's father. Prepare for a forgettable adventure as Frankie and Bruce try to stop that tape from ruining Frankie's budding relationship or, you know, getting them killed at the hands of a violent psychopath.\n\nI needed a second viewing to determine that this movie wasn't just offensively boring. There are a few funny moments here. I don't remember exactly where they were though. The movie is filled with things that expected to be funny, just because. You might need an example to understand what I'm talking about: Jack, Bruce's addict/actor friend, owns a pet pig. Pigs are funny, yes? Not enough? All right, the pig is launched into a pool and proceeds to throw up on Frankie before his date with Lassie (Lizzy Caplan's character, not the collie). There's no real joke. Just a pig nearly drowning and then puking on Frankie. I get the same vibe from Ron Perlman's character, a post-op transgender ex-convict named Phyllis. We're supposed to laugh because it's Rob Perlman, an admittedly rough-looking dude, in drag. Very bad drag. Phyllis goes on to chat about his/her former genitals kept in a jar and becoming very upset when Frankie doesn't want to see them. This is the whole joke: a particularly unattractive transgender person pushing an uncomfortable man into seeing his pickled junk. There are a lot of little moments like this in the movie, and it doesn't make for a real laugh-out-loud sort of comedy.\n\nIt's a shame this movie is so tame because the ingredients are all there for a real fun time. Chris O'Dowd is great. I've been catch more and more of his work since first seeing him as the love interest in BRIDESMAIDS (for the record, the BBC's "The IT Crowd" is great). The problem with his character Bruce is that he's, you know, a sociopath. You almost become as frustrated watching him as Frankie does dealing with him. I find it hard to believe that Bruce doesn't understand the problem with what he does. He becomes a caricature. So does Frankie. Frankie (Hunnam) is pretty one-dimensional. He's just the 'frustrated sibling'  grumbling, sighing, and throwing his hands into the air in exasperation. He doesn't bring anything interesting to the character, though I imagine that's more the writer/director Jordan Roberts' fault. There is no depth to the characters and the movie plods along from gag to gag while eliciting no more than a few chuckles. FRANKIE GOES BOOM wants to be a comedy in the vein of HAROLD &amp; KUMAR but it doesn't come close. The one element of the film that goes so far as to aggravate me is the nonsensical resolution. We spend the entire movie with these two clowns as they chase down anyone that might be able to help them take the movie off-line and prevent Jack from seeing it, and the ending we're given makes no sense whatsoever. I can tell Roberts must have had some problems coming up with a good ending for his movie, so he had a few drinks to help him finish it and just shot whatever ramblings he woke up to in the morning.\n\nFRANKIE GO BOOM is a movie that has come and gone before most people probably had a chance to realize it existed. There is a lot of potential here and it sucks to see it go nowhere, especially when there are some talent people in the cast. Frankie doesn't go boom because FRANKIE is, well, a dud.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-10","keywords":"jock strap,male objectification,bare chested male,masturbation reference,name in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3001918745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MDI1Njg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3MDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MDI1Njg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3MDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Frank Bartlett has been tortured, embarrassed, and humiliated by his brother Bruce -- usually on film -- his entire life.

With big budget, big names, and John Woo going for it, "MI2" delivers solid entertainment but falls short of expectations. The film fails to make the emotional connection between audience and characters and apparently tries to compensate with an overdose of action. The result is a numbing experience and a yawn provoking ending as good triumphs over evil.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328091,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-05-24","keywords":"finger cut off,ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,time bomb,slit skirt","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779084/","name":"Dougray Scott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000247/","name":"John Woo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194528/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Mission accomplished!!!","reviewBody":"For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word "how". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.\n\nThis seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.\n\nMost reader's will come out of the theater saying "I wish they had shown this or that." However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a "good watch" but in this one we get a great movie.\n\nWe have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a non-reader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.\n\nA few highlights: The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, excellent (you'll love to hate her) and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girl(think Dead Milkmen here). And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium (she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin) as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix LeStrange.\n\nBattle scenes: breathtaking. Commraderie: The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.\n\nSee the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go. Leave having enjoyed a film that takes the beans and water and instead of a nice large coffee treats one to a perfectly concentrated, most artfully brewed and extremely tasty espresso. It has been said before but truth is truth: BEST YET!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":539737,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-08-15","keywords":"friendship,argus filch character,abusive uncle,bullying,albus dumbledore character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192310553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.\n\nThis seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.\n\nMost reader's will come out of the theater saying "I wish they had shown this or that." However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a "good watch" but in this one we get a great movie.\n\nWe have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a non-reader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.\n\nA few highlights: The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, excellent (you'll love to hate her) and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girl(think Dead Milkmen here). And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium (she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin) as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix LeStrange.\n\nBattle scenes: breathtaking. Commraderie: The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.\n\nSee the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go.

From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.\n\nCal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.\n\nThe intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.\n\nAfter moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him.

Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that's just the stuff I can tell you! Cal's first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual, Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton, but it's interesting to note (in real life) she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).\n\nAll of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey). Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that, it's on to the new Spider-Man for her.\n\nGlenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman, who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.\n\nNo question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men will relate to what's going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":495148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-29","keywords":"divorce,marriage,unfaithfulness,adultery,marital problem","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3722091801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Newly single Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is taken on as wingman and protÃ©gÃ© to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).

From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.\n\nCal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.\n\nThe intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.\n\nAfter moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.\n\nThe polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood - these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own.

So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how "pretty" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. \n\nOverall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture.

So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how "pretty" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. \n\nOverall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it.

Here she confronts us the viewers with what day-to-day life looks like for the millions of Syrians that have fled (were forced to flee) their home country resulting from the never-ending and brutal civil war, still going on to this very day. Everyone has heard of the Syrian refugees crisis, but I cannot immediately recall a prior in-depth attempt like this film at putting a human face on this terrible human tragedy. Watch for the incredible scene when Yasmin's 9 yr old daughter asks a bunch of penetrating questions to her mom, who then tries to give as comforting an answer as she can. At a certain point, the girl, now in tears, says "I don't want to go to Germany!' Just breaks your heart.\n\n"Simple As Water" premiered earlier this week on HBO and is now available on HBO On Demand and on HBO Max (where I caught it).

If you have any interest in the devastating effects of a refugee crisis the scale of which we have never seen before, I'd readily suggest you check out this deeply moving and human documentary, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-11-16","keywords":"meditation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi922010393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTEyYjgxZWEtYWY1MC00NjRmLWI2MjQtNGE3YTczYmQ0MDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTEyYjgxZWEtYWY1MC00NjRmLWI2MjQtNGE3YTczYmQ0MDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","description":"Simple As Water explores the impact of war, separation, and displacement, the film takes audiences into Syrian families' quests for normalcy and building a new life.

As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle ","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0455824/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Imdbidia"},"dateCreated":"2011-02-22","inLanguage":"English","name":"Old-style epic romantic movie","reviewBody":"An entertaining romantic drama by Buz Luhrmann, old-Hollywood style.\n\nThe movie is set in the Northern Territory of Australia in the years previous to the involvement of Japan in the WW II, and tells the story of Sarah Ashley -an English lady who goes to Australia to try to get her husband back to England and ends becoming the head of their Australian cattle farm-, Drover -an independent free-spirited cattle and horse drover that works for her- and Nullah -a half-caste Aboriginal child who lives in the farm and struggles to live in a world in which he's alien to both blacks and whites.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can say it is done as the movies of the golden era of Hollywood used to be - flashy wonderfully well-looking movie stars, great scenery and great studio settings, detailed recreation of the era's fashion, decoration, atmosphere, etc., , and a simple epic plot with a great love story. Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0455824, Title: Australia, 
 --- Description: Australia: Directed by Baz Luhrmann. With Shea Adams, Eddie Baroo, Ray Barrett, Tony Barry. Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscape, they experience the bombing of Darwin, Australia, by Japanese forces firsthand." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0455824/","name":"Australia","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJhMTAyZWMtMjRlZC00NWU3LTg3ODQtYTkyZjRiN2NhY2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle ","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0455824/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Imdbidia","dateCreated":"2011-02-22","inLanguage":"English","name":"Old-style epic romantic movie","reviewBody":"An entertaining romantic drama by Buz Luhrmann, old-Hollywood style.\n\nThe movie is set in the Northern Territory of Australia in the years previous to the involvement of Japan in the WW II, and tells the story of Sarah Ashley -an English lady who goes to Australia to try to get her husband back to England and ends becoming the head of their Australian cattle farm-, Drover -an independent free-spirited cattle and horse drover that works for her- and Nullah -a half-caste Aboriginal child who lives in the farm and struggles to live in a world in which he's alien to both blacks and whites.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can say it is done as the movies of the golden era of Hollywood used to be - flashy wonderfully well-looking movie stars, great scenery and great studio settings, detailed recreation of the era's fashion, decoration, atmosphere, etc., , and a simple epic plot with a great love story. Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is certainly an insult to the public, but - considering SATC was most popular in its later years - maybe the insult is much deserved.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114914,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"friendship between women,friendship,love life,casual sex,new york city","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters.

They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show.

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this.

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-04-11","keywords":"violence,prison,jakarta indonesia,kitchen fight,corrupt police officer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi530950937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Immediately following the events of the original, Officer Rama is pressured to join an anti-corruption task force to guarantee protection for his wife and child.

The movie even admits on a certain level that it's a fake by using footage from another horribly miscast biopic about Cole Porter, starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith! \n\nAnother review I've read mentions that: "At the first night parties there seemed a disproportionately high number of black people as guests, and also in other scenes." Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life, especially while in New York, was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary, there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's, shall we say..."Night Parties". Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then, start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued, there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search. For the time investment of a few simple key-strokes and mouse clicks, you'll be able to learn and truly appreciate more about Cole Porter, his life, his music and his genius, than this blanched, consumptive Kevin Kline vehicle could ever hope to provide."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.\n\nSUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.\n\nONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the "safe room scene". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":524952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2018-05-18","keywords":"anti hero,japanese girl,based on comic book,marvel comics,superhero","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2984557081","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YwNzViMzEtYTEyMS00MWIyLTkzY2UtZTRlMWViNTJlNGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YwNzViMzEtYTEyMS00MWIyLTkzY2UtZTRlMWViNTJlNGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Deadpool 2' is heading back to theaters for 12 days from Dec. 12, 2018, re-cut for a PG-13 audience.

It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.\n\nSUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.\n\nONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the "safe room scene". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":524952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2018-05-18","keywords":"anti hero,japanese girl,based on comic book,marvel comics,superhero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2984557081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YwNzViMzEtYTEyMS00MWIyLTkzY2UtZTRlMWViNTJlNGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YwNzViMzEtYTEyMS00MWIyLTkzY2UtZTRlMWViNTJlNGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Deadpool 2' is heading back to theaters for 12 days from Dec. 12, 2018, re-cut for a PG-13 audience.

The movie even admits on a certain level that it's a fake by using footage from another horribly miscast biopic about Cole Porter, starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith! \n\nAnother review I've read mentions that: "At the first night parties there seemed a disproportionately high number of black people as guests, and also in other scenes." Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life, especially while in New York, was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary, there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's, shall we say..."Night Parties". Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then, start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued, there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search.

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box.

A sex scene between her and the ever cool Matt Damon would have perked the movie up.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"revenge,casino,heist,comeuppance,hubris","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Thirteen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1654522137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002718/","name":"Brian Koppelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505522/","name":"David Levien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this.

I have both the VHS (older) and the DVD version (hey, it was on sale for 9 bucks!! lol) of The Man In The Iron Mask, and the DVD version (although not a whole lot of extras) has a nice directors commentary.

It really tells the director's vision for the film and all the behind the scene info.  I STILL can't believe that this movie was his FIRST film!!\n\nVery entertaining movie.  I really don't know why people dogged this movie so much.  It was SOOOO much better than that "OTHER" more RECENT musketeer movie that came out called "THE Musketeer".  UGghgh...what a dissapointment!\n\n But The Man In The Iron MASK is DEFINITELY a movie worth giving a try.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162496,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1998-03-13","keywords":"17th century,france,twin,musketeer,three musketeers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000460/","name":"Jeremy Irons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000518/","name":"John Malkovich"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103797/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0241416/","name":"Alexandre Dumas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":616031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"gun battle,armored car robbery,gunfight,organized crime,honor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heat: Director's Definitive Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi664516889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Splits"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035930/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"duration":"PT2H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":616031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"gun battle,armored car robbery,gunfight,organized crime,honor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heat: Director's Definitive Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi664516889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Splits","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035930/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"],"duration":"PT2H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie itself contains a riddle and that riddle is to be solved by us. Besides the engravings, lots of symbolism and hints will help us understand the meaning of several strange events and eventually the meaning of what the story is all about and what happened to Balkan and Corso. The plot is created around a joke, a joke that is based on a misunderstanding. This makes a movie that one needs to see more than once, I bought the DVD and saw it over twenty times. The story gets better every time you watch it, pay attention to even the smallest details like the color of the mysterious girl's socks, there is a good reason why Corso has a shoulder bag and an overcoat he never seems to part from, until the 'notorious' very last scene; shoulder bag and overcoat are gone... Aren't you curious about the meaning of broken glasses in combination of a mark between the eyes? Search the internet for the answers to the questions you have.

Adults will suffer....greatly!","reviewBody":"Yes, I hated this movie. But what can I say in my defense? It's a family film! Its core audience is the 5- 12 crowd, and let's face facts: kids will laugh at anything! That's exactly why I've never been a big fan of family films. I'm always bound to experience the predictable quotient of gags that involve vomit, farts and kicks in the groin - all of which are in this movie. Helen Keller can see the punchlines coming a mile away. Ice Cube seems thoroughly embarrassed to be a part of this movie. I'm sure he took on the project to hopefully broaden his demographic (never having done a PG film before). The kids, like most actors their age, constantly overact. Their nonstop bickering makes you feel Ice Cube's pain of having to escort them. Cube ends up getting into every implausible disaster you can possibly imagine. It would help if the gags had even a shred of credibility. Not to mention, every time something embarrassing and disastrous happens to Cube's character, the kids laugh like hyenas, making the gags mean-spirited as well as unfunny. The only moment I remember laughing is when the kids try to drive off in Cube's minivan. He chases after them and tries to climb inside through the sunroof. The kids crash into a giant statue of a lumberjack, holding an axe. The axe then falls down and nails Cube right in his groin. Another predictable gag, but after long periods of not laughing, I had to relieve myself in some fashion. And like in all these movies, there's a schmaltzy conclusion that's supposed to deliver a "message." When I left the theater, I saw this one mother who was so fed up with her bratty son that she picked him up and spanked him, yelling out obscenities. Obviously, this message of accepting kids for who they are, no matter how bratty they get, didn't sink through her head. So why do these films even bother? When you have a movie as detached from reality as "Are We There Yet?" it's hard to deliver a message to its audience that will linger with them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31076,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-05-25","keywords":"braces,fish out of water,child gagged,reference to lebron james,reference to 50 cent","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Are We There Yet?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991704857","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000505/","name":"Nia Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020248/","name":"Aleisha Allen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505152/","name":"Brian Levant"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044714/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027958/","name":"Steven Gary Banks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257282/","name":"Claudia Grazioso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

The moment I started it, it didn't make me bore for a moment. I got a sharp idea that it's a story about humans from the eyes of animals. Comes up, it's much more than that. It has real comedy, adventurous sit-com and is cunningly clever. The writing is FLAWLESS. The dialogues are better than amazing. It's one of the movies people watch again and again for the terrific dialogues towards the end. Steve Carrell is a legend! It deliver way more than my expectations. I honestly rate it 8.5/10. Yet another clever and funny animated movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167910,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-13","keywords":"food,raccoon,hedge,human,forest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Over the Hedge","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2163579673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc0MTdmYzMtODMyYi00MzE0LWE4OGQtNjg3ZmVmZjM3NzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc0MTdmYzMtODMyYi00MzE0LWE4OGQtNjg3ZmVmZjM3NzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Over The Hedge","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0788009/","name":"Garry Shandling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426333/","name":"Tim Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456732/","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089676/","name":"Len Blum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0131661/","name":"Lorne Cameron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395924/","name":"David Hoselton"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The chemistry between the actors was excellent and really added to the feel of the film. It takes a lot to get emotion out of me in a movie, I'm talking the beginning of Saving Private Ryan a lot, so I unfortunately didn't feel as much as some of the other people in the theater, but you know something is right when people cheer when the main characters kill bad guys and yell "NO!" when things don't go right. The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.\n\nSingleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I've ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.\n\nActing was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.\n\nWhile this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":141064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-16","keywords":"corrupt police,death of brother,death of mother,murder,funeral","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Four Brothers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135083801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0071275/","name":"André 3000"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005436/","name":"John Singleton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332238/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254213/","name":"David Elliot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1749087/","name":"Paul Lovett"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I really don't like the 2-story episodes of season 1. Season 2 is a lot better. Season 2 is all-around stronger, better, and scarier. There are plenty of jump scenes and loads of suspense. This is probably the best "Haunted Documentary" style show on TV.

What really tends to work well for this one is the fact that there's so much more fun cheesy action than expected here which provides this one with such a frantic pace that there's so much good times to come from this one. The first attack where they erupt on the beach is a great cheesy highlight with the formations appearing in the Florida skyline and the panic of the fleeing beach-crowds getting swarmed makes for a good time, the city-wide panic where they keep encountering the creatures in the apartment complex, at the car-depot and then the big scene with the creatures at the school while trying to re-check their supplies which introduces several big chases through the labs and classrooms trying to avoid them as their continued presence makes for a series of really enjoyable pieces that have a big impact on the film's overall pacing. That also manages to work for the rather shorter attacks throughout here that shows the spiders coming into play against the citizenry in fine form getting in the usual Sci-Fi Channel style fun and highly enjoyable encounters which manage to provide the big boost this needs to go into the finale which has the same overall fun and enjoyment with the big plan to finally take down the largest spider in the bunch which is where this one really gets quite enjoyable delivering plenty of thrilling action throughout here trying to execute their wacky plan to stop it that manages to top the exceptionally goofy and silly one from the original. That as well plays a big part of how much fun this one is as it still features the same overall attitude and tone as the first which helps to make the creatures that much more of a threat and gives the few silly lines that much more of an impact with the tone being quite consistent all the way through both. That said, there's still the one main flaw here that does tend to crop up in every single one of these films in that there's just absolutely nothing at all that realistic about the way the CGI looks in here, which is so obvious and fake that it really becomes distracting with the low-rent production getting this to look so out-of-sync with a real-life creature who fail to match their backgrounds all that accurately while managing to get the same overall grading and scene placement flaws that become prevalent and somewhat expected in these kinds of films. These, though, aren't detrimental at all and don't really tend to hold this one back too much.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Language.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-08-06","keywords":"fort,fortress,star,movie star,film star","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000430/","name":"Steve Guttenberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935498/","name":"Michael Winslow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5142128/","name":"Michele Weaver"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2415173/","name":"Nick Simon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140089/","name":"Neil Elman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4639862/","name":"Ashley O'Neil"}],"duration":"PT1H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The first attack where they erupt on the beach is a great cheesy highlight with the formations appearing in the Florida skyline and the panic of the fleeing beach-crowds getting swarmed makes for a good time, the city-wide panic where they keep encountering the creatures in the apartment complex, at the car-depot and then the big scene with the creatures at the school while trying to re-check their supplies which introduces several big chases through the labs and classrooms trying to avoid them as their continued presence makes for a series of really enjoyable pieces that have a big impact on the film's overall pacing. That also manages to work for the rather shorter attacks throughout here that shows the spiders coming into play against the citizenry in fine form getting in the usual Sci-Fi Channel style fun and highly enjoyable encounters which manage to provide the big boost this needs to go into the finale which has the same overall fun and enjoyment with the big plan to finally take down the largest spider in the bunch which is where this one really gets quite enjoyable delivering plenty of thrilling action throughout here trying to execute their wacky plan to stop it that manages to top the exceptionally goofy and silly one from the original. That as well plays a big part of how much fun this one is as it still features the same overall attitude and tone as the first which helps to make the creatures that much more of a threat and gives the few silly lines that much more of an impact with the tone being quite consistent all the way through both. That said, there's still the one main flaw here that does tend to crop up in every single one of these films in that there's just absolutely nothing at all that realistic about the way the CGI looks in here, which is so obvious and fake that it really becomes distracting with the low-rent production getting this to look so out-of-sync with a real-life creature who fail to match their backgrounds all that accurately while managing to get the same overall grading and scene placement flaws that become prevalent and somewhat expected in these kinds of films. These, though, aren't detrimental at all and don't really tend to hold this one back too much.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Language.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-08-06","keywords":"fort,fortress,star,movie star,film star","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000430/","name":"Steve Guttenberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935498/","name":"Michael Winslow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5142128/","name":"Michele Weaver"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2415173/","name":"Nick Simon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140089/","name":"Neil Elman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4639862/","name":"Ashley O'Neil"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What I really wanna know is how much it differs from the book. I also enjoyed paycheck &amp; although I, Robot was not one of his short stories it sure felt like one. This movie especially the first time I saw it had me hoping for one thing, then expecting another &amp; then just when I thought I had it figured out it all blew up in my face...(literally) OUTSTANDING! See it! Much like Riddick! this Movie &amp; story is just plain Great Sci-FI! Gary does an outstanding job convincing you that he is indeed not guilty, then you have trouble believing him as he starts to doubt himself, the whole time thinking maybe the government is just crazy, but slowly you put the pieces together &amp; just when you think you know who or what he/she is... Just see it, it is amazing SCI-FI! I am going to buy a copy right now.
