It was written and directed by Michal Rosa.\n\nThe movie is set in 1939 in an apartment house in Silesia--an area of Poland close to the German border. The apartment house itself is unusual. It's clearly not far from a city, but it sits in lonely isolation in a field. It's a very upscale place, and most of the people who live in it are middle or upper class. It's not what we in the U.S. would call a tenement, with poor people making ends meet. It's very elegant.\n\nThe plot centers around a journalist from a large city who is sent to the area to track down an elusive bestselling author. This search is more or less just a way to begin the story. When the reporter arrives, his first meeting is with the beautiful Róza, portrayed by Karolina Gruszka. \n\nRóza has many charms, which she openly displays to the reporter, as well as to any other man who joins her. In turn, director Rosa openly displays Gruszka's charms to his audience. We can all see why she's called "The Happiness of the World."\n\nThe movie plot is actually a series of vignettes. Each inhabitant of the apartment building has her or his own story. To a certain extent, the stories intersect, because all of the characters live in the same place. The pivotal figure in all of this is Róza. Karolina Gruszka isn't just another pretty face. She's an extraordinary actor, who is well known in Poland. The movie will rise or fall depending on Gruszka's presence on the screen. She's great, and the film rises accordingly.\n\nWe watched this movie in Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work well on the small screen. The film was shown at the outstanding 2017 Rochester Polish Film Festival. After the film, director Rosa was in attendance for a Q&amp;A session. (He doesn't speak English, but the interpreter who worked with him was superb.) My compliments to the PFF for bringing the director to Rochester.\n\nFor me, the most striking aspect of the Q&amp;A was Mr. Rosa's discussion of magical realism. I believe that everyone in the audience noted magical realism in the movie. Director Rosa says that it isn't magical realism--it's just realism. I'm not sure if he was joking with us when he said that, or whether he actually believes that the type of events he shows us aren't magical at all. You'll have to watch the movie to see what you think about this realism.\n\nP.S. The Happiness of the World has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.3. It's a much, much better movie than that. Again, you'll have to watch the movie and then decide for yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-12-23","keywords":"silesia,bathtub,femme fatale","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344734/","name":"Karolina Gruszka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8475166/","name":"Mateusz Lickindorf"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2707614/","name":"Grzegorz Palkowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577510/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both are low budget Costner films about a man dealing with a family loss which has a haunting outcome. It has been a while since I saw Dragonfly. Nobody thought it was any good, but it is way better than this film. To start with the obvious, The New Daughter represents what may be Costner's most lazy performance. It seems he has no interest in the story whatsoever. After a while the Dragonfly connection starts to fade away, and the movie turns into something else, something worse unfortunately. The New Daughter is torpid, and is bogged down by too much content, and not enough suspense or intelligent dialogue.\n\nIf I am gonna give the film any credit, it would be for photography. This is a gorgeously shot film, where the nights are cold, eerie and evocative, and the safety of home is warm, glowing and golden. The best shot in the film is the last one, which barely makes up for the utter stupidity of the ending. There is much left to explain, but in the end, I don't really care.\n\nThe New Daughter, is a spooky story, which is occasionally interesting but is less so than it is sloppily executed, badly acted, and not worth your money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14887,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-10-07","keywords":"mound,ant farm,indian burial ground,shotgun,father daughter relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The New Daughter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2034828313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDM1ODA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQwNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDM1ODA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQwNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A single father moves his two children to rural South Carolina, only to watch his daughter exhibit increasingly strange behavior.

Both are low budget Costner films about a man dealing with a family loss which has a haunting outcome. It has been a while since I saw Dragonfly. Nobody thought it was any good, but it is way better than this film. To start with the obvious, The New Daughter represents what may be Costner's most lazy performance. It seems he has no interest in the story whatsoever. After a while the Dragonfly connection starts to fade away, and the movie turns into something else, something worse unfortunately. The New Daughter is torpid, and is bogged down by too much content, and not enough suspense or intelligent dialogue.\n\nIf I am gonna give the film any credit, it would be for photography. This is a gorgeously shot film, where the nights are cold, eerie and evocative, and the safety of home is warm, glowing and golden. The best shot in the film is the last one, which barely makes up for the utter stupidity of the ending. There is much left to explain, but in the end, I don't really care.\n\nThe New Daughter, is a spooky story, which is occasionally interesting but is less so than it is sloppily executed, badly acted, and not worth your money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14887,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-10-07","keywords":"mound,ant farm,indian burial ground,shotgun,father daughter relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The New Daughter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2034828313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDM1ODA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQwNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDM1ODA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQwNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A single father moves his two children to rural South Carolina, only to watch his daughter exhibit increasingly strange behavior.

However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3740,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-22","keywords":"china,non linear,nonlinear timeline,hospital,loss of son","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1042071321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4592524/","name":"Jingchun Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3619308/","name":"Mei Yong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5035471/","name":"Xi Qi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0514744/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461717/","name":"Mei Ah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"duration":"PT3H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Superb Animation","reviewBody":"It's October and it is usually the time for Halloween themed movies. Unfortunately for us, Halloween has been reduced to cheap horrors, or repetitive thrillers that are a bit of a bore. This year has been slightly different, but this reviewer would like the studios to go back in the past and pull some more seasonal themes to entertain us. Well, someone got my vibe, because my last review is on a film that captures the festive fun that Halloween is for the young and young at heart. So sit back my friends and catch my latest review on the animated feature The Book of Life. \n\nI'll start this review with talking about the story. The Book of Life has a fantastic tale that centers on the typical complication of a love triangle between characters Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana), and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Now we know the typical elements involved in this type of plot, but this film deviates from the typical and gives a little more pep around the story. From the start you get the backstory on each character, and the individual struggles they each face. Then they take these qualities and exploit them by bringing in the two masters of the underworld, who make a wager as to who will win the girl. The result of this wager, makes for an interesting romantic tale that is fun, emotional, and more realistic than half the dramas we get these days. However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. \n\nThe story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. \n\nWhat else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered. Countless puns are shouted in ridiculous voices, often followed by a character face planting into an object. What's even better is that the comedy is also diverse and spread out instead of following the typical style of beating a joke to death, the exception being Joaquin's obsession with mustaches. In addition to the comedy, the music also brings some thing to the film. Most of the numbers are covers of famous songs, some done horribly to be funny and others that are very relevant to the plot. A couple of the original numbers made my emotions go on a ride, as happiness, sadness, and even love all came together in the instruments and voice. Now most won't find it as powerful as Frozen, but for this reviewer it was nice having the music around the movie, not the opposite way around. Aside from the singing, the voice acting is incredible, each of the cast capturing the essence of the stereotypical Mexican character. Now there are too many to write about so let me pick my three favorites. First is Christina Applegate, the girl has got sass, spunk, and compassion all at work in her tour guide character. The girls sells the story as she uses the wooden puppets, which are represented in the character design, to craft the tale, keeping the kids in line, and yet showing empathy. Then there was Zoe Saldana who has the feisty Mexican girl zest that shows everyone girls don't need men to save them. Her voice is suave and full of passion, and exactly the buffer needed amidst the rowdy, rough voices of the cast. Finally the Queen of the Dead was my favorite character, and Kate del Castillo does a nice job bringing the character to life with flare, kindness, and the ability to hold her own. \n\nWhat can you take away from my sporadic rambling? The Book of Life is one of the better animated films I've seen in a while. It's Halloween fun, with colorful worlds and characters that balance out the predictable and limited tale. I strongly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, possibly in 3-D. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in quite some time, and I believe most will enjoy the adventure at hand. My scores for this film are: \n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-10-15","keywords":"afterlife,mexico,death character,bullfight,serenade","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi840674329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0526019/","name":"Diego Luna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1509613/","name":"Jorge R.

Superb Animation","reviewBody":"It's October and it is usually the time for Halloween themed movies. Unfortunately for us, Halloween has been reduced to cheap horrors, or repetitive thrillers that are a bit of a bore. This year has been slightly different, but this reviewer would like the studios to go back in the past and pull some more seasonal themes to entertain us. Well, someone got my vibe, because my last review is on a film that captures the festive fun that Halloween is for the young and young at heart. So sit back my friends and catch my latest review on the animated feature The Book of Life. \n\nI'll start this review with talking about the story. The Book of Life has a fantastic tale that centers on the typical complication of a love triangle between characters Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana), and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Now we know the typical elements involved in this type of plot, but this film deviates from the typical and gives a little more pep around the story. From the start you get the backstory on each character, and the individual struggles they each face. Then they take these qualities and exploit them by bringing in the two masters of the underworld, who make a wager as to who will win the girl. The result of this wager, makes for an interesting romantic tale that is fun, emotional, and more realistic than half the dramas we get these days. However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. \n\nThe story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. \n\nWhat else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered. Countless puns are shouted in ridiculous voices, often followed by a character face planting into an object. What's even better is that the comedy is also diverse and spread out instead of following the typical style of beating a joke to death, the exception being Joaquin's obsession with mustaches. In addition to the comedy, the music also brings some thing to the film. Most of the numbers are covers of famous songs, some done horribly to be funny and others that are very relevant to the plot. A couple of the original numbers made my emotions go on a ride, as happiness, sadness, and even love all came together in the instruments and voice. Now most won't find it as powerful as Frozen, but for this reviewer it was nice having the music around the movie, not the opposite way around. Aside from the singing, the voice acting is incredible, each of the cast capturing the essence of the stereotypical Mexican character. Now there are too many to write about so let me pick my three favorites. First is Christina Applegate, the girl has got sass, spunk, and compassion all at work in her tour guide character. The girls sells the story as she uses the wooden puppets, which are represented in the character design, to craft the tale, keeping the kids in line, and yet showing empathy. Then there was Zoe Saldana who has the feisty Mexican girl zest that shows everyone girls don't need men to save them. Her voice is suave and full of passion, and exactly the buffer needed amidst the rowdy, rough voices of the cast. Finally the Queen of the Dead was my favorite character, and Kate del Castillo does a nice job bringing the character to life with flare, kindness, and the ability to hold her own. \n\nWhat can you take away from my sporadic rambling? The Book of Life is one of the better animated films I've seen in a while. It's Halloween fun, with colorful worlds and characters that balance out the predictable and limited tale. I strongly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, possibly in 3-D. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in quite some time, and I believe most will enjoy the adventure at hand. My scores for this film are: \n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-10-15","keywords":"afterlife,mexico,death character,bullfight,serenade","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi840674329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0526019/","name":"Diego Luna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1509613/","name":"Jorge R.

This here, Bone Eater won't be remembered. It contains a lot of very cheap and bad CGI but it's worth watching for the old thespians to see.\n\nI guess that the budget went to the casting in stead of the effects.

I have to say though that Richard Gere is outstanding in this movie. It started showing on ITV2 and his performance drew me into the story- I had to watch it to the end.\n\nIt's a brave premise for a Hollywood film but "Mr. Jones" is let down by a flawed script. I was offended by the way the doctor was portrayed. Of course she was played by a stunning actress, of course she became attached to her patient- to the point of invading his privacy by looking up his friends from his time at music college twenty years earlier. Oh, and of course (SPOILER- in more ways than one) she slept with him as well.

I have to say though that Richard Gere is outstanding in this movie. It started showing on ITV2 and his performance drew me into the story- I had to watch it to the end.\n\nIt's a brave premise for a Hollywood film but "Mr. Jones" is let down by a flawed script. I was offended by the way the doctor was portrayed. Of course she was played by a stunning actress, of course she became attached to her patient- to the point of invading his privacy by looking up his friends from his time at music college twenty years earlier. Oh, and of course (SPOILER- in more ways than one) she slept with him as well. She offers to resign which keeps her from being professionally ruined  sorry, but I can't see a qualified and experienced psychiatrist falling in love with her patient, let along sleeping with him while he's still under treatment.

    <title lang="xx">Shooting for Socrates</title>
    <title lang="pl">Strzał dla Sokratesa</title>
    <title lang="en">Shooting for Socrates</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Shooting for Socrates: Directed by James Erskine. With John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson. In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - "a fee for this and a fee for that") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - "the next George Best". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the "top of the World" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 3223394, Title: Shooting for Socrates, 
 --- Description: Shooting for Socrates: Directed by James Erskine. With John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson. In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - "a fee for this and a fee for that") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - "the next George Best". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the "top of the World" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all.

"Dracula 2000". Ick. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. To begin with, an interesting cast. Christopher Plummer has, previously, suffered from what I call "Michael Caine" syndrome; making any film that will write him a cheque, Johnny Lee Miller was amusing in "Trainspotting" and, let's not kid each other, there is no mystery as to why Jennifer Esposito and Jeri Ryan were cast. Round it out with some second and third tier young "Actors du jour" and you probably haven't spent too much money. \n\nNow...the most irritating aspect of the film is the almost surreal amount of flagrant Virgin Records placement. Seriously....Mary works in one of the stores which means we get prominent t-shirt coverage....not to mention the gawdy neon sign, the truck in the garage etc.....however, Dracula needs virgins, right?\n\nBy far the most interesting part of this film was the story behind the creation of Dracula. Taking the myth back to the time of the crucifixion, with Judas Iscariot suffering some fairly serious guilt issues leading to his suicide and eventual "re-birth"....good angle: it helped to explain the vampires aversion to all things holy and dislike of silver (as in 30 pieces of...). Still don't get the mirror-phobia but hey....\n\nSomeone on the creative team of this film has a sweet little visual gag in store. Check out the scene in the Laffayette Cemetery...there is a crypt bearing the name "Spencer Hepburn".

"Dracula 2000". Ick. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. To begin with, an interesting cast. Christopher Plummer has, previously, suffered from what I call "Michael Caine" syndrome; making any film that will write him a cheque, Johnny Lee Miller was amusing in "Trainspotting" and, let's not kid each other, there is no mystery as to why Jennifer Esposito and Jeri Ryan were cast. Round it out with some second and third tier young "Actors du jour" and you probably haven't spent too much money. \n\nNow...the most irritating aspect of the film is the almost surreal amount of flagrant Virgin Records placement. Seriously....Mary works in one of the stores which means we get prominent t-shirt coverage....not to mention the gawdy neon sign, the truck in the garage etc.....however, Dracula needs virgins, right?\n\nBy far the most interesting part of this film was the story behind the creation of Dracula. Taking the myth back to the time of the crucifixion, with Judas Iscariot suffering some fairly serious guilt issues leading to his suicide and eventual "re-birth"....good angle: it helped to explain the vampires aversion to all things holy and dislike of silver (as in 30 pieces of...). Still don't get the mirror-phobia but hey....\n\nSomeone on the creative team of this film has a sweet little visual gag in store. Check out the scene in the Laffayette Cemetery...there is a crypt bearing the name "Spencer Hepburn". Nice one.\n\nThe ending is a little rushed and it seems that Miller might have left the set early that day, since he apparently vanishes. It also leaves blatant amounts of room for a sequel, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nThat I even considered seeing this film was primarily due to Wes Craven's participation.

Nothing outstanding, but it was great to watch and I enjoyed it very much. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1989-10-13","keywords":"baby,birth,single mother,baby boy,new baby","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Look Who's Talking","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1168949017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY1ZjQ3NmItNjJjOC00MDgyLWEyZWMtOGI1M2I2MTJlYTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY1ZjQ3NmItNjJjOC00MDgyLWEyZWMtOGI1M2I2MTJlYTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000263/","name":"Kirstie Alley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001156/","name":"Olympia Dukakis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024112/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0692605/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must.\n\n"Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.

He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the "This is MY baby" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":324501,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"board game,adventurer,fight,game,year 1995","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jumanji","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677211417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Njc1MGUtNDYyYi00YTQxLTk0YTYtZjkzYWRhZTAyNWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Njc1MGUtNDYyYi00YTQxLTk0YTYtZjkzYWRhZTAyNWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002653/","name":"Joe Johnston"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852430/","name":"Greg Taylor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833164/","name":"Jim Strain"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The synopsis here is a "National Geographic" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest, and deadliest, snake.\n\nIt all begins in a boat on the Amazon River. There's a poacher (Danny Trejo) that's trying to call for help on a radio, but he cannot raise anyone. We see through the eyes of something that chases him up the radio tower on his boat. While up there, he kills himself with a hand gun.\n\nWe then shift to a documentary film crew that is going down the Amazon. They are looking for a Native American tribe that lives in the remote jungle. The director of the film crew is Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez). She has a past with a doctor of anthropology, Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz). It seems they've lost touch, but this trip might help to rekindle. He's an expert on tribes that live in the Amazon. Terri's camera man is Danny Rich (Ice Cube), her sound guy is Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) and the production manager is Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer). The man on camera and narrator is Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde). He is kind of rude, as he tells Denise to take his bags to his room, which she informs him that isn't her job.\n\nTheir barge is captained by Mateo (Vincent Castellanos). Early on we learn the different aspect of the characters. Hyde is uppity and has refined tastes, bringing expensive wine and golf clubs. Wilson and Wuhrer are seeing each other, with both of them acting somewhat childish about it.\n\nAs they begin their journey, they find a boat that is tangled some roots. The stranded man is Paul Serone (Jon Voight). He tells them that he is a snake catcher, which Terri calls him out for being a poacher. There is a moment where Serone and Mateo look at each other, which they seem to know who the other is, but nothing is shared. Serone just asks if they can take him to the next village so they can help him free his boat.\n\nIt actually turns out that they have might need to work together. Serone reveals that he knows the tribe of Native Americans they are looking for. He offers to help him. He doesn't reveal what he is actually trying to do though. The barge comes upon a snake totem and Serone suggests they take a path at a ford. Dr. Cale disagrees, stating that his logic is off and that way should be flooded. They take the other route.\n\nTheir barge gets stuck in some foliage and Dr. Cale goes into the water to free them. Before he can, he panics and begins to convulse. When he is brought back on the barge, his mouth is opened to reveal a wasp. It is large and poisonous. He can't breathe due to the stings, but Serone saves his life by giving him a tracheotomy with a knife and a pen casing. It is then decided that they have to go down the ford he said if they want to get to a hospital in time to save Dr. Cale.\n\nThe problem is that this other way is blocked by a wall. Serone has dynamite and wants to blow it up. Terri contends that the wall is there for a reason and that they do not know what. She is overruled to save Dr. Cale's life. We end up in the area where we saw the poacher in the beginning, but there's something else that is stalking them in the wild.\n\nAs I stated above, I've seen this film a handful of times. It definitely is a fun film, but it also has its flaws. I do really like the premise though. It isn't anything new as we've been seeing films with this idea for a long time. I like that a documentary film crew is going to the wilds to try to find this tribe. Even more than that, I do believe that we could get giant animals like this in isolated areas. It really is quite believable, especially with how difficult these places can be to reach. I like that there's no genetic engineering or anything man has done to influence them, this is just nature allowing it to do its thing.\n\nI really like the idea of Serone as well. He plays on the crew's gullibility. He's lived in these areas for awhile so he really knows things that they don't. When Dr. Cale is incapacitated, there is really no one to check him. He only reveals what you need to know as well. Going even farther, there is an interesting dynamic with Westbridge. He is very rude when he first comes aboard the boat. This is flipped when Serone takes over by commanding him around. I really dug that. There is also another interesting one as we see that stress ruins society. Gary sees what Serone is saying and joins in with his logic. If you know me, I'm nihilistic and it doesn't take much for society to break.\n\nI want to move now to the pacing of the film, which is where I think there are some issues. The film only has a runtime of 69 minutes. It does seem to drag a bit. While watching this, I was thinking and my assessment is that the build up to the film is too slow. We get a lot of action in the later part of the film, but I'm partially checked out by then so it doesn't have as much of an impact. It is interesting though, because I like the characters. I do think that it ends with a pretty solid flurry though.\n\nNext I want to cover the acting, which for the most part is actually pretty solid. Lopez is really good here. She is looking great and I like her character. She is looking out for her crew and doesn't care about the film they're supposed to me making when things take a turn. Cube is also really good. It interesting as he is a watered down version of characters we've seen him in the past, but it works for me. Voight is actually really good, which should surprise you. He makes a really good villain and I think part of that is he's naturally an asshole. The only issue I have is his horrible accent in the film. Stoltz, Hyde, Wilson and Wuhrer as well as the rest of the cast are solid and round out the film for what is needed. I do need to point out that Wuhrer is gorgeous.\n\nThis brings me to the effects of the film where they're hit or miss. I think the practical effects look good. The look of the snake is fine. It does look real and it moves that way as well. The only issue I have is that the head looks awkward at times as it seems closer to the characters, but the film just kind of ignores that. The real issue here is that pretty much all of the CGI doesn't hold up. I'm sure the first time I saw it; I was all in on it. With some time and reflection, it's not very good at all. The film is shot well which is something it has going for it.\n\nNow with that said, this film is definitely a fun creature feature. I think that it has a story that isn't new, but something that is still enjoyable. It does kind of look at society and I really like how Serone plays with this crew. There is a bit of a pacing issue, which doesn't make sense with how action packed the second half of the film is. I did somewhat check out if I'm honest. I do think that the acting is good for the most part, Voight's accent is bad. The effects of the film as I said are hit or miss, with the practical being mostly good and the CGI not so much. The soundtrack of the film is fine and does fit for what is needed. I would say don't come in expecting a great film. This is definitely a film that if you want to have some drinks with friends, it really works there. It is just slightly above average for me though.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://horrorreview.webnode.com/news/anaconda","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100890,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"1997-04-11","keywords":"anaconda,butt,snake,jungle,eaten by animal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Anaconda","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2713059609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyYzQ3MDQtZjM3NS00ODUyLTkwMjUtM2JlNjg4ZTZlOTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyYzQ3MDQtZjM3NS00ODUyLTkwMjUtM2JlNjg4ZTZlOTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000685/","name":"Jon Voight"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000182/","name":"Jennifer Lopez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000655/","name":"Eric Stoltz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515891/","name":"Luis Llosa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010507/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026438/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0061829/","name":"Hans Bauer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0143596/","name":"Jim Cash"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0258390/","name":"Jack Epps Jr."}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It had a completely new take on the superhero genre, it skillfully juggled both effective comedy and brutally violent action scenes, plus it had some pretty convincing characters and a dark storyline. The sequel, on the other hand, fails at the juggling part. The action scenes are still pretty brutal and effective, but the humour lacks that razor sharp edge that made the first one so believable despite its premise. Instead it relies on racial stereotypes and potty humour, which just isn't that funny.\n\nAdd in a lackluster storyline that honestly feels like watching tennis. First one character has a change of heart, then few minutes later he/she bounces back and another character decides to change his/her opinion, immediately after which the first one changes his/her stand. Rinse and repeat. A compelling and captivating story this does not make, especially when the villain generates mostly embarrassed facepalms and the final battle rejuvenates some of the first clichés the first film so artfully dodged.\n\nThat being said, the production values are still excellent, some of the new characters are pretty interesting (though there's way too many of them), I still like both Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and they had some really good scenes together. If you liked the first film and want to see the storyline continued, this one is worth checking out if you're not expecting miracles.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262717,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"superhero,high school,vigilante,kicked in the crotch,punched in the crotch","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Comic-Con Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1509927193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY1MjQ0MTYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc0Nzk4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY1MjQ0MTYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc0Nzk4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":" \tThe costumed high-school hero Kick-Ass joins with a group of normal citizens who have been inspired to fight crime in costume.

It had a completely new take on the superhero genre, it skillfully juggled both effective comedy and brutally violent action scenes, plus it had some pretty convincing characters and a dark storyline. The sequel, on the other hand, fails at the juggling part. The action scenes are still pretty brutal and effective, but the humour lacks that razor sharp edge that made the first one so believable despite its premise. Instead it relies on racial stereotypes and potty humour, which just isn't that funny.\n\nAdd in a lackluster storyline that honestly feels like watching tennis. First one character has a change of heart, then few minutes later he/she bounces back and another character decides to change his/her opinion, immediately after which the first one changes his/her stand. Rinse and repeat. A compelling and captivating story this does not make, especially when the villain generates mostly embarrassed facepalms and the final battle rejuvenates some of the first clichés the first film so artfully dodged.\n\nThat being said, the production values are still excellent, some of the new characters are pretty interesting (though there's way too many of them), I still like both Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and they had some really good scenes together. If you liked the first film and want to see the storyline continued, this one is worth checking out if you're not expecting miracles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262717,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"superhero,high school,vigilante,kicked in the crotch,punched in the crotch","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Comic-Con Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1509927193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY1MjQ0MTYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc0Nzk4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY1MjQ0MTYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc0Nzk4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":" \tThe costumed high-school hero Kick-Ass joins with a group of normal citizens who have been inspired to fight crime in costume.

No kidding, this is a sublime film, about family &amp; the importance of parenthood. This One's A Near-Perfect Comedy-Drama!\n\n'The Family Fang' Synopsis: A brother and sister return to their family home in search of their world famous parents who have disappeared.\n\n'The Family Fang' is a quietly devastating film, on how important it is to be a good parent, in order to raise their children sane. In here, the unsettled protagonists (Bateman, Nicole Kidman, in Pure Oscar Peak Form), are a victim of unusual parents (Christopher Walken &amp; Maryann Plunkett, both brilliant). They are not your regular parents, they are attention seekers, who find Art in the Reality of Life. They put up gigs (not even one of which shows any signs of entertainment, but of rather fright) &amp; they swear to live by it, in extreme measures. Its a devastating journey to see this family so distort, torn between love, commitment &amp; art.\n\nDavid Lindsay-Abaire's Adapted Screenplay is superior in all terms. 'The Family Fang' is essentially a comedy, with some dark, dramatic undertones. I was engrossed &amp; heartbroken by the struggle of its scarred protagonist. 'The Family Fang' is about artistry gone too far &amp; how a family is only a family, when you treat it like one. Bateman's Direction is Brilliant. He takes charge of the narrative &amp; doesn't let you go. Take a bow, Mr.Batemen!\n\nThe Fangs aren't particularly normal, but nor is their journey.

At times I found myself holding my breath, and couldn't figure out why. The movie had a good flow to it, with enough exciting parts to keep you from falling asleep.

The movie was almost always exciting, but showed more of the emotional side of the characters.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this one. At times I found myself holding my breath, and couldn't figure out why. The movie had a good flow to it, with enough exciting parts to keep you from falling asleep. My biggest complaint with the movie is it didn't go as deep into the emotional sides of things and felt like it wanted to be more of a mainstream movie because of it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49604,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,nude swimming,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

    <desc lang="pl">Kochankowie roku tygrysa: Directed by Jacek Bromski. With Michal Zebrowski, Li Min, Sun Ji Feng, Wu Fen Xia. The year is 1913. Two Poles escape exile and cross the Siberian taiga to China. Crossing the Amur River ends tragically for one of them.

His battle with Diffuse Lewy body disease which is incurable, how it impacted him. The story is narrated by his wife Susan Schneider, close friends, and neuroscientist. The saddest part is, Robin never knew his enemy, what is he suffering from. Neither his doctors had any idea until 2016 by then it was two years since robin left the world.\n\n Review: Robin Williams is widely creative, undoubtedly the greatest improvisational actor can fit into any role, no one can keep up with his humour, more than all he has been generous, a loving human always spreads happiness unconditionally. This film recalls the life and legacy of Robin from friends, neighbors, colleagues, and his wife, Susan Schneider. As we all know by now, Robin didn't commit suicide because he is depressed or addiction problems. He was suffering from rare Lewy body dementia (LBD). LBD Is a case of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.\n\n The movie primarily focuses on the final days of the robin, his struggles, and more importantly, his strength. Despite fighting a war inside his brain with an unknown enemy, he still kept a smile on his face. He made the world a better place with his morals, generosity, humour. The movie also features some scenes of Robin Williams from documentaries and talk shows. Where we see highlights his major roles and how he brings laughter to people around them and his philosophies of life. This documentary also raises awareness about LBD. The symptoms and risks are talked by neuroscientists.\n\n Verdict: As a fan of Robin Williams, this movie is nostalgic and also heartbreaking. Robins Wish (2020) Pays Tribute to the beloved actor Robin Williams, a full of life human being. Oh, captain my captain, you will forever be remembered.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1485,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"genre":["Documentary","Biography"],"datePublished":"2020-09-01","keywords":"suicide,death,comedian,robin williams,archive footage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin's Wish","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1018347801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiNDE4OTktYTkzMi00NjhmLWFlZjktMDE0YjYyNzk4ZDZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiNDE4OTktYTkzMi00NjhmLWFlZjktMDE0YjYyNzk4ZDZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6699367/","name":"Susan Schneider"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5985170/","name":"John R.

LBD Is a case of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.\n\n The movie primarily focuses on the final days of the robin, his struggles, and more importantly, his strength. Despite fighting a war inside his brain with an unknown enemy, he still kept a smile on his face. He made the world a better place with his morals, generosity, humour. The movie also features some scenes of Robin Williams from documentaries and talk shows. Where we see highlights his major roles and how he brings laughter to people around them and his philosophies of life. This documentary also raises awareness about LBD. The symptoms and risks are talked by neuroscientists.\n\n Verdict: As a fan of Robin Williams, this movie is nostalgic and also heartbreaking. Robins Wish (2020) Pays Tribute to the beloved actor Robin Williams, a full of life human being. Oh, captain my captain, you will forever be remembered.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1485,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Documentary","Biography"],"datePublished":"2020-09-01","keywords":"suicide,death,comedian,robin williams,archive footage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin's Wish","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1018347801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiNDE4OTktYTkzMi00NjhmLWFlZjktMDE0YjYyNzk4ZDZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiNDE4OTktYTkzMi00NjhmLWFlZjktMDE0YjYyNzk4ZDZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6699367/","name":"Susan Schneider","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5985170/","name":"John R.

Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.\n\nWe Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

    <desc lang="pl">Brytyjka Diana Spencer żyła w latach 1961-1997. W 1981 roku poślubiła księcia Walii, Karola i tym samym weszła do królewskiej rodziny. W jej życiorysie znajdują się takie wydarzenia jak skandaliczny rozwód czy tragiczna śmierć. Twórcy dokumentu przybliżają sylwetkę kobiety, która stała się księżną Dianą. Przyglądają się także rodzinie, z której się wywodziła. Okazuje się, że losy tej familii również są niezwykle ciekawe.</desc>

Lets just say they set up certain things in the movie and then never use them. You're like, oh the beginning of the movie said this, but don't expect anything to happen because... bad writing.\n\nIt really peaks near the beginning, then really drags on. Theres a fight scene near the end that is endless, unbelievable, really repetitive. The climax is anticlimactic so....\n\nThere was potential for a good movie, and the actors did fine, but the characters didn't act like real people. It was so obvious what was going on but they dragged on every single story element and repeated it. I feel bad for these actors; Truly a waste of money and talent.\n\nPart of the reason it was so bad is because it has an intellectual level of Spy Kids, super predictable and stereotypical moments but placed and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth. It checks all the boxes except being interesting and having a good plot... you know... like missing the whole point of movies.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67203,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-08-28","keywords":"mutant,based on comic book,marvel comics,x men,superheroine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Comic-Con Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1041219097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIyNDQxZDgtNTY0NS00ZDcxLTkwNDgtYjQ1ZGI0NGU2ODcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIyNDQxZDgtNTY0NS00ZDcxLTkwNDgtYjQ1ZGI0NGU2ODcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Twentieth Century Studios in association with Marvel Entertainment presents The New Mutants, an original horror thriller set in an isolated hospital where a group of young mutants is being held for psychiatric monitoring.

Lets just say they set up certain things in the movie and then never use them. You're like, oh the beginning of the movie said this, but don't expect anything to happen because... bad writing.\n\nIt really peaks near the beginning, then really drags on. Theres a fight scene near the end that is endless, unbelievable, really repetitive. The climax is anticlimactic so....\n\nThere was potential for a good movie, and the actors did fine, but the characters didn't act like real people. It was so obvious what was going on but they dragged on every single story element and repeated it. I feel bad for these actors; Truly a waste of money and talent.\n\nPart of the reason it was so bad is because it has an intellectual level of Spy Kids, super predictable and stereotypical moments but placed and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth. It checks all the boxes except being interesting and having a good plot... you know... like missing the whole point of movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67203,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-08-28","keywords":"mutant,based on comic book,marvel comics,x men,superheroine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Comic-Con Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1041219097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIyNDQxZDgtNTY0NS00ZDcxLTkwNDgtYjQ1ZGI0NGU2ODcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIyNDQxZDgtNTY0NS00ZDcxLTkwNDgtYjQ1ZGI0NGU2ODcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Twentieth Century Studios in association with Marvel Entertainment presents The New Mutants, an original horror thriller set in an isolated hospital where a group of young mutants is being held for psychiatric monitoring.

This one is supposed to be a war comedy about stealing gold from Nazi's.\n\nIt was supposed to be comedy . Unfortunately the movie takes itself way too seriously . The movie unnecessary tries to tell something about anti-Semitism , betrayal and courage of freedom fighters. For more than half of the movie is hard to tell that this is comedy . When the so-called jokes appear in the second half of the movie they so awful you will groan. The movie also feels too long (it's 2 hours long ) , which wasn't a problem in the first movie (which was almost 3 hours long) . Gone is the charm and the fun of original.\n\nThe acting is good and the music is very jolly . Still , it's too little to save the movie from being a disaster. I give it 1/10. Better watch "Kelly's heroes".

The heroes from the first movie also appear here , but there is plenty of new heroes . The first movie was a war comedy about a group of friends running away from army . This one is supposed to be a war comedy about stealing gold from Nazi's.\n\nIt was supposed to be comedy . Unfortunately the movie takes itself way too seriously . The movie unnecessary tries to tell something about anti-Semitism , betrayal and courage of freedom fighters. For more than half of the movie is hard to tell that this is comedy . When the so-called jokes appear in the second half of the movie they so awful you will groan. The movie also feels too long (it's 2 hours long ) , which wasn't a problem in the first movie (which was almost 3 hours long) . Gone is the charm and the fun of original.\n\nThe acting is good and the music is very jolly . Still , it's too little to save the movie from being a disaster. I give it 1/10. Better watch "Kelly's heroes". Or the original – "HK Deserters".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"genre":["Action","Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"1998-12-04","keywords":"1940s,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464945/","name":"Marek Kondrat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0511277/","name":"Boguslaw Linda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953975/","name":"Wiktor Zborowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538105/","name":"Janusz Majewski"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538105/","name":"Janusz Majewski"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Many of us vividly recall the days when the most important thing you had to do that afternoon was find a place to stay cool or to make sure that all of your friends were willing to go on whatever adventure you wanted to embark on.  For me, those days were the years between 1980 and 1987.  At this time I was between the ages of 8 and 15.  This was a time when some of the greatest movies were ever made for a teenaged boy.  The genesis of film was started in my life with films like First Blood, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Back To The Future and of course E.T.\n\n Being that movies were such an intricate part of my young life and these experiences shaped me into the man that I am today, it is easy to recall with reverence the entire experience that went with those films.  E.T. is a rare film however, because it is an experience that just gets better with age.\n\nThere was a theater in Windsor Ontario, where I spent my youth called the Vanity, located on Oullette Street, right near Wyandotte.  This one theater was the place to be when the blockbsuters arrived.  It was a one celled theater that managed to flourish in a time which pre-dated multi plexes with arcades and Pizza Hut's.\n\nWhen the sequel to Star Wars arrived, the Vanity proudly played it.  Same with Raiders and it's sequels and of course E.T.  E.T. was a film that me and my best friend Gary had to see because it was Spielberg.  Even though we were ten years old, we knew that Spielberg had given us great films like Jaws, Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not sure if it is normal at the age of ten but we rushed out to see E.T. because we knew who directed it.  What a phenom this tiny film turned out to be and what a life changing experience the whole film was.\n\nWhen you are ten and you see a movie with your best friend who watches the A-Team and Conan the Barbarian with you, you expect a certain reaction from him.  After all, this same friend enjoys playing football at lunch and enjoys inflicting pain in a barbaric pasttime called the "The Tripping Game", therefore you don't expect a film to affect you and your macho friend the way E.T. did.  When you are ten, you go to the movies to see things like lightsabre duels and heroes with bullwhips being lowered into the Well of the Souls and maybe the occasional breast shot.  What you don't expect is a film to manipulate your emotional realm thh way E.T. did and still does. Most of my friends who saw E.T. bawled their eyes out at the age of ten. I, for some unexplainable reason did not.  I loved the film but it wouldn't be for another six years that I cried in my first film.  That was She's Having A Baby when Kate Bush sang Woman's Work and made me sob uncontrollably as I watched Kevin Bacon lose his unborn child.  Some things can't be explained.\n\nE.T. became one of my favourite films and I saw it again on its re-release in 1985, bought the poster, purchased the movie on VHS and told everyone who would listen that E.T. got robbed at the 82 Oscars when it lost every major category to (snicker snicker) Gandhi.  There have been some Oscar travesties but this ( along with Annie Hall defeating Star Wars and Cuckoo's Nest beating Jaws ) had to be up there as one of the most ridiculous snubs ever. I was peeved.  What a joke.  But all of the cranky and derelict academy members seethed with contempt and jealousy because they couldn't accept the fact that a man this young could really be this much of a genius.  In fact he made the rest of the folks in Hollywood look young compared to himself.\n\nAs the years passed I became a film lover, a movie buff and I tried to see any and every film out there.  And I did.  It's not that E.T. became an after-thought, it's just that it became one of those films that just sat it my collection and wasn't utilized often enough.  When I made my revised top 25 list, E.T. would always hover around number 20.  That is not an indictment of the quality of E.T., it's just that my tastes became more garnered to horror films and the sheer brilliance of E.T. was stored in the catacombs of my mind.  That all changed on March 24th, 2002.  This is ironic because my wife and I had the whole day planned.  We were going to see E.T. at the theater and then come home and watch the 24 hour Oscar-a-thon.  And in a year when an inferior film like A Beautiful Mind takes top honours from the much more ambitious and deserving Lord of the Rings, it reminded me of 20 years ago.  I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nSeeing E.T. after a 17 year hiatus was nothing short of uplifting.  My excitement was gushing and when John Williams' ever recognizable score reverberated over the sound system, I was hooked and it felt like I was ten all over again.  I also noticed that the audience was an eclectic mix of young kids, 30 somethings like myself and the elderly.  All of us were there because we either wanted to experience it for the first time or because we wanted to feel what it was like that first time we saw it 20 years ago.\n\nI think I liked E.T. when I was ten but this time around I developed a deep level of respect for it.  E.T. is simply one of the finest films ever made and if you have not seen the film in the theater then you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything about this film is perfect, and there really aren't many films around I can say that about.  Even some of my personal favourites have moments of weakness but not E.T.  There has never really been another movie that has offered the experience that E.T. does.  And when I said that I didn't shed a tear while watching E.T., that has all changed. I think there were about five moments in E.T. that had me holding back the tears.  You can analyze the film, psychologically deconstruct it and tell me that the reason the film works so well is because of the feeling of loneliness and comradery and I will agree with you.  But I don't really care about that.  What it comes down to is that E.T. is a film that will touch you in a way that no other film before could do and no other film after it can.  1982 was a different time for film and it was a different time as a civilization.  And E.T. encompassed all of that.  If I had to make my revised top 25 list, E.T. would be number 2, right behind Jaws and ahead of JFK, Halloween, American Beauty and Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nIf you have not seen E.T. at the theaters since 1985, please I urge you, go see it again.  It is a film experience that is indefeasible.  It is also a film that should be looked upon as a paradigm for which all movies should try to emulate.  There is a reason that films like E.T. and Star Wars and Raiders make the money they do.  And there is also a reason they stay firmly planted in our memories.  That is because they mean something and they stand for something.  Those are the qualities in film that transcend time and they transcend the generations.\n\n10 out of 10----What more can be said?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":388895,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1983-04-25","keywords":"friendly alien,extraterrestrial,empathy,alien,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial: Anniversay Edition [Blu-Ray + Digital Copy]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3090130201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001794/","name":"Henry Thomas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000106/","name":"Drew Barrymore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001075/","name":"Peter Coyote"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558953/","name":"Melissa Mathison"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Theres a fight scene near the end that is endless, unbelievable, really repetitive. The climax is anticlimactic so....\n\nThere was potential for a good movie, and the actors did fine, but the characters didn't act like real people. It was so obvious what was going on but they dragged on every single story element and repeated it. I feel bad for these actors; Truly a waste of money and talent.\n\nPart of the reason it was so bad is because it has an intellectual level of Spy Kids, super predictable and stereotypical moments but placed and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth.

Lets just say they set up certain things in the movie and then never use them. You're like, oh the beginning of the movie said this, but don't expect anything to happen because... bad writing.\n\nIt really peaks near the beginning, then really drags on. Theres a fight scene near the end that is endless, unbelievable, really repetitive. The climax is anticlimactic so....\n\nThere was potential for a good movie, and the actors did fine, but the characters didn't act like real people. It was so obvious what was going on but they dragged on every single story element and repeated it. I feel bad for these actors; Truly a waste of money and talent.\n\nPart of the reason it was so bad is because it has an intellectual level of Spy Kids, super predictable and stereotypical moments but placed and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth.

Only near the end of the film do we discover why.\n\nThe film brilliantly deals with multiple layers and flashbacks, with perfect pacing and quite outstanding acting. The musical score is phenomenal.\n\nThis is a film about tragedy and loss, about how trauma lives on. It perfectly weaves the themes of ethnicity and religion.\n\nIt's a superb, haunting, film which I have not done justice here. In part that's because I don't want to do a review with spoilers.

It tells the story of two boys who grow up together. They are brothers through circumstances: the violinist child prodigy from the Warsaw Jewish community and the London lad who eventually befriends him when they are brought together. The story revolves around the sudden disappearance, on the day of his virtuoso concert, of the prodigy. Only near the end of the film do we discover why.\n\nThe film brilliantly deals with multiple layers and flashbacks, with perfect pacing and quite outstanding acting. The musical score is phenomenal.\n\nThis is a film about tragedy and loss, about how trauma lives on. It perfectly weaves the themes of ethnicity and religion.\n\nIt's a superb, haunting, film which I have not done justice here. In part that's because I don't want to do a review with spoilers. You have to go and see this film and allow your soul to be transported by the wonderful cinematography, script and musical score.\n\nThey don't make films as beautiful and brilliant as this very often.

But a few years later, Lorna marries bad-un Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain) and disappears back to Donnie's hillbilly extended family in the wilds of North Dakota, led by the fearsome Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville). Fearing for the child's wellbeing, Margaret drags retired Sheriff George on a dangerous journey to rescue the child.\n\nThere are strong similarities in this story with a sub-plot of the excellent "Ozark", where the psychopathic Darlene Snell (Lisa Emery) is intent on having a child to grow up with on her remote ranch. The sense of tension there is recreated here, exacerbated by the movie's extremely slow (read "glacial") pace in its early stages. It's the same sort of rising dread that I felt with "Nocturnal Animals". This reaches its peak at a tense standoff over lamb chops at the Weboy ranch, but we are probably half-way into the film by then.\n\nThe slow pace however is broken by a couple of extremely violent scenes that earn the movie its UK-15 certificate. One (no spoilers here!) harks back to another Kevin Costner blockbuster where he was a bit luckier! And the finale turns a slightly sleepy tale of "two old folks" into an 'all guns blazing' action western that's highly unexpected. Although you could argue that this is tonally extremely uneven, it works and makes the movie a lot more memorable than it otherwise would be.\n\nThe standout leading performance here is the one from Diane Lane as the mentally tortured Granny pursuing her convictions across the country. Here writer/director Thomas Bezucha gives the character full rein. It's a memorable 'strong female' part, that would have been dominated by the male lead in the writing of films a few years back. Lane delivers a dramatic and rock-solid performance that has Oscar nomination written all over it.\n\nI'm also a big fan of Kevin Costner, not just because he's a solid and reliable actor over many years. I always remember him gamely appearing as "The Postman"/'propeller-guy' in Billy Crystal's hilarious montage opening for the 70th Academy Awards. Anyhow, here he has his meatiest dramatic role in many years, and delivers fully on it. Top job, although I suspect this may not be his year for his elusive Best Actor award.\n\nFinally, rounding out the Oscar hopefuls is the brilliant Lesley Manville as Blanche Weboy. It's a dream of a role for the Brighton-born star, nominated of course for the Best Supporting Actress two years ago for "Phantom Thread". And she is genuinely chilling here, firing on all cylinders like some sort of deranged Bette Davis on speed. She's used sparingly in the movie, but that makes her scenes all the more memorable. Another nomination perhaps? I'd predict so, yes.\n\nI found this to be an uncomfortable watch, since I found myself in a moral quandary with the storyline. It's clear that Margaret is genuinely concerned for the safety of Jimmy (and less so, Lorna). Yet, what she is ultimately prepared to do is consider child abduction, when the law if probably on the side of the other party. Sure, the lifestyle and attitudes of the Weboys are alien to this more traditional "Granny". But although Blanche rules with a Victorian-level of grit, isn't she - at least before any of her more vicious tendencies emerge - entitled to do that? The film firmly roots itself behind the Blackledge's as "the good guys", but the script cleverly has you questioning that at various points,\n\nTwo technical categories in "Let Him Go" are also worthy of note. The cinematography is by Guy Godfree, and the sweeping vistas of Montana and North Dakota (actually Alberta in Canada!) are gloriously delivered. And the music by Michael Giacchino - one of my favourite composers - is cello-heavy and fitting for the sombre storyline. I always assess the quality of a score by whether I annoy the cinema cleaners by sitting until the last of the end credits have rolled, and this is one I did that to.\n\nAs the last movie I see before Christmas, "Let Him Go" is not exactly a feelgood festive offering. It's a well-crafted and thoughtful story, but not one to make you feel good inside, for the reasons outlined above. If you are a movie-lover though, then it's an interesting watch, if only for the fine acting performances on offer.\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out "Bob the Movie Man" on the web.

I always remember him gamely appearing as "The Postman"/'propeller-guy' in Billy Crystal's hilarious montage opening for the 70th Academy Awards. Anyhow, here he has his meatiest dramatic role in many years, and delivers fully on it. Top job, although I suspect this may not be his year for his elusive Best Actor award.\n\nFinally, rounding out the Oscar hopefuls is the brilliant Lesley Manville as Blanche Weboy. It's a dream of a role for the Brighton-born star, nominated of course for the Best Supporting Actress two years ago for "Phantom Thread". And she is genuinely chilling here, firing on all cylinders like some sort of deranged Bette Davis on speed. She's used sparingly in the movie, but that makes her scenes all the more memorable. Another nomination perhaps? I'd predict so, yes.\n\nI found this to be an uncomfortable watch, since I found myself in a moral quandary with the storyline. It's clear that Margaret is genuinely concerned for the safety of Jimmy (and less so, Lorna). Yet, what she is ultimately prepared to do is consider child abduction, when the law if probably on the side of the other party. Sure, the lifestyle and attitudes of the Weboys are alien to this more traditional "Granny". But although Blanche rules with a Victorian-level of grit, isn't she - at least before any of her more vicious tendencies emerge - entitled to do that? The film firmly roots itself behind the Blackledge's as "the good guys", but the script cleverly has you questioning that at various points,\n\nTwo technical categories in "Let Him Go" are also worthy of note. The cinematography is by Guy Godfree, and the sweeping vistas of Montana and North Dakota (actually Alberta in Canada!) are gloriously delivered. And the music by Michael Giacchino - one of my favourite composers - is cello-heavy and fitting for the sombre storyline. I always assess the quality of a score by whether I annoy the cinema cleaners by sitting until the last of the end credits have rolled, and this is one I did that to.\n\nAs the last movie I see before Christmas, "Let Him Go" is not exactly a feelgood festive offering. It's a well-crafted and thoughtful story, but not one to make you feel good inside, for the reasons outlined above. If you are a movie-lover though, then it's an interesting watch, if only for the fine acting performances on offer.\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out "Bob the Movie Man" on the web. Thanks.)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21358,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-11-06","keywords":"based on novel,husband wife relationship,grief,final battle,final showdown","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi876658201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBmMGExZjQtYTFmMy00NTc1LThhNWEtZWRmMzI4ZTk4ZGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBmMGExZjQtYTFmMy00NTc1LThhNWEtZWRmMzI4ZTk4ZGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Following the loss of their son, retired sheriff George Blackledge (Costner) and his wife Margaret (Lane) leave their Montana ranch to rescue their young grandson from the clutches of a dangerous family living off the grid in the Dakotas, headed by matriarch Blanche Weboy.

Certainly a bittersweet reflection on the passing of time and the risk of forgetting who we are, the story well written, funny and at times even moving, The film features three unexpectedly excellent first ladies, perfectly at ease in their meeting with Aldo Giovanni and Giacomo as well as the return of their historic director, who still knows how to make the most of their potential.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2261,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-01-30","keywords":"friend","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3128737305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA5Y2E2MWUtMTdkYS00NjI3LTg0NzQtNTZmZmQwMjA0MDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA5Y2E2MWUtMTdkYS00NjI3LTg0NzQtNTZmZmQwMjA0MDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017623/","name":"Aldo Baglio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320495/","name":"Giovanni Storti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316034/","name":"Giacomo Poretti"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893111/","name":"Massimo Venier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043281/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117688/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0254125/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3291357/","name":"Davide Lantieri"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1614496/","name":"Michele Pellegrini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893111/","name":"Massimo Venier"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Certainly a bittersweet reflection on the passing of time and the risk of forgetting who we are, the story well written, funny and at times even moving, The film features three unexpectedly excellent first ladies, perfectly at ease in their meeting with Aldo Giovanni and Giacomo as well as the return of their historic director, who still knows how to make the most of their potential.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2261,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-01-30","keywords":"friend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3128737305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA5Y2E2MWUtMTdkYS00NjI3LTg0NzQtNTZmZmQwMjA0MDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA5Y2E2MWUtMTdkYS00NjI3LTg0NzQtNTZmZmQwMjA0MDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017623/","name":"Aldo Baglio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320495/","name":"Giovanni Storti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316034/","name":"Giacomo Poretti"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893111/","name":"Massimo Venier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0254125/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3291357/","name":"Davide Lantieri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1614496/","name":"Michele Pellegrini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893111/","name":"Massimo Venier"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I have not read the novel (even though I plan to do it now) so I'm only offering my views on the movie.\n\nFirst of all: It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. \n\nRobert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me, since I didn't really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or "Remember Me". He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in, and even though I love Emile Hirsch (who auditioned for Jacob too) I'm confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role, it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.\n\nReese Witherspoon was okay.

I may be a bit biased since I loved him in "Inglorious Basterds", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars.

Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn't like (particularly towards the end of it), but overall it was a magical, spectacular and epic period movie, and I can't wait to see it again!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113964,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-04-22","keywords":"animal abuse,circus,elephant,ringmaster,train","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2: Water for Elephants","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1397594649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzA4MjYxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc1NTYzNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzA4MjYxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc1NTYzNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A veterinary student (Robert Pattinson) abandons his studies after his parents are killed and joins a traveling circus as their vet, where he meets animal trainer August (Christoph Waltz) and his wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon).","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910607/","name":"Christoph Waltz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1349376/","name":"Francis Lawrence"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177280/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481418/","name":"Richard LaGravenese","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2717485/","name":"Sara Gruen"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So, she and her caregiver Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) flees to a South Carolina town where it holds the secret of her mother's past.

Lily and Rosaleen finds the intelligent Boatwright sisters: August (Queen Latifah), June (Alicia Keys and May (Sophie Okenendo) where they take Lily and Rosaleen in, to have a place to stay for a while.\n\nThe Secret Life Of Bees is a movie of what you call a "tearjerker" and that's what it is, the movie will touch your heart and teaches you about life, care, love &amp; forget about your horrible past and move on. As for performances, everyone delivers and a couple of Oscar-worthy ones too. Dakota Fanning and Sophie Okenendo are the ones that delivers the Oscar-worthy performances. Come Oscars season, don't be surprised if any of those both actresses will be in the envelope (they deserved to get those nods!!) Queen Latifah, Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson (R.I.P her brother and mother who just passed away one day ago.) delivered their best performances yet even Jennifer (I thought this was her best performance yet and better than ever Oscar-winning performance in Dreamgirls.). As for the supporting actors: Bettany, Parker and Wilds, they did great as well.\n\nThe Secret Life Of Bees is one of this year's best films, rush out and buy a ticket for this wonderful and amazing film!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25584,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His battle with Diffuse Lewy body disease which is incurable, how it impacted him. The story is narrated by his wife Susan Schneider, close friends, and neuroscientist. The saddest part is, Robin never knew his enemy, what is he suffering from. Neither his doctors had any idea until 2016 by then it was two years since robin left the world.\n\n Review: Robin Williams is widely creative, undoubtedly the greatest improvisational actor can fit into any role, no one can keep up with his humour, more than all he has been generous, a loving human always spreads happiness unconditionally.

Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.\n\nWe Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

Complete with a typically Scandinavian atmosphere of understated emotion, this film isn't the hyperbolic drama it could have been in different hands, instead telling its story as quietly, yet honestly, as possible.\n\nDirector Grímur Hákonarson received strong acclaim around the world for his 2015 film, Rams, which also looks at life in Iceland's farming community. That film, though insightful and certainly atmospheric, wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling in my opinion, and often felt more drab than genuinely understated.\n\nThe County, however, is a step in the right direction. Certainly, the film is deliberately filled with rough edges. It moves at a slow pace, its setting is rugged, and it often gets very detailed with the nitty-gritty of the politics of farming - something that few other films are willing to do.\n\nAnd yet, this is never a boring watch. It's not a heart-stopping one either, but The County is meant to be an understated and affecting drama, and it achieves that for the most part.\n\nAbove all, the film's political edge is its most interesting line of focus. Though not entirely present in the early stages of the film, which looks more at grief and vulnerability, The County really steps up a gear in its middle act, taking aim at abusive and controlling organisations that pretend to be benevolent members of the community.\n\nAs I said, the nitty-gritty of how Icelandic farming cooperatives work may not be something you'd immediately think of as fascinating, but The County imbues that with real emotional depth, pitching the conflict between a frustrated farmer and an increasingly arrogant and uncontrollable organisation against the backdrop of personal loss.\n\nIn that, the film's overall arc comes together nicely, with a captivating blend of emotional and political drama. However, The County is just missing a small spark of life to really make it hit home.\n\nHákonarson's understated style shouldn't be criticised, after all it's what makes some of this film's most intimate and thought-provoking moments so powerful. However, this story, which to a degree looks at pent-up frustration, doesn't quite deliver that emotion as effectively as could be the case.\n\nThere's a part of me that wants this film to be a little like Wild Tales - a story of a normal person eventually having enough with the world and losing their cool. However, this is Iceland, not Argentina, and they deal with their frustration in a different way.\n\nSo, The County doesn't go to the hyperbolic lengths of Wild Tales, but in retaining such an understated style, it misses the opportunity to really get you on side with its main character, and sympathise with her enormous frustration and anger.\n\nArndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir gives an excellent performance throughout, it's just that the screenplay doesn't lend enough attention to her feelings of anger, instead putting more focus on the political connotations of the story. That's interesting in its own way, but I feel that a stronger display of anger in the screenplay could have been the difference between The County being a good film and a great film.\n\nStill, The County is undeniably a good film. Better than Rams with its blend of emotional and political drama, as well as a hint of exciting drama on the verge of exploding, it's a captivating watch throughout, albeit missing that extra spark of frustration and anger that could have made it even better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1096,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's a very awkward logic to this to the story that introduces ideas without developing them, underusing a potentially great ensemble with little room for characters to develop without the satisfying resolution that it should have had. However, in saying that, it's a non-intensive watch requiring little effort to process as viewers are thrown pieces of a puzzle that doesn't fully get put together by the ending credits. Community's, Joel McHale plays a cartoon-like character of the perfect husband, Tom. Somehow the chemistry he manages to kind with co-star Kerry Bishe, who plays wife Janet brings a cynical sense of realism as they're surrounded by resentful friends who find it impossible to fathom their deliriously happy and fertile marriage after fourteen years. Seems simple enough, until we get pulled into a vortex out of Netflix's, Black Mirror where anything goes really. Supporting ensemble standout, Natalie Morales, we know from, Netflix's 'Dead to Me', 'Santa Clarita Diet', so there's no disappointment in her performance given what she had to play with. It's difficult to understand what the point of the story was here as it leads with the idea that marriage is destined to become a state of complacency and misery, before introducing an unexplained architect and puppet master that imprisons Tom and Janet in a luxury mansion for a circle of trust therapy session. Did we lose you? Yeh, there's alot of that in this. Unexplained resentment between characters, serious issues of domestic violence which we weren't particularly invested enough in to appreciate the resolution, and a sex-deprived housewife that flew under the radar for most of the film turning out to be the catalyst for much of the deception the group's captor was wanting everyone to confess. It's confusing, with so many pitchforks in the road, and the film fails to tie it all together, let alone make believable a longstanding relationship and history with this group of people. This was a film, fails to hit the notes of romance, horror but wins out on some comedic moments but I didn't have to watch. There will be some appreciation value for McHale and Bishe fans most definitely.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-03-19","keywords":"visit","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3428565273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlmZjAyN2QtNjFiNS00YWNmLWFjYmItOTRlY2YxNzczOWY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlmZjAyN2QtNjFiNS00YWNmLWFjYmItOTRlY2YxNzczOWY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A happily married couple (Joel McHale and Kerry Bishé) discover their friends are resentful of their lustful relationship.

If she doesn't find him, her family will be turned out to the Ozarks. Challenging her outlaw kin's code of silence and risking her life, Ree hacks through the lies, evasions and threats offered up by her relatives and begins to piece together the truth.\n\nLet me, just begin by saying this movie is perfectly acted. Jennifer Lawrence gives an Oscar Worthy performance as Rolly Dee. I was surprised how excellent she was, because I was sceptical of her in the "The Bill Engvall" show. But she turned me to a believer and boy, she can REALLY act. Her performance actually surpasses some of Meryl Streep's performances. Hopefully the Academy will recognize her and give an Oscar nomination or maybe even a win! The film is well directed by Debra Granik and is easily her best work yet. She definitely has potential to become the "new" Kathryn Bigelow. Anyways the film is really bleak and powerful, but it still has a tone of hopeful in it. Very interesting and mesmerizing movie to watch. It is a bit slow at times, but trust me it never gets boring or dull.\n\n10/10 Highly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139544,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-07-16","keywords":"ozark mountains,family relationships,drug trade,family crisis,search for father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winter's Bone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3239184153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"17 year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) sets out to track down her father, who put their house up for his bail bond and then disappeared.

If she doesn't find him, her family will be turned out to the Ozarks. Challenging her outlaw kin's code of silence and risking her life, Ree hacks through the lies, evasions and threats offered up by her relatives and begins to piece together the truth.\n\nLet me, just begin by saying this movie is perfectly acted. Jennifer Lawrence gives an Oscar Worthy performance as Rolly Dee. I was surprised how excellent she was, because I was sceptical of her in the "The Bill Engvall" show. But she turned me to a believer and boy, she can REALLY act. Her performance actually surpasses some of Meryl Streep's performances. Hopefully the Academy will recognize her and give an Oscar nomination or maybe even a win! The film is well directed by Debra Granik and is easily her best work yet. She definitely has potential to become the "new" Kathryn Bigelow. Anyways the film is really bleak and powerful, but it still has a tone of hopeful in it. Very interesting and mesmerizing movie to watch. It is a bit slow at times, but trust me it never gets boring or dull.\n\n10/10 Highly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139544,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-07-16","keywords":"ozark mountains,family relationships,drug trade,family crisis,search for father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winter's Bone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3239184153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"17 year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) sets out to track down her father, who put their house up for his bail bond and then disappeared.

It's just the right time to watch a movie like "Mossad" written and directed by Alon Gur Arye, a parody in the genre of the "Naked Gun" series that combined comedy and espionage made in the 1990s by the American ZAZ trio (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), or of the British films that had as a hero Johnny English (played by Rowan Atkinson), back on screen last year. I saw the movie yesterday evening at its first or second public screening, before the official premiere, in a cinema hall that was full with an audience that reacted enthusiastically. I can bet that a new Israeli cult comedy is about to be born, and that Britain's secret agent Johnny English has now a serious Israeli rival in the secret agent Guy Moran (interpreted by Tsahi Halevi), equally ready to save the world risking to destroy it ten times.\n\nThe satirical arrows in this cinematic parody genre are usually directed towards two main directions - a "serious" theme from an area of activity with visibility and of major interest for the public (in this case the fight against terrorism and the secret wars led by the national spy organizations - Mossad, CIA) and the 'serious' movies related to this theme (here the action films and series such as 'James Bond', 'Mission Impossible', etc.). In order to succeed, such films should avoid dealing with any of the 'sacred cows' and should include as many jokes as possible with references to known realities or famous films, all packed in a story which aims to be coherent but is explicitly not taken too seriously. I think the screenwriter and director Alon Gur Arye has very honorably succeeded to meet these conditions and the result is a fun and engaging movie.\n\nThe pace of jokes and comic situations is considerable and these are present from the first frame before the generic to the last one at the final credits. I'm not convinced that everything will pass the screen to the international audiences, and as the screening had English subtitles I noticed that some adaptations are being attempted. The level of satire and critical humor dealing with the bombastic myths, local bureaucracy, or typology of secret war heroes did not seem to me to fall under anything else in the genre, the latest 'Johnny English', for example. I can say the same thing about the level of acting - Dvir Benedek and Tsahi Halevi are excellent in the key roles, the feminine presences are attractive and expressive, Tal Friedman creates an original role that makes us forget his appearances in popular comic television programs, and the Israeli screen and stage veterans Gila Almador and Ilan Dar act in the movie with obvious pleasure. They all have fun and make us have fun. The less successful parts of this film are related to the coherence of the action (there is no moment of real suspense) and the special effects that have suffered from a clear lack of funds, with results visible today in the era of spectacular graphic effects. These details cannot spoil too much of the pleasure I had watching "Mossad", which has good chances to be the summer blockbuster in Israel, and to be successful elsewhere and beyond its first season of screening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-06-27","keywords":"parody,mossad,israel,airplane,reference to naked gun","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"MOSSAD!

I can say the same thing about the level of acting - Dvir Benedek and Tsahi Halevi are excellent in the key roles, the feminine presences are attractive and expressive, Tal Friedman creates an original role that makes us forget his appearances in popular comic television programs, and the Israeli screen and stage veterans Gila Almador and Ilan Dar act in the movie with obvious pleasure. They all have fun and make us have fun. The less successful parts of this film are related to the coherence of the action (there is no moment of real suspense) and the special effects that have suffered from a clear lack of funds, with results visible today in the era of spectacular graphic effects. These details cannot spoil too much of the pleasure I had watching "Mossad", which has good chances to be the summer blockbuster in Israel, and to be successful elsewhere and beyond its first season of screening.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-06-27","keywords":"parody,mossad,israel,airplane,reference to naked gun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"MOSSAD!

How he walks, how he stands. I remember thinking that Jake Gyllenhaal had borrowed that physicality for his character in "Brokeback Mountain" and I just realized that Larry McMurtry is the author of both "Brokeback Mountain" and "Hud". He provides us with a look into the modern cowboy that is not only unique but mesmerizing. Paul Newman's Hud is a cad and yet you feel we sense that behind the bravado hides a desperate man looking for something. Something personal and unspoken. Hud is one of my favorite Newman performances. Soulless and yet needy.

How he walks, how he stands. I remember thinking that Jake Gyllenhaal had borrowed that physicality for his character in "Brokeback Mountain" and I just realized that Larry McMurtry is the author of both "Brokeback Mountain" and "Hud". He provides us with a look into the modern cowboy that is not only unique but mesmerizing. Paul Newman's Hud is a cad and yet you feel we sense that behind the bravado hides a desperate man looking for something. Something personal and unspoken. Hud is one of my favorite Newman performances. Soulless and yet needy. Is it a coincidence that the only woman that"got away" from Hud is named Alma? - Alma in Spanish means soul - Alma is played by Patricia Neal with power and humanity and she won the Oscar for it.

However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3740,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-22","keywords":"china,non linear,nonlinear timeline,hospital,loss of son","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1042071321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4592524/","name":"Jingchun Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3619308/","name":"Mei Yong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5035471/","name":"Xi Qi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0514744/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461717/","name":"Mei Ah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"duration":"PT3H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3740,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-22","keywords":"china,non linear,nonlinear timeline,hospital,loss of son","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1042071321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4592524/","name":"Jingchun Wang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3619308/","name":"Mei Yong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5035471/","name":"Xi Qi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0514744/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461717/","name":"Mei Ah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"],"duration":"PT3H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The acting is'nt Oscar worthy or anything like it but the characters do have some charm and when they are put in danger you care what happens to them which is always a good sign. It does suffer a little from a bloated and anti climatic ending that is funny for about 2 minutes but I wont spoil it for you none the less. I give the Lost World its high rating because it does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain us.

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. \n\nYou have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. \n\nEdge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. \n\nThe tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both.

The story follows American "teenager" Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) whose reckless driving lands him prison time, but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo.

While I talk negatives, the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95% of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don't mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn't present!\n\nBut, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: "It's not about the ride, it's about the rider") from Sean's fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious "king of a little hill" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.\n\nThere's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258134,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-23","keywords":"yakuza,chase,showdown,dominic toretto character,han seoul oh character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Everything We Know About 'F9'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2943402009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk5ODI0YjUtN2VkYy00YTgyLTg5NGQtYmE1MzQ4MTVhOTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk5ODI0YjUtN2VkYy00YTgyLTg5NGQtYmE1MzQ4MTVhOTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief we put the pedal to the metal on the Fast Saga and everything you need to know about 'F9' (2021)."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085407/","name":"Lucas Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117022/","name":"Zachery Ty Bryan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510168/","name":"Shad Moss"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510912/","name":"Justin Lin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0604555/","name":"Chris Morgan"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn't present!\n\nBut, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: "It's not about the ride, it's about the rider") from Sean's fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious "king of a little hill" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.\n\nThere's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258134,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-23","keywords":"yakuza,chase,showdown,dominic toretto character,han seoul oh character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Everything We Know About 'F9'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2943402009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk5ODI0YjUtN2VkYy00YTgyLTg5NGQtYmE1MzQ4MTVhOTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk5ODI0YjUtN2VkYy00YTgyLTg5NGQtYmE1MzQ4MTVhOTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief we put the pedal to the metal on the Fast Saga and everything you need to know about 'F9' (2021).","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085407/","name":"Lucas Black","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117022/","name":"Zachery Ty Bryan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510168/","name":"Shad Moss"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510912/","name":"Justin Lin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0604555/","name":"Chris Morgan"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story is about a suburban family moves to a new neighborhood with their large yet lovable Great Dane, who has a tendency to wreak havoc in his own oblivious way. Marmaduke is mainly intended for little kids, some adults may enjoy it others might feel light a living hell. The movie has some funny moments and others are kinda foolish. The CGI to make the animals talk are nothing out of this world but decent enough. The story is a little predictable. The cast of voices are the best thing with Owen Wilson as Marmaduke, Fergie as Jezebel, Kiefer Sutherland as Bosco and George Lopez as Carlos. We also have Lee Pace and Judy Greer as Phil and Debbie Winslow, Marmaduke's owners and William H. Macy as Pace's boss. In conclusion, Kids will love Marmaduke and for one strange reason I enjoy it. So if you have children and a very big patience, take them to see this movie. If not well its your choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2010-06-04","keywords":"great dane,dog,rivalry,talking animal,bowl","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1396835353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339460/","name":"Judy Greer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1195855/","name":"Lee Pace"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0223359/","name":"Tom Dey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711422/","name":"Tim Rasmussen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224084/","name":"Vince Di Meglio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1685870/","name":"Brad Anderson"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story is about a suburban family moves to a new neighborhood with their large yet lovable Great Dane, who has a tendency to wreak havoc in his own oblivious way. Marmaduke is mainly intended for little kids, some adults may enjoy it others might feel light a living hell. The movie has some funny moments and others are kinda foolish. The CGI to make the animals talk are nothing out of this world but decent enough. The story is a little predictable. The cast of voices are the best thing with Owen Wilson as Marmaduke, Fergie as Jezebel, Kiefer Sutherland as Bosco and George Lopez as Carlos. We also have Lee Pace and Judy Greer as Phil and Debbie Winslow, Marmaduke's owners and William H. Macy as Pace's boss. In conclusion, Kids will love Marmaduke and for one strange reason I enjoy it. So if you have children and a very big patience, take them to see this movie. If not well its your choice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2010-06-04","keywords":"great dane,dog,rivalry,talking animal,bowl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1396835353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMjczNzAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0NzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Marmaduke: Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339460/","name":"Judy Greer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1195855/","name":"Lee Pace"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0223359/","name":"Tom Dey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711422/","name":"Tim Rasmussen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224084/","name":"Vince Di Meglio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1685870/","name":"Brad Anderson"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Set presumably some time after Day of the Dead, the plot focuses on a human population that has managed to survive by barricading themselves within the "remains" of Pittsburgh by means of guards and electrified fences (as well as rivers that are bordering the city). The rich reside in a tower called Fiddler's Green but everyone else is forced to live in the streets, with only the false hope of being able to attain high-class status.\n\nOne guy dissatisfied with living in the streets, Cholo (John Leguizamo), doesn't take kindly to the mayor's (Dennis Hopper) refusal, especially having been his lackey for three years with the expectation of reward. So Cholo steals the armored vehicle Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green unless he gets his five million dollars (which is the amount needed to get high-class status, but did he really expect to be welcomed into Fiddler's Green with open arms after this incident?). Refusing to cooperate, the mayor hires Riley (Simon Baker) to bring Dead Reckoning back. Meanwhile, the undead are planning to invade the city thanks to the evolving zombie called Big Daddy, and given this couldn't happen at a worst possible time, you can guess what'll happen next.\n\nI'm going to put it bluntly, this film is by far the worst of Romero's zombie movies, lacking in so many ways that I would still feel the same way even if I didn't have its predecessors to compare it with. But there are its predecessors, and having already seen three prior films in which characters must hold off scores of zombies at bay from inside some "safe" location before it's ultimately penetrated by the undead, let's just say seeing this a fourth time gets a little repetitive.\n\nThe film does have elements worth appreciating, the cinematography is excellent and easily the best of the series; I especially loved the stylish and creepy nighttime shot of zombies shuffling within a fog-shrouded forest. The movie is also the most action-packed of the series, so the non-stop gunfire keeps the movie watchable. The production values are also pretty good considering the budgetary limitations (some of the f/x still look pretty weak, though).\n\nOtherwise, LOTD is rushed, unfulfilling, and does little its predecessors haven't already accomplished. What new material it does aim for is poorly conceived, a shocker considering Romero's had twenty years to mull over this material. Take the city, for instance, it's never fully explained how the monetary system works or where the electricity is coming from. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the latter in Dawn of the Dead, but I'm not willing to let Romero pull the same trick twice, especially when the inner workings of the city should have been further explored. \n\nThe movie's social commentary feels like a slapdash effort of contemporary issues tossed together without any real coherency, with characters acting in blatantly idiotic fashion for no other purpose than to continue serving the commentary. The original Dawn of the Dead's commentary on consumerism worked because it was a natural outgrowth of the way the characters' believably behaved (if you had free reign to a mall, you likely wouldn't want to leave, would you?).\n\nYet here, Romero feels compelled to ensure that Hopper's character won't dare negotiate, even preferring to leave the city (to go where exactly?) and kill an associate rather than give up five million bucks. To keep the commentary going, Romero even has Hopper take all his cash with him, even though I had to wonder what it was good for. Considering his demands, the same problem also applies to Cholo. Are there other cities/outposts out there using the same currency as well? If so, why not at least mention it so we don't question the characters' motivations, especially considering it's the basic framework that leads to so many deaths later in the film.\n\nThere are further instances of stupidity, such as Riley choosing not to warn anyone inside the city about Big Daddy. The soldiers protecting the city prove incompetent in almost every fashion, with one guard actually rappelling into a crowd of zombies. Later in the film, there's even a guy who wears headphones while he's outside the city, by himself, and not at all far from known zombie territory. This scene is also indicative of the countless jump scares Romero attempts, all of them obvious and hilariously overdone.\n\nAs for the zombies, there's the storyline involving Big Daddy, an undead gas station attendant who's inexplicably getting smarter. Much of the appeal of zombies is seeing them act out as mindless drones with no other motivation than to eat human flesh. That Big Daddy is able to think and seems to actually want revenge for his fallen zombie brethren completely mutes the sense of dread and terror that came with zombies acting on just pure instinct. \n\nMost astoundingly, Romero takes this a step further and actually wants us to sympathize with the zombies. I shouldn't be surprised by this development, as it's all been clearly leading up to this point since Bub's humanity in Day of the Dead and the constant "they're us, we're them" lines. Doesn't mean I have to like it, especially when the previous installments have made it clear being a zombie isn't something to cherish and the general fact that they like to eat people doesn't exactly make me want to side with them. For me, LOTD continues Romero's downward spiral, and I still haven't liked a movie of his since the 80s."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-24","keywords":"zombie apocalypse,post apocalypse,zombie film,zombie survival,survival horror","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Land of the Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1419051289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000782/","name":"Asia Argento"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048932/","name":"Simon Baker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

I figured Emma Thompson would be good in the title role because you can usually count on her to be entertaining in form or another, cerebrally, emotionally or comically. What I didn't figure on was the fun, extremely colorful story, overall. This was like a banana split for your senses - all kinds of wild treats for the eyes and ears.....to taste, so to speak.\n\nThis film features outrageous color schemes from the word "go," from the interior of the "Brown's" house, to everyone's apparel to the scenery outside. It almost reminded me "The Cat In The Hat" with its crazy colors. \n\nAll the characters are as exaggerated as the colors, too. The kids may be brats but they aren't bad once they get some needed discipline and love from Nanny McPhee. They are still fun to watch, and all are quite different in appearance and mannerisms. Thompson is a howl as Mary Poppins-like McPhee and so are the supporting characters. There were no sappy songs, either.

I figured Emma Thompson would be good in the title role because you can usually count on her to be entertaining in form or another, cerebrally, emotionally or comically. What I didn't figure on was the fun, extremely colorful story, overall. This was like a banana split for your senses - all kinds of wild treats for the eyes and ears.....to taste, so to speak.\n\nThis film features outrageous color schemes from the word "go," from the interior of the "Brown's" house, to everyone's apparel to the scenery outside. It almost reminded me "The Cat In The Hat" with its crazy colors. \n\nAll the characters are as exaggerated as the colors, too. The kids may be brats but they aren't bad once they get some needed discipline and love from Nanny McPhee. They are still fun to watch, and all are quite different in appearance and mannerisms. Thompson is a howl as Mary Poppins-like McPhee and so are the supporting characters. There were no sappy songs, either. This is not a musical.\n\nThe only character annoying to me was the kids' dad, played by Colin Firth. The actor was fine but his character was so wishy-washy, so wussy, he was barely tolerable for much of the film. By the way, you might not recognize the famous Angela Lansbury in here.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why?

Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly.

He is also able to act well beside some other strong performances from good actors like Max Von Sydow and a strong Colin Farrell. The rest of the cast has some famous faces like Ayre Gross, Sam Morton, Tim Blake Nelson, Stormare etc but outside of them really it's Cruise all the way.\n\nOverall it may disappoint the Jurassic Park/Matrix audience expecting a fast, action packed thriller  the marketing makes it look like the Matrix when really it's much more like the noir of Bladerunner.

Gleaming eyed and bushy tailed, Cruise has played the roll of the hero in many films and is certainly the richer for it.\n\nSomething happened along the way, though. Cruise wanted to be considered a legitimate actor, rather than merely a "movie star." Therefore, we've seen him go against type, successfully (MAGNOLIA), and not so much (THE LAST SAMURAI). It's as if Cruise is the neglected kid in the back of the classroom who knows all of the answers but is never called upon, and therefore will go to desperate ends for attention. "Oh, Oh!! Pick me!!! Pick me!!!" \n\nFor me, Cruise hit it this time. His character in COLLATERAL is a menacing study in coldness. It is a thoroughly believable depiction of an utterly ruthless hit-man. It seems, finally, Cruise is actually BAD, rather than merely acting bad. He disdains his usual tricks in favor of a simple and very real performance.\n\nLet us not forget Jamie Foxx. His character's transformation into a hero is rendered all the more effective by how wonderfully Foxx captures his character's initial impotence and bewilderment. It's a wonderfully effective, energetic, and yet very subtle performance.\n\nSpecial kudos to Michael Mann. He has a very interesting eye when it comes to capturing the city of Los Angeles on film. His vision of L.A. in this film is one of unease and uncertainty, hardly the usual glitz and glamor treatment. This work is always compelling to the eye and paced to keep the action moving ever forward. Each scene has its own logic, contributing to the overall whole. This is first rate film-making.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":380585,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"los angeles california,taxi driver,taxi,contract killer,driving at night","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Collateral","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi448725273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gleaming eyed and bushy tailed, Cruise has played the roll of the hero in many films and is certainly the richer for it.\n\nSomething happened along the way, though. Cruise wanted to be considered a legitimate actor, rather than merely a "movie star." Therefore, we've seen him go against type, successfully (MAGNOLIA), and not so much (THE LAST SAMURAI). It's as if Cruise is the neglected kid in the back of the classroom who knows all of the answers but is never called upon, and therefore will go to desperate ends for attention. "Oh, Oh!! Pick me!!! Pick me!!!" \n\nFor me, Cruise hit it this time. His character in COLLATERAL is a menacing study in coldness. It is a thoroughly believable depiction of an utterly ruthless hit-man. It seems, finally, Cruise is actually BAD, rather than merely acting bad. He disdains his usual tricks in favor of a simple and very real performance.\n\nLet us not forget Jamie Foxx. His character's transformation into a hero is rendered all the more effective by how wonderfully Foxx captures his character's initial impotence and bewilderment. It's a wonderfully effective, energetic, and yet very subtle performance.\n\nSpecial kudos to Michael Mann. He has a very interesting eye when it comes to capturing the city of Los Angeles on film. His vision of L.A. in this film is one of unease and uncertainty, hardly the usual glitz and glamor treatment. This work is always compelling to the eye and paced to keep the action moving ever forward. Each scene has its own logic, contributing to the overall whole. This is first rate film-making.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":380585,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"los angeles california,taxi driver,taxi,contract killer,driving at night","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Collateral","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi448725273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle ","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0455824/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jpschapira"},"dateCreated":"2009-01-13","inLanguage":"English","name":"Dreams be dreams","reviewBody":"It seems just about right that Baz Luhrman waited seven years after "Moulin Rouge!" to bring us "Australia". Not because it is a better movie, but because it's very different and a lot more ambitious. Of course that this has a downside, and it's fair to say it as soon as possible: "Australia" is flawed and longer than it should be, and maybe (just maybe) one day it will be viewed as the dream come true of a man very much in love with cinema, and-let's not forget-with love.\n\nWe shouldn't forget that we're talking about Baz Luhrman, we should know what to expect sometimes. Therefore, if the beginning of this film disappoints you a bit, it's completely understandable. We meet a little boy named Nullah (the very promising Brandon Walters), who talks about races and unnamed countries, about a lady everyone calls Mrs. Boss and the road that got her to Australia and more specifically to a place called Faraway Downs in the company of a man they call the Drover.\n\nYes, it's all quite confusing, even more when Luhrman throws in a historical context that, I suspect, he doesn't really care much about. But everything is fine because we get to meet the stars of the show. Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade. Her job ends up being less risky than Hugh Jackman's, who plays this Drover as a successful combination of what he's been giving us since he came into the scene: the action hero, the tough guy, the romantic and sensitive lover and the sexy man who makes women scream.\n\nMaybe I'm not being critical enough, but there's a scene in which the Drover appears dressed up in a suit, clean-shaven I promise you that every women in the theater exhaled. Does this mean something to you? To me, it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments? "Australia" is pure melodrama, and I compliment its director for making it look that way without any shame. The keys can be seen all along the ride: the repetition of clichéd phrases, the intense close-ups, the slow-motion parts of the characters, the epic proportions of David Hirschfelder's score, the establishment of a song that accompanies the characters through their endless journey and the use of narration in places it didn't need to be; the same with some images.\n\nHowever, the movie is one wonderful image after another (cinematographer Mandy Walker, from Australia-the country-; best of luck with the Oscar nomination you deserve), and it wins the audience like few movies out there these days can, providing delightful entertainment; you may discuss if it does this fairly, or if it cheats and it manipulates.

Not because it is a better movie, but because it's very different and a lot more ambitious. Of course that this has a downside, and it's fair to say it as soon as possible: "Australia" is flawed and longer than it should be, and maybe (just maybe) one day it will be viewed as the dream come true of a man very much in love with cinema, and-let's not forget-with love.\n\nWe shouldn't forget that we're talking about Baz Luhrman, we should know what to expect sometimes. Therefore, if the beginning of this film disappoints you a bit, it's completely understandable. We meet a little boy named Nullah (the very promising Brandon Walters), who talks about races and unnamed countries, about a lady everyone calls Mrs. Boss and the road that got her to Australia and more specifically to a place called Faraway Downs in the company of a man they call the Drover.\n\nYes, it's all quite confusing, even more when Luhrman throws in a historical context that, I suspect, he doesn't really care much about. But everything is fine because we get to meet the stars of the show. Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade. Her job ends up being less risky than Hugh Jackman's, who plays this Drover as a successful combination of what he's been giving us since he came into the scene: the action hero, the tough guy, the romantic and sensitive lover and the sexy man who makes women scream.\n\nMaybe I'm not being critical enough, but there's a scene in which the Drover appears dressed up in a suit, clean-shaven I promise you that every women in the theater exhaled. Does this mean something to you? To me, it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments? "Australia" is pure melodrama, and I compliment its director for making it look that way without any shame. The keys can be seen all along the ride: the repetition of clichéd phrases, the intense close-ups, the slow-motion parts of the characters, the epic proportions of David Hirschfelder's score, the establishment of a song that accompanies the characters through their endless journey and the use of narration in places it didn't need to be; the same with some images.\n\nHowever, the movie is one wonderful image after another (cinematographer Mandy Walker, from Australia-the country-; best of luck with the Oscar nomination you deserve), and it wins the audience like few movies out there these days can, providing delightful entertainment; you may discuss if it does this fairly, or if it cheats and it manipulates. You may also discuss the ambiguous ending.\n\nOne more thing. As with any dream, there's a moment in which we wake up; and that moment for Luhrman has to do with believing his picture could get to the race of Best Picture contenders, like his fantastic "Moulin Rouge!". But as I said, this movie is very different from the latter one, and Luhrman is no James Cameron That one really had it the whole way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Of the new cast Miller is a fine addition as the awkward Allen, Jason Momoa gives fans hope that his standalone Aquaman will be a lot of fun, while it's surprising just how affecting Ray Fisher is as Cyborg even if his character doesn't seem cut out to get his own standalone feature.\n\nIt's a shame then that we don't ever feel like this team is given the scenarios they needed to really gel together. There's chemistry to be found here, even Cavill and Affleck benefit from the likes of Gadot and the new additions, their rather tiresome portrayals enlivened by the fresh, energetic nature of their co-stars but overall the film lacks an energy or pizazz that would've been the kicker to elevate this genuine middle of the road experience to something else entirely.\n\nFinal Say – \n\nAll in all huge fans of DC will be kept happy with this sometimes enjoyable, sometimes downright bad big screen culmination of hero's and one badly CGI'd and generic villain.\n\nDevoid of anything of true note and without a memorable set-piece, Justice League is unquestionably the poor cousin of The Avenger's but with the talented cast involved, there is enough hope here to suggest that this band of hero's have some room to grow into something special if all the stars align.\n\n2 1/2 terrorised Russian families out of 5","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":426559,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-11-16","keywords":"justice league,superhero team,superhero,dc extended universe,comicbook movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Justice League Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2454436121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmFhZmFlMGEtMjRjZS00MDUyLTllNWEtNzhhZGZjZTAwZjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmFhZmFlMGEtMjRjZS00MDUyLTllNWEtNzhhZGZjZTAwZjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"Extended Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2933757/","name":"Gal Gadot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0597388/","name":"Jason Momoa"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0430860/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796950/","name":"Jerry Siegel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795975/","name":"Joe Shuster"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006516/","name":"Chris Terrio"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Of the new cast Miller is a fine addition as the awkward Allen, Jason Momoa gives fans hope that his standalone Aquaman will be a lot of fun, while it's surprising just how affecting Ray Fisher is as Cyborg even if his character doesn't seem cut out to get his own standalone feature.\n\nIt's a shame then that we don't ever feel like this team is given the scenarios they needed to really gel together. There's chemistry to be found here, even Cavill and Affleck benefit from the likes of Gadot and the new additions, their rather tiresome portrayals enlivened by the fresh, energetic nature of their co-stars but overall the film lacks an energy or pizazz that would've been the kicker to elevate this genuine middle of the road experience to something else entirely.\n\nFinal Say – \n\nAll in all huge fans of DC will be kept happy with this sometimes enjoyable, sometimes downright bad big screen culmination of hero's and one badly CGI'd and generic villain.\n\nDevoid of anything of true note and without a memorable set-piece, Justice League is unquestionably the poor cousin of The Avenger's but with the talented cast involved, there is enough hope here to suggest that this band of hero's have some room to grow into something special if all the stars align.\n\n2 1/2 terrorised Russian families out of 5","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":426559,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-11-16","keywords":"justice league,superhero team,superhero,dc extended universe,comicbook movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Justice League Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2454436121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmFhZmFlMGEtMjRjZS00MDUyLTllNWEtNzhhZGZjZTAwZjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmFhZmFlMGEtMjRjZS00MDUyLTllNWEtNzhhZGZjZTAwZjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"Extended Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2933757/","name":"Gal Gadot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0597388/","name":"Jason Momoa"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0430860/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796950/","name":"Jerry Siegel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795975/","name":"Joe Shuster","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006516/","name":"Chris Terrio"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: "Lifting." It features a novice "animator" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.\n\nCount on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.\n\nIn this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by "the critic." So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.\n\nIt appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how "Ted's law" is followed: the distance between the "real" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the "living cartoon" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.\n\nSo these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.\n\nHaving said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.\n\nOne of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)\n\nYou can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.\n\nBut there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.\n\nThere's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.\n\nThe credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ""Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film." You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.\n\nIts a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.\n\nOne character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. \n\nThese folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":672861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-08-22","keywords":"rat,chef,ratatouille,cooking,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ratatouille","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906147865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2, Post"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004951/","name":"Brad Garrett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738918/","name":"Lou Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135296/","name":"Jim Capobianco"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.\n\nIn this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by "the critic." So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.\n\nIt appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how "Ted's law" is followed: the distance between the "real" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the "living cartoon" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.\n\nSo these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.\n\nHaving said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.\n\nOne of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)\n\nYou can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.\n\nBut there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.\n\nThere's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.\n\nThe credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ""Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film." You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.\n\nIts a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.\n\nOne character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. \n\nThese folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":672861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-08-22","keywords":"rat,chef,ratatouille,cooking,paris france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ratatouille","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906147865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2, Post","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004951/","name":"Brad Garrett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738918/","name":"Lou Romano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135296/","name":"Jim Capobianco"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":691185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted. This sequel comes off as a afterthought worthy to stand beside the other spinoff LEGO films, but lacks all of the magic of its predecessor.\n\nThe magic present in The LEGO Movie resides in the playful allegory of capitalism mixed with the earned nostalgia of the animation's medium. Not to mention the brilliant reveal of a child's imagination directing the entire story. These are all elements revisited the second time around, but the trick has already been explained by the magician. The world of Brickville goes through sufficient changes almost immediately once toddler-sized LEGO creations attack with unrivaled fury. The brick civilization reverts to a Mad Max world after the invincible fat-bricked organisms regularly search and destroy anything colorful or shiny.\n\nThrough some less-than-subtle live action mirage shots early in the film, its apparent that Finn (Jadon Sand) the boy mastermind in the first film is being plagued by his younger sister Bianca (Brooklynn Prince). Her entry-level LEGO creations clash with his more involved and complex structures, and the result is a sibling pair never learning to play in symbiosis. Of course this conflict is merely implied before the lazy live action finale that resolves the paper thin dispute, and wholly lacks the gusto of the first movie's twist. The jig is already up from scene one of the sequel, because we are aware of the children's narrative dictatorship, so none of the LEGO characters' sentience ever feels authentic.\n\nChris Pratt returns to voice Emmet a happy-go-lucky construction worker who retains a life of cheer in the apocalyptic wasteland. Elizabeth Banks also reprises her role as Lucy, the brawn and brains to Emmet's fumbling optimism. Lucy desperately attempts to calibrate Emmet's persona to something more appropriate to the ruined world they now live in, but he maintains the "everything is awesome" outlook that figures problematic in a much more adult environment. In a hardly tongue-in-cheek fashion, a character outright states the thesis of the movie to be "a statement on the waning affects of adolescence on imagination." This stands as the most egregious example of "meta exploitation," but several runner ups tail close behind.\n\nFalling victim to exhausting cleverness, LEGO Movie 2 doesn't know when to edit its goofs. When you merely reformat the first film's plot to fit another child builder, new additions need to elevate the otherwise regurgitated formula. These additions include ramping up the meta meter to 11 and including two more banger tracks to hopefully burrow into the viewers' minds. The main attraction song here has a hook the repeats endlessly, "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head." Oh and I mustn't forget the cameos, which come with This is the End regularity, and if you can imagine, with far less originality.\n\nI didn't waste your time by running you down a plot synopsis for good reason.

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted. This sequel comes off as a afterthought worthy to stand beside the other spinoff LEGO films, but lacks all of the magic of its predecessor.\n\nThe magic present in The LEGO Movie resides in the playful allegory of capitalism mixed with the earned nostalgia of the animation's medium. Not to mention the brilliant reveal of a child's imagination directing the entire story. These are all elements revisited the second time around, but the trick has already been explained by the magician. The world of Brickville goes through sufficient changes almost immediately once toddler-sized LEGO creations attack with unrivaled fury. The brick civilization reverts to a Mad Max world after the invincible fat-bricked organisms regularly search and destroy anything colorful or shiny.\n\nThrough some less-than-subtle live action mirage shots early in the film, its apparent that Finn (Jadon Sand) the boy mastermind in the first film is being plagued by his younger sister Bianca (Brooklynn Prince). Her entry-level LEGO creations clash with his more involved and complex structures, and the result is a sibling pair never learning to play in symbiosis. Of course this conflict is merely implied before the lazy live action finale that resolves the paper thin dispute, and wholly lacks the gusto of the first movie's twist. The jig is already up from scene one of the sequel, because we are aware of the children's narrative dictatorship, so none of the LEGO characters' sentience ever feels authentic.\n\nChris Pratt returns to voice Emmet a happy-go-lucky construction worker who retains a life of cheer in the apocalyptic wasteland. Elizabeth Banks also reprises her role as Lucy, the brawn and brains to Emmet's fumbling optimism. Lucy desperately attempts to calibrate Emmet's persona to something more appropriate to the ruined world they now live in, but he maintains the "everything is awesome" outlook that figures problematic in a much more adult environment. In a hardly tongue-in-cheek fashion, a character outright states the thesis of the movie to be "a statement on the waning affects of adolescence on imagination." This stands as the most egregious example of "meta exploitation," but several runner ups tail close behind.\n\nFalling victim to exhausting cleverness, LEGO Movie 2 doesn't know when to edit its goofs. When you merely reformat the first film's plot to fit another child builder, new additions need to elevate the otherwise regurgitated formula. These additions include ramping up the meta meter to 11 and including two more banger tracks to hopefully burrow into the viewers' minds. The main attraction song here has a hook the repeats endlessly, "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head." Oh and I mustn't forget the cameos, which come with This is the End regularity, and if you can imagine, with far less originality.\n\nI didn't waste your time by running you down a plot synopsis for good reason. The film plays with your expectations in a cheap and unearned fashion without offering any reasonable explanation upon the conclusion other than, "We just wanted to plant red herrings, because...reasons." Screenwriters will go to great (and absurd) lengths to make an unoriginal script appear more interesting. This parasitic sequel will deliver many chuckles and feels to audiences that have already surrendered to the committee-made trajectory of the LEGO universe, but I feel somber for those choosing to double feature this lackadaisical copy with its bold predecessor.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60566,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film.

She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders. The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller.

His recent appearances on the TV promotional circuit have proved this once again. Those who only know his films since LA Confidential for the most part focus on his ability to capture and project power, strength and inner turmoil. Those who have seen his films such as Proof, For the Moment, Love In Limbo and The Sum of Us have seen his ability to show the gentler, funnier and often more uncertain sides of the human experience. (I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man.) A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it's likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated, oversexed, over special "effected" and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out. Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92043,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"chateau,provence france,inheritance,based on novel,wine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Good Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1823736089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180411/","name":"Abbie Cornish"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458884/","name":"Marc Klein"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562706/","name":"Peter Mayle"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His recent appearances on the TV promotional circuit have proved this once again. Those who only know his films since LA Confidential for the most part focus on his ability to capture and project power, strength and inner turmoil. Those who have seen his films such as Proof, For the Moment, Love In Limbo and The Sum of Us have seen his ability to show the gentler, funnier and often more uncertain sides of the human experience. (I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man.) A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it's likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated, oversexed, over special "effected" and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out. Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92043,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"chateau,provence france,inheritance,based on novel,wine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Good Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1823736089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180411/","name":"Abbie Cornish","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458884/","name":"Marc Klein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562706/","name":"Peter Mayle"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In recent years, however, most of these have been multi-part series made for television, a medium which often seems better equipped to deal with Dickens's complexities than does the cinema. The most popular of his works in the cinema has been "A Christmas Carol", which is a novella rather than a novel, followed by "Oliver Twist" and "Great Expectations", both of which are among his shorter novels, and which are often simplified for the screen. Roman Polanski's recent "Oliver Twist", for example, omitted many of Dickens's details and sub-plots in order to concentrate on the essence of the story.\n\n"Nicholas Nickleby", by contrast, is one of Dickens's lengthier novels, so it was perhaps a brave move to adapt it for the screen. The title character is the son of an impoverished country gentleman. When his father dies heavily in debt, young Nicholas sets out for London with his mother and sister Kate, hoping that his wealthy uncle Ralph will be able to help them. Ralph, however, proves to be arrogant, cold-hearted and avaricious. He takes Kate into his home, motivated not by kindness but by the hope that he might be able to marry her off to his business associate, Sir Mulberry Hawke. He sends Nicholas to Yorkshire to work as an assistant teacher in a run-down boys' boarding school, run by a sadistic headmaster named Wackford Squeers. Nicholas is appalled not only by Squeers's ignorance but also by his neglect of and cruelty towards the boys in his care; he is eventually forced to leave the school after intervening to prevent Squeers beating a crippled boy named Smike, who will play an important role in future plot developments. After a brief interval as an actor, Nicholas returns to London to be reunited with his family.\n\nDickens's villains are generally more memorable than his heroes (and even more so than his heroines, who are often rather colourless), and that is reflected in this film. Even an actress as lovely as Anne Hathaway tends to fade into the background as the saintly Madeline, Nicholas's love-interest. Romola Garai is rather livelier as the spirited Kate, and Charlie Hunnam makes her brother an honourable and brave, if headstrong, hero. The performances that stand out, however, are from Jim Broadbent as the vicious Squeers, Juliet Stephenson as his equally unpleasant wife, Edward Fox as the dissipated lecher Sir Mulberry (who turns his attentions to Madeline when he realises that Kate is not for him) and Christopher Plummer as Ralph, outwardly calm and rational but inwardly cold and stony-hearted, a man who cares for nobody except himself and for nothing except his bank balance. It is noteworthy that Ralph's luxurious house is filled with stuffed animals and birds, presumably intended to symbolise his cruelty and sadism. The one piece of casting I didn't like was that of "Dame Edna Everage" (a creation of the Australian comedian Barry Humphries) as Mrs Crummles; the idea of a fictitious female character being played by another fictitious character, who is herself being played by a male actor, is a bizarre, almost surreal, one. The only place for a pantomime dame is in a pantomime.\n\nThere have been complaints on this board that some reviewers' favourite characters or episodes from the novel have been omitted from the film, but such simplification is inevitable if a nine hundred page novel is to be adapted into a feature film with a running time of just over two hours. What matters is that the feel of the film is authentically Dickensian, and this is achieved here, not only through the recreation, in best "heritage cinema" style, of the England of the 1840s, but also through the steadily growing sense that good will triumph over evil, that the heroes will be vindicated and that the villains will receive their just deserts. This is a very good Dickens adaptation, on a par with Polanski's film and much better than Alfonso Cuaron's eccentric "Great Expectations". 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-06-27","keywords":"uncle nephew relationship,based on novel,alliterative title,1850s,character name as title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nicholas Nickleby","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007237913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkNjM4NDAtMjczZS00NWUyLWJlZTAtZjdjZGQyY2IwNmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkNjM4NDAtMjczZS00NWUyLWJlZTAtZjdjZGQyY2IwNmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Nicholas Nickleby"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0402271/","name":"Charlie Hunnam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068260/","name":"Jamie Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001626/","name":"Christopher Plummer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569790/","name":"Douglas McGrath"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037384/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002042/","name":"Charles Dickens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569790/","name":"Douglas McGrath"}],"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Because, surely this is competent, perhaps more than competent, professional, well shot. I will put aside for the moment that there is no characterization to speak of here, that it is flimsy as procedural, that its politics are unnecessarily uncomplicated (good CIA battles evil Islam), its tone uncertain, with all the goofy movie-making stuff sticking out like a sore thumb. The film is soulless, painting by numbers. \n\nThe movie was fake after all, but the mission was real.\n\nIn Affleck's case, there is something worse. Because you see, he does not attempt to 'write history with lightning', as was said about Birth of a Nation a century ago. He softly rewrites the thing. The Canadian stuff has (rightfully) received the most backlash. Imagine this—the CIA analyst who advised Affleck, there had to be one, thought it would be a good idea to end this insinuating the CIA did all the job, but graciously let Canada reap the publicity. \n\nBut this was too blunt and it backfired, bringing to the fore the more subtle marginalization of Canadian intelligence work all through the film, which otherwise would have perhaps passed with little notice. The film after all establishes that the Canadian ambassador has taken the six in, even though in his fleeting screen time, he hovers about as a 'kindly concierge', as another reviewer put it.\n\nYou will see a more insidious version of this mentality in the opening few minutes of the film, sketching past US intervention in Iran—the film admits US backing of the Shah and his oppressive regime into power, human rights abuses and so on, but curiously, this part is mainly animated in the form of storyboards, mirroring those we see later of the fake film, as something near- mythical that happened in another time and world. Smart.\n\nSo, why the heck are we celebrating Affleck? The film shows him to be a blockhead who can put the camera sometimes in the right place."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":591648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"iran,hostage,u.s. embassy,escape,american embassy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537319449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.

Because, surely this is competent, perhaps more than competent, professional, well shot. I will put aside for the moment that there is no characterization to speak of here, that it is flimsy as procedural, that its politics are unnecessarily uncomplicated (good CIA battles evil Islam), its tone uncertain, with all the goofy movie-making stuff sticking out like a sore thumb. The film is soulless, painting by numbers. \n\nThe movie was fake after all, but the mission was real.\n\nIn Affleck's case, there is something worse. Because you see, he does not attempt to 'write history with lightning', as was said about Birth of a Nation a century ago. He softly rewrites the thing. The Canadian stuff has (rightfully) received the most backlash. Imagine this—the CIA analyst who advised Affleck, there had to be one, thought it would be a good idea to end this insinuating the CIA did all the job, but graciously let Canada reap the publicity. \n\nBut this was too blunt and it backfired, bringing to the fore the more subtle marginalization of Canadian intelligence work all through the film, which otherwise would have perhaps passed with little notice. The film after all establishes that the Canadian ambassador has taken the six in, even though in his fleeting screen time, he hovers about as a 'kindly concierge', as another reviewer put it.\n\nYou will see a more insidious version of this mentality in the opening few minutes of the film, sketching past US intervention in Iran—the film admits US backing of the Shah and his oppressive regime into power, human rights abuses and so on, but curiously, this part is mainly animated in the form of storyboards, mirroring those we see later of the fake film, as something near- mythical that happened in another time and world. Smart.\n\nSo, why the heck are we celebrating Affleck? The film shows him to be a blockhead who can put the camera sometimes in the right place.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":591648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"iran,hostage,u.s. embassy,escape,american embassy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537319449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.

Think "Chocolat". Think "Amelie". Think "What dreams may come". Perhaps even, "Being John Malkovich". And this year, it's time to think big... "Big Fish", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H"agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.\n\nAfter cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of "Big Fish: The Animated Series" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way, I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish - a franchise or a single movie.

As some may know already, this reviewer is somebody who has a big thing for good concepts (as well as good casts) and a big bugbear of mine is when they are squandered.\n\n'Christmas 9 to 5' doesn't completely waste it, as despite my interest expectations were still not massive. At the same time, it doesn't fully explore it let alone exceed. It does try to do a few things differently, but none of them are executed well enough. As far as 2019 Lifetime Christmas films go, 'Christmas 9 to 5' is neither one of the best or worst and more a watchable middling effort that at the same time doesn't deserve obscurity status.\n\nShall start with the good. The production values are quite nice, some of the scenery being beautiful even. Regardless of questions about authenticity the film for me was easy on the eyes. Some of the soundtrack is nostalgic and appropriately festive. There is evidence of charm and heart and the joy of Christmas is captured well.\n\nTiya Sircar is an amiable lead who really fully engages with her roles without exaggerating. The other casting standout was George Wendt, who is suitably jovial and has a real twinkle in his eye.\n\nLess good sadly was a rather flat Joe Dinicol. There are moments of charm in his chemistry with Sircar, but their chemistry tends to look too awkward and could have done with more initial tension.

As some may know already, this reviewer is somebody who has a big thing for good concepts (as well as good casts) and a big bugbear of mine is when they are squandered.\n\n'Christmas 9 to 5' doesn't completely waste it, as despite my interest expectations were still not massive. At the same time, it doesn't fully explore it let alone exceed. It does try to do a few things differently, but none of them are executed well enough. As far as 2019 Lifetime Christmas films go, 'Christmas 9 to 5' is neither one of the best or worst and more a watchable middling effort that at the same time doesn't deserve obscurity status.\n\nShall start with the good. The production values are quite nice, some of the scenery being beautiful even. Regardless of questions about authenticity the film for me was easy on the eyes. Some of the soundtrack is nostalgic and appropriately festive. There is evidence of charm and heart and the joy of Christmas is captured well.\n\nTiya Sircar is an amiable lead who really fully engages with her roles without exaggerating. The other casting standout was George Wendt, who is suitably jovial and has a real twinkle in his eye.\n\nLess good sadly was a rather flat Joe Dinicol. There are moments of charm in his chemistry with Sircar, but their chemistry tends to look too awkward and could have done with more initial tension. To me it was a mistake for the central chemistry to be introduced late, as a result it did feel too rushed and underdeveloped (it also appears pretty out of the blue). The script is not as cheesy or as schmaltzy as some Lifetime Christmas films can be, but it does feel a bit on the bland side and do agree that it would have easily have passed for a script from 10 plus years ago.\n\nWhile the story has some charming and engaging moments, it doesn't properly come to life consistently as a result of narratively the film being quite thin and doing little new with well worn tropes.

But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions.

Mostly I found that the depiction of Clarence Thomas not exactly weak but basic: for such a man who I may find reprehensible (from before and during his 25 past years on the court), Wendell Pierce gives Thomas as a person, and character in this story, some dignity, and Anita Wright as Clarence Thomas' wife as well. But what about anything else aside from his indignation and sad faces? What else was/is there to Thomas? \n\nMaybe that just wasn't the focus, and director Fumiyama (of last year's surprise critical hit Dope), wanted to keep it on the politics and especially the media - many figures who you might recognize from CNN and elsewhere in cable news pop up as younger selves - certainly keeps a good eye on that. But what does make an impact and what is certainly good to look past the flaws here, are a) Kerry Washington's performance, which is so unwavering in making Anita Hill a figure of sympathy but also aching empathy, completely stripping anything else except this woman and having to put up being solid in front of the committee. And b) how the story and movie treats the whole aspect of how equal rights were not there in 1991, and may still not be (or, to put it another way, despite the changes the struggle is ongoing), for women in this country.\n\nLike the recent People vs OJ series, we get a story that seems to deal a lot in race - Thomas' "High tech lynching" comment that struck an emotional chord for some but was seen as being disingenuous by others - and yet it's really about how women fit it, or certainly do not, in a world full of men. Images of women and how they talk and react, every little thing that they say, is under the kind of scrutiny here that men just don't have to face, at least not to this level. Confirmation is about the representation of a woman's image in politics, in the media, in the public at large, and what that does when up against a "street fight" as one of the raging white male Republican senators says.

It's politics!\n\nI'm from Oslo and I remember this agreement very well. Great acting and a believable portrayal of the process. No Hollywood drama.\n\nI miss the part on how the Americans was informed of the agreement and their reaction.

A group of high-end professional thieves start to feel the heat from the LAPD when they unknowingly leave a clue at their latest heist." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0113277/","name":"Heat","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMwNzUwNjYtZWM5NS00YzMyLWI4NjAtNjM0ZDBiMzE1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of high-end professional thieves start to feel the heat from the LAPD when they unknowingly leave a clue at their latest heist.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0113277/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"mkrusc"},"dateCreated":"2001-01-19","inLanguage":"English","name":"Mann's crime drama delivers","reviewBody":"'Heat,' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann's sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, 'Heat' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.\n\nPerhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the "remnants of dead people."  A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small).  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.\n\nIn addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best, at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And, despite his life of crime, McCauley's human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley.  Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions).  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine's daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.\n\nAnd Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.\n\nBecause of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":609359,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"gun battle,organized crime,honor,criminal investigation,taken in for questioning","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heat: Director's Definitive Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi664516889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Splits"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035930/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"duration":"PT2H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"He's not bad." "He's not that good, either." I may not be remembering that exactly, but it's close.\n\nIt's also never explained why Drew has so much money. He doesn't seem to be very good at his job, which led me to believe maybe a relative owned the company and he got an inheritance. But his family situation, explained late, which I will not give away, does not make this very likely. I will only say wherever his money came from, he doesn't have anyplace to go.\n\nBut nearly everyone else does a good job.\n\nChristina Applegate is the standout performer here, with Alicia always giving everyone attitude until she finally gets to the point where she can stand Drew. If the movie was being made today, Kaley Cuoco would be perfect in the role. That's how similar their styles are.\n\nJames Gandolfini is so good as the overly protective but greedy father. No, he doesn't want this loser around ... oh, wait, you have money? Come on in, son. Tom doesn't continue his generous attitude without conditions, but more money could change his mind.\n\nI saw the name Jennifer Morrison and then forgot about her, but she's not a blonde here. She was so good for so many years as Emma Swan, the real-world daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming who was sent across a portal and eventually met her parents in the same real world. She's not that easy to like here, and while one expects her to be a minor character after what appears to be a breakup, she will be back. She's actually quite good (Emma too had an attitude) but greedy and shallow, and do we really want that for Drew?\n\nLast night I saw Bill Macy as Walter for the first time in years as Norman Lear was honored by the Kennedy Center. That was nice, and it's always good to see him.

"He's not bad." "He's not that good, either." I may not be remembering that exactly, but it's close.\n\nIt's also never explained why Drew has so much money. He doesn't seem to be very good at his job, which led me to believe maybe a relative owned the company and he got an inheritance. But his family situation, explained late, which I will not give away, does not make this very likely. I will only say wherever his money came from, he doesn't have anyplace to go.\n\nBut nearly everyone else does a good job.\n\nChristina Applegate is the standout performer here, with Alicia always giving everyone attitude until she finally gets to the point where she can stand Drew. If the movie was being made today, Kaley Cuoco would be perfect in the role. That's how similar their styles are.\n\nJames Gandolfini is so good as the overly protective but greedy father. No, he doesn't want this loser around ... oh, wait, you have money? Come on in, son. Tom doesn't continue his generous attitude without conditions, but more money could change his mind.\n\nI saw the name Jennifer Morrison and then forgot about her, but she's not a blonde here. She was so good for so many years as Emma Swan, the real-world daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming who was sent across a portal and eventually met her parents in the same real world. She's not that easy to like here, and while one expects her to be a minor character after what appears to be a breakup, she will be back. She's actually quite good (Emma too had an attitude) but greedy and shallow, and do we really want that for Drew?\n\nLast night I saw Bill Macy as Walter for the first time in years as Norman Lear was honored by the Kennedy Center. That was nice, and it's always good to see him. Doo-Dah is the nickname of Drew's "Grandpa" (the reason for the quotes I will not reveal), and despite what they said about him as Scrooge, he is pretty good here.\n\nAnd I will say this about "A Christmas Carol". Everyone in that does such a good job. I especially liked Ghost of Christmas Present. Too bad they have only a few lines.\n\nIt's fun to watch Drew's scheme almost fall apart in several scenes, and to see his family struggle to keep his secret when it becomes necessary.\n\nThe son in Drew's "family" spends lots of time on the computer and looks at porn--and one image is particularly inappropriate but it's better if you learn why by watching--so this is one of several reasons most kids shouldn't see this.\n\nYes, it's silly, and it's formula, and it's not quite family-friendly, but it's fun.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23745,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-10-22","keywords":"snowball fight,singing,photo shoot,loneliness,helicopter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Surviving Christmas","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4052484377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk5OWY2MzMtMzM1NC00NDhmLWEwNDYtOTdmYTBmNDFmMmJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk5OWY2MzMtMzM1NC00NDhmLWEwNDYtOTdmYTBmNDFmMmJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Dreamworks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000775/","name":"Christina Applegate","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001254/","name":"James Gandolfini"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0089889/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033633/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438226/","name":"Deborah Kaplan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253323/","name":"Harry Elfont","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893262/","name":"Jennifer Ventimilia"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Completely due to its special fan base, the like of which has never been seen before or since.\n\nIn order to keep the phenomenon going Gene Roddenberry knew he had to have something special to offer and he did. The continuity from the television series was accomplished effortlessly, in fact one of the new characters Commander William Decker is the son of William Windom who was another starship captain in an episode. More I can't say less I give the plot away.\n\nIn fact Decker played by Stephen Collins would be commanding the newly fitted Enterprise if it were on a routine mission. But with the threat of an immense alien being on a direct path to earth now Admiral James T. Kirk takes command of the starship himself and with Decker reunites all the old crew from the TV series to meet the threat.\n\nFans of the original series will also see the similarities in plot between another episode involving the Enterprise meeting up with an old space probe that now has taken on some new functions. The same idea forms the basis of this film's story although in every way it has been expanded and a new ending conceived. Here's a hint, a budding relationship between Collins and new ship's lieutenant Persis Khambatta is what ultimately saves the earth.\n\nJust as you remember them William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, and Walter Koenig are all back and completely in character as you remember them. The new people Collins, Khambatta and the rest are integrated nicely into the story.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture received three Academy Award nominations, for Best Art&amp;Set Direction, Best Visual Effects, and Best Musical Score. The special effects never overwhelm the telling of a good story which is the primary mission and best asset of the original television series and its successors. \n\nIf you're not a Trekkie before seeing this film, you may be come one upon viewing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Adventure","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1979-12-08","keywords":"alien,voyager spacecraft,transporter malfunction,leonard mccoy character,montgomery scott character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: The Motion Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3331522841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0OTI2YWItMDllZi00ZWZlLTlkZDgtZmU2M2QxNDVkYWRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0OTI2YWItMDllZi00ZWZlLTlkZDgtZmU2M2QxNDVkYWRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000638/","name":"William Shatner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000559/","name":"Leonard Nimoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001420/","name":"DeForest Kelley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936404/","name":"Robert Wise"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006081/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024434/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515245/","name":"Harold Livingston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0287669/","name":"Alan Dean Foster"}],"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Kirk resumes command of the overhauled USS Enterprise in order to intercept it.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0079945/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"bkoganbing","dateCreated":"2010-12-29","inLanguage":"English","name":"It's Continuing Mission","reviewBody":"Star Trek: The Motion Picture has its unique place in cinema history as probably the first television series to get a big screen motion picture. Completely due to its special fan base, the like of which has never been seen before or since.\n\nIn order to keep the phenomenon going Gene Roddenberry knew he had to have something special to offer and he did. The continuity from the television series was accomplished effortlessly, in fact one of the new characters Commander William Decker is the son of William Windom who was another starship captain in an episode. More I can't say less I give the plot away.\n\nIn fact Decker played by Stephen Collins would be commanding the newly fitted Enterprise if it were on a routine mission. But with the threat of an immense alien being on a direct path to earth now Admiral James T. Kirk takes command of the starship himself and with Decker reunites all the old crew from the TV series to meet the threat.\n\nFans of the original series will also see the similarities in plot between another episode involving the Enterprise meeting up with an old space probe that now has taken on some new functions. The same idea forms the basis of this film's story although in every way it has been expanded and a new ending conceived. Here's a hint, a budding relationship between Collins and new ship's lieutenant Persis Khambatta is what ultimately saves the earth.\n\nJust as you remember them William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, and Walter Koenig are all back and completely in character as you remember them. The new people Collins, Khambatta and the rest are integrated nicely into the story.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture received three Academy Award nominations, for Best Art&amp;Set Direction, Best Visual Effects, and Best Musical Score. The special effects never overwhelm the telling of a good story which is the primary mission and best asset of the original television series and its successors. \n\nIf you're not a Trekkie before seeing this film, you may be come one upon viewing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Adventure","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1979-12-08","keywords":"alien,voyager spacecraft,transporter malfunction,leonard mccoy character,montgomery scott character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: The Motion Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3331522841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0OTI2YWItMDllZi00ZWZlLTlkZDgtZmU2M2QxNDVkYWRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0OTI2YWItMDllZi00ZWZlLTlkZDgtZmU2M2QxNDVkYWRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000638/","name":"William Shatner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000559/","name":"Leonard Nimoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001420/","name":"DeForest Kelley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936404/","name":"Robert Wise"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024434/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515245/","name":"Harold Livingston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0287669/","name":"Alan Dean Foster"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Chris Pine (you might have seen him in a little movie called "Star Trek" by J.J. Abrams) &amp; Piper Perabo star in a very low key Horror movie, that doesn't even try to make you believe it has any big action scenes in it.

And the movie which is basically a children's vehicle for rapper/actor/producer Ice Cube who is starring in "Are We There Yet?" is not worth the ride nor the price of admission. Too bad for Ice Cube though. He is a winning presence with an appealing deadpan comic shtick in the "Friday",and "Barbershop" movies as well as here,but he is hampered by the subpar work of the writers who are totally responsible for this mayhem of family dysfunctional values. Here he is not only muggin the camera at its worst,it is also the most pathetic display of sympathy by a actor in recent months. Here is what the producers did here. First they bring on two of the stars from the first original "Friday" movie(Ice Cube and a suddenly aged Nia Long),and put them in a film that is supposed to be family oriented material,since the film uses every cliché from several films to bring this to the point of ridiculous mayhem. From there,they bring on two of the most misbehaving,obnoxious kids ever to sully the screen,exhibiting misbehavior to such an extreme that it goes beyond the point of normality which to say goes way beneath rude and disrespectful. Still it is a shame that Ice Cube chose this clunker of a vehicle for his first-ever family film. It could have been a whole lot better if Cube brought along his protégé from the first "Friday" film as one of the kids uncles,you know like Chris Tucker? It could have made this film a lot more entertaining."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30987,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-05-25","keywords":"braces,fish out of water,child gagged,reference to lebron james,reference to 50 cent","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Are We There Yet?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991704857","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000505/","name":"Nia Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020248/","name":"Aleisha Allen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505152/","name":"Brian Levant"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044714/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027958/","name":"Steven Gary Banks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257282/","name":"Claudia Grazioso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

And the movie which is basically a children's vehicle for rapper/actor/producer Ice Cube who is starring in "Are We There Yet?" is not worth the ride nor the price of admission. Too bad for Ice Cube though. He is a winning presence with an appealing deadpan comic shtick in the "Friday",and "Barbershop" movies as well as here,but he is hampered by the subpar work of the writers who are totally responsible for this mayhem of family dysfunctional values. Here he is not only muggin the camera at its worst,it is also the most pathetic display of sympathy by a actor in recent months. Here is what the producers did here. First they bring on two of the stars from the first original "Friday" movie(Ice Cube and a suddenly aged Nia Long),and put them in a film that is supposed to be family oriented material,since the film uses every cliché from several films to bring this to the point of ridiculous mayhem. From there,they bring on two of the most misbehaving,obnoxious kids ever to sully the screen,exhibiting misbehavior to such an extreme that it goes beyond the point of normality which to say goes way beneath rude and disrespectful. Still it is a shame that Ice Cube chose this clunker of a vehicle for his first-ever family film. It could have been a whole lot better if Cube brought along his protégé from the first "Friday" film as one of the kids uncles,you know like Chris Tucker? It could have made this film a lot more entertaining.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30987,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-05-25","keywords":"braces,fish out of water,child gagged,reference to lebron james,reference to 50 cent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Are We There Yet?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991704857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000505/","name":"Nia Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020248/","name":"Aleisha Allen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505152/","name":"Brian Levant"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044714/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027958/","name":"Steven Gary Banks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257282/","name":"Claudia Grazioso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

The action twists and turns, the characters may or may not be what they seem to be, and crosses follow double-crosses. Thus, there is little time for the viewer to be bored or to ponder the implausibility of it all. But, in a sleek glossy film such as this one, logic is not a key factor, it's the look and the action that count, and both of those attributes, especially the look, make "Entrapment" an entertaining film. Sean Connery, who plays an aging master thief, can anchor any film that he appears in, and this one is no exception. His presence alone grounds the movie and nearly makes the implausible plausible. However, while Connery is one of a handful of men who have retained their looks and masculine appeal beyond middle age, the likelihood that the luscious Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is at the peak of her beauty here, would fall for him tests the bounds of credibility. Perhaps the romance was written in as a fantasy for us near-codgers and to give us hope. Besides the excellent cinematography of the human scenery, which also includes the dependable Will Patton and Ving Rhames, the lush photography of the Scottish Highlands offers an unsolicited advertisement for the Scottish National Tourist Board. If rooms were available in the luxurious castle that Connery uses in the film, this would have been written there.\n\nThus, "Entrapment" seems to have everything: beautiful people, solid performances, breathtaking scenery, suspense, and excitement. There is definitely enough here to entertain a not-too-discriminating viewer for two hours. Of course, afterward, one might ponder why all of the expensive high-tech security systems that are depicted in the film quickly fall victim to a pair of thieves who seem more amused with themselves than intense and focused when they are stealing such incredible sums of money. If theft were as easy and casual as Connery and Zeta-Jones make it seem to be, we could all have a lot more fun in life plotting and executing heists instead of commuting and staring at computer monitors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112016,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"1999-04-30","keywords":"art,art thief,master thief,sexual tension,heist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Entrapment","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1789198617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ1NzA2OWUtZDc3OC00OGM1LWFmZTAtNmM2NzEyYTA0Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ1NzA2OWUtZDc3OC00OGM1LWFmZTAtNmM2NzEyYTA0Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000750/","name":"Jon Amiel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103746/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0060103/","name":"Ronald Bass"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381110/","name":"Michael Hertzberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115310/","name":"William Broyles Jr."}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie captures that whimsy and is very entertaining, as a result. It begins rather mundanely - on purpose - during a standard science fiction convention, in which several actors, whose careers nosedived after starring in a canceled sci-fi TV show, are relegated to these cheesy appearances, signing autographs and hiding their disgust at what they've been reduced to. Well, except Tim Allen, who starts off very cheery until he has some ice water thrown in his face, a surprisingly effective moment. All the actors playing the actors fill out their roles very well. Tim Allen used to be the Capt.Kirk-type commander on the TV show; Weaver played his communications officer, like Uhura, and always repeated computer statements; Rickman was the alien doctor; Shalhoub was the Scotty-like tech man below decks; Mitchell was the pilot, like Sulu. Rockwell ends up along for the ride, even though he only appeared in one episode, as an expendable crewman.\n\nWhen everything shifts, about 20 minutes in, it's not very subtle. All of a sudden, these has-been actors are thrust into a very real galactic adventure. It's kind of a jaw-dropping scene, meant to inspire awe, and, at the same time, the humor is quite clever and thought out. The actors' reactions when they're first transported over several light years are priceless. And, even in already good moments like these, the filmmakers throw in an extra little slice of comedy, as one of the actors does not react as expected. Rickman stands out a bit as the huffy British actor, showing exasperation in almost every scene he's in, but it's never tiresome. Weaver &amp; Allen exceed expectations, however; we're not used to seeing them in roles such as this. Allen is known for comedy, but here he's expected to draw out a character with a long history as a pretentious, sometimes failed actor, and he succeeds nicely. Rockwell nails the role of the nervous 3rd-stringer, a throwaway part usually, which he somehow manages to use to steal a scene or two. And Shalhoub, who we're used to being interesting by now, is very much so as the somewhat oddly serene member of the group. But the biggest surprises are Mitchell &amp; Colantoni, whom I was unfamiliar with; Mitchell is terrifically funny attempting to navigate the real starship, while Colantoni offers the most unique interpretation of how a real alien would act &amp; speak.\n\nThere was obvious tinkering just before release of this movie to avoid a harsher rating or reduce the length, but these changes could not remove the charm of this sci-fi parody. And, simply labeling it parody may not do it justice. I think only those Trekkers who regard Star Trek as their personal religion may be offended by it; otherwise, any Trek fan should applaud this as mostly a tribute to such entertaining TV shows, recognizing all the little reminders of what made them such great shows. The theme of tolerance, for example, is represented by the strangely different but similar-to-us aliens who the audience cannot help but grow very fond of by the end of the story. On top of that, the so-called sci-fi geek fans, usually the object of scorn, are made the heroes by the end of the film. Everyone has their value in such a universe.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":157465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1999-12-25","keywords":"parody,sexy woman,alien,actor,fanboy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2790177561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxMTI2OTUtNTg4NC00NTFmLThiY2ItOTdjNjA5OGI1OWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxMTI2OTUtNTg4NC00NTFmLThiY2ItOTdjNjA5OGI1OWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000741/","name":"Tim Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000244/","name":"Sigourney Weaver"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000614/","name":"Alan Rickman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661751/","name":"Dean Parisot"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071947/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0397232/","name":"David Howard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330565/","name":"Robert Gordon"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie captures that whimsy and is very entertaining, as a result. It begins rather mundanely - on purpose - during a standard science fiction convention, in which several actors, whose careers nosedived after starring in a canceled sci-fi TV show, are relegated to these cheesy appearances, signing autographs and hiding their disgust at what they've been reduced to.

Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along.

STOP, read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.\n\nThis was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously   AND   it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them   you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.\n\nSiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.\n\nOverall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film   the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"football","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shaolin Soccer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550542873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955505/","name":"Wei Zhao"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939431/","name":"Yat-Fei Wong"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0302241/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032768/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298676/","name":"Min-Hun Fung"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":318968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The mall is now closing forever.."","reviewBody":"How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.\n\nThe movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.\n\nSeeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.\n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.\n\nAs Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.\n\nRhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.\n\nFirst time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.\n\nThe horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.\n\nAll to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'\n\nHowever, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.\n\nIt's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.\n\nIt's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.\n\nGood acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.\n\n8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":246662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror"],"datePublished":"2004-06-02","keywords":"survival horror,mall,nurse,shopping mall,zombie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Zack Snyder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1692647449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"From 'Dawn of the Dead' and '300' to 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' and 'Army of the Dead,' we break down the stunning visual trademarks of director Zack Snyder."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001631/","name":"Sarah Polley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001616/","name":"Mekhi Phifer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086710/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010962/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013658/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

David Giuntoli and Danny Bruno are AWESOME!!!!!!! The special effects are amazing. We like the autopsy scenes too even though pretty gruesome! It's way cool! I hope that NBC does the smart thing and keeps this one going... It's certainly a HIT in our house.

Even though Leigh Whannel (spelling might be wrong) Doesn't act that well, you can see his fear, along with everyone else's. Not the most gruesome of the series. The twist at the end is one you didn't know to begin with but then you're like "omg totally makes sense now". This series is a fun one to watch, all the blood and gore. It is a classic among horror films.

"Die Fälscher" is a well-made and touching movie about the Holocaust and a special division of Jews in a concentration camp that survived by counterfeiting money (or pretending to do so) for the Nazis. Karl Markovics is the shining light of the cast. Who thought that the guy who came to greater popularity by starring in "Kommissar Rex" would end up getting roles like this one and playing them to perfection? August Diehl is good, too, but he comes across as a bit too dramatic at times. The Nazis - and that's the only weakness of Stefan Ruzowitzky's movie - are the way they always are. Ruthless, cruel, craven and at the same time stupid pigs who do everything to humiliate the Jews at any time. Even though, that is probably the way 99% of them really were, it would have been more interesting to get a differentiated view on some of them.\n\nWhile "Die Fälscher" may not reinvent the wheel, it is a pretty great movie. And although it's typical that Hollywood would pick only a Holocaust-story from Austria as an Oscar contender, it is exciting as hell for a movie from this country to get a nomination. I really hope that Stefan Ruzowitzky will get the award, because his movie deserves it and it could help the Austrian film industry to finally get momentum again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44669,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2007-03-22","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,pubic hair,inmate,nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Counterfeiters","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2364539161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThmZDg1N2EtNmY5YS00NmNlLWFkZDAtNmRkM2E3MzIxYWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThmZDg1N2EtNmY5YS00NmNlLWFkZDAtNmRkM2E3MzIxYWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548686/","name":"Karl Markovics","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225944/","name":"August Diehl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0834479/","name":"Devid Striesow"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752328/","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002528/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0128215/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2542195/","name":"Adolf Burger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752328/","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The third in a series is typically still worse. Not so here. Each of these three films tells a different story - even though the characters that appear in two or in all three have consequently the same attitudes and lifestyles as before. In this third film in the series we have local politics: elections of the mayor of the town and of the town council will take place soon. The current mayor and his strong opponent both are seeking the support of the local Catholic priest: there is also an Orthodox church with a priest. The Catholic priest handles these situations in his unique way.\n\nThe actors are very good. Those playing the police chief and the Catholic priest we have seen before, they are as good as before, although before the first film in this series their experience was limited to providing voices in a marionette theater in Bialystok. The girl in the bank who fights off her admirers with "I am Orthodox" clearly has shining talent. The actor playing Stasio back-home-after-20-years-in-the US is a good addition, not seen in previous films. Emilian Kaminski who made his strong appearance in the second film as Jerzy Bocian is very good here also. In spite of these other good actors, in my opinion the show is stolen by Agnieszka Kotlarska who plays the policewoman Marina Chmiel. She provides feel- good moments, as in the scene when she is asked where her unusual first name comes from; she replies: "My parents liked a song that begins with that name". Actually, her role is quite difficult. Marina has a black belt in karate &amp; functions well in combat-like situations. However, in ordinary situations she is quite shy, with men in particular. Talking to men, she sometimes falls into the area comfortable to her, like in the street scene in which she is telling the young policeman Marian about martial arts. When that topic of conversation is not possible, her shyness seems to overwhelm her; wonderfully played. Her sudden feeling for Stasio - after she has rescued him from thugs - is received by the viewer as quite natural &amp; fits well with her character. \n\nOur DVD has voices in Polish with subtitles in English and French.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-06-19","keywords":"village priest,provincial life,mayor,elections,marriage proposal","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0246198/","name":"Krzysztof Dzierma"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0067329/","name":"Andrzej Beja-Zaborski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2028804/","name":"Wojciech Solarz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013835/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
