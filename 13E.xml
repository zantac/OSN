But unfortunately the scenes of their awkwardness go on forever and the quite nice music in the background, rather than making it more important, just seems to be pushing it. This movie needed a lot more substance or a lot sharper editing ... or maybe a different director. Maybe the moral is that the author (here Ian McEwan, whose work I like a lot) shouldn't be allowed to write the screenplay. Not an unpleasant way to spend a couple of hours, but I really hope that Saoirse takes on meatier roles.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-05-18","keywords":"honeymoon,fear of intimacy,year 1962,wedding night,chamber music","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1060223001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNlYjZiNjEtYzFjNS00ZWNlLWFhOTYtOGM1ZDZkZGE3MzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNlYjZiNjEtYzFjNS00ZWNlLWFhOTYtOGM1ZDZkZGE3MzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"In England, 1962, a young couple finds their idyllic romance colliding with issues of sexual freedom and societal pressure, leading to an awkward and fateful wedding night."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6247071/","name":"Billy Howle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9241204/","name":"Andy Burse"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4315078/","name":"Dominic Cooke"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0116615/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0784444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But unfortunately the scenes of their awkwardness go on forever and the quite nice music in the background, rather than making it more important, just seems to be pushing it. This movie needed a lot more substance or a lot sharper editing ... or maybe a different director. Maybe the moral is that the author (here Ian McEwan, whose work I like a lot) shouldn't be allowed to write the screenplay. Not an unpleasant way to spend a couple of hours, but I really hope that Saoirse takes on meatier roles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-05-18","keywords":"honeymoon,fear of intimacy,year 1962,wedding night,chamber music","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1060223001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNlYjZiNjEtYzFjNS00ZWNlLWFhOTYtOGM1ZDZkZGE3MzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNlYjZiNjEtYzFjNS00ZWNlLWFhOTYtOGM1ZDZkZGE3MzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"In England, 1962, a young couple finds their idyllic romance colliding with issues of sexual freedom and societal pressure, leading to an awkward and fateful wedding night.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6247071/","name":"Billy Howle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9241204/","name":"Andy Burse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4315078/","name":"Dominic Cooke"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0116615/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0784444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That and that it was another film seen as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible were my main reasons in seeing 'Under the Tree' from Icelandic director Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson. \n\n'Under the Tree' is a truly fine film and manages to take a relevant subject (feuding neighbours) and explore it in a way that was hilarious, shocking and moving. It won't be one of my favourite films any time soon, but in no way should it be overlooked and should be seen as an example of how to execute a film with a subject like this well. Sadly, 'Under the Tree' has been released here alongside more expensive in budget films that have been quite big box office successes and films that people are more likely to go and see. While having enjoyed many of the films in question (in no way is it intended to be knock), 'Under the Tree' is better than most of them and deserves better.\n\nSure 'Under the Tree' is occasionally a touch overcooked and some may find some of the behaviours extreme. \n\nHowever, Sigurdsson directs with a perfect balance of hilarious mayhem and melancholic pathos. This is also reflected in the thought-provoking script he scripted with Huldar Breidfjord. Many parts are hilarious in a dark way, others genuinely shock and there are emotional parts too, all in a way that is kept plausible throughout. Neighbour feuding sounds insignificant on paper to some, but 'Under the Tree' makes it darkly funny, disturbing and melancholic, a not easy feat but beautifully done here.\n\nThe storytelling is always compelling, with the tensions having a bleakness and ferocity while still entertaining and emotionally resonating. There is a good deal happening, but not in a way that it feels cluttered with too many characters and subplots, instead there is enough breathing space and depth while having an alertness to the drama. \n\nA good cast would be needed to bring all this life. Luckily, 'Under the Tree's' cast is excellent. Particularly note-worthy of a cast where everybody is good and nobody bad is Edda Bjorgvinsdottir on fiercely intense form, her character near-unhinged. \n\nIt is a very well made film visually, beautifully shot in particular.

She is a successful horse breeder and her life is beautiful in a simple way, her corner of the world as stunning as it is remote. But with the arrival of her grandson a dark suspicion creeps in. Will Muriel be able to take a stand against the imminent danger to her grandson? And what does it mean to truly save someone?\n\nThe grim reality of radicalised youngsters in France is showcased in an unlikely surrounding. The French countryside seems to be the furthest place from the raging Syrian war, but the evil spreads its tentacles everywhere. The radicalised Muslims are shown in unflinchingly brutal way although it's never a secret that the kids who found themselves in this situation are out of their depth.

She is a successful horse breeder and her life is beautiful in a simple way, her corner of the world as stunning as it is remote. But with the arrival of her grandson a dark suspicion creeps in. Will Muriel be able to take a stand against the imminent danger to her grandson? And what does it mean to truly save someone?\n\nThe grim reality of radicalised youngsters in France is showcased in an unlikely surrounding. The French countryside seems to be the furthest place from the raging Syrian war, but the evil spreads its tentacles everywhere. The radicalised Muslims are shown in unflinchingly brutal way although it's never a secret that the kids who found themselves in this situation are out of their depth. Without prejudice the movie delivers both sides of the argument, showcasing how exactly one can become brainwashed in a modern unreliable world with no real values.\n\nCatherine Deneuve is marvellous in the film, looking stunning at the age of 77.

I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation. Which could be caused by a lot of things but is most likely the result of trimming in post-production, in which important unifying elements were left on the cutting room floor. Or it could be that the director and production designer just failed to translate the writer's vision onto the screen.\n\nSince this ultimately this is a story about an evil character who develops a sentimental side, it is absolutely critical that this process is communicated to the audience. The audience should not just be surprised by the ending but should be able to think back and see all the motivational pieces click into place. In this regard the movie is a complete failure.\n\nThen there is the issue of cheating. Because we only know what he wants to tell us, a director has a variety of legit ways to introduce misdirection and surprise into a film. But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy (Chazz Palminteri). It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.\n\nWhatever, it means that the only reason to watch this version of "Diabolique" is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hard-as-nails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.\n\nIf you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original "Diabolique", track down 1971's "Let's Scare Jessica To Death". This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's "Diabolique", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental "institution" who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area. The odd locals and their local legends begin to mess with Jessica's head as her husband and his secret girlfriend attempt to scare her to death.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14109,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

"Polar Opposites" strength does NOT come from million dollar fx, or performances by academy-award-winning actors. The thing that makes this low-budget independent film so engaging is the story and the relationships that develop while the story world unravels on screen.\n\nAt its simplest, "Polar Opposites" spins a tale about a possible global disaster set in motion by a nuclear blast, and how a scientist is called upon to save the day. The scientific theories proposed by the story are chillingly accurate, and they are what hooked me initially. It's refreshing to see science-fact made understandable and yes, entertaining (the tangerine/battery visual was funny). But the film goes beyond simply laying out facts and ideas to tell the story. It puts together a group of characters that have real issues in dealing with the problem, and with each other. There is a father/son relationship (Charles Shaunessy and Clive Revill) that is touching and real, funny and even corny at times. Tracey Nelson and Kieren Hutchinson play doctors coping with the crisis, but they still have a playful side to their relationship. And the actor playing their patient, Al (Ismael Carlo), is both unsettling and tender.\n\nIn the end, the disaster unfolds like it might in any other disaster flick (although, as I mentioned, without the huge big budget fx). But the story and the characters were the ingredient that actually made the film quite enjoyable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-06-06","keywords":"nuclear test,friendship,scientist,writer,earthquake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Deadly Shift","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi887948825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ4NDlhODktN2NlMy00YTY3LWE3MjItY2ZmMjkyMWUyODUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ4NDlhODktN2NlMy00YTY3LWE3MjItY2ZmMjkyMWUyODUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Ground Zero: The Deady Shift aka Polar Opposites"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0789478/","name":"Charles Shaughnessy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625796/","name":"Tracy Nelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1757373/","name":"Ken Barnett"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0676248/","name":"Fred Olen Ray"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167713/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0563701/","name":"Paolo Mazzucato"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Polar Opposites" strength does NOT come from million dollar fx, or performances by academy-award-winning actors. The thing that makes this low-budget independent film so engaging is the story and the relationships that develop while the story world unravels on screen.\n\nAt its simplest, "Polar Opposites" spins a tale about a possible global disaster set in motion by a nuclear blast, and how a scientist is called upon to save the day. The scientific theories proposed by the story are chillingly accurate, and they are what hooked me initially. It's refreshing to see science-fact made understandable and yes, entertaining (the tangerine/battery visual was funny). But the film goes beyond simply laying out facts and ideas to tell the story. It puts together a group of characters that have real issues in dealing with the problem, and with each other. There is a father/son relationship (Charles Shaunessy and Clive Revill) that is touching and real, funny and even corny at times. Tracey Nelson and Kieren Hutchinson play doctors coping with the crisis, but they still have a playful side to their relationship. And the actor playing their patient, Al (Ismael Carlo), is both unsettling and tender.\n\nIn the end, the disaster unfolds like it might in any other disaster flick (although, as I mentioned, without the huge big budget fx). But the story and the characters were the ingredient that actually made the film quite enjoyable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-06-06","keywords":"nuclear test,friendship,scientist,writer,earthquake","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Deadly Shift","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi887948825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ4NDlhODktN2NlMy00YTY3LWE3MjItY2ZmMjkyMWUyODUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ4NDlhODktN2NlMy00YTY3LWE3MjItY2ZmMjkyMWUyODUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Ground Zero: The Deady Shift aka Polar Opposites","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0789478/","name":"Charles Shaughnessy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625796/","name":"Tracy Nelson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1757373/","name":"Ken Barnett"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0676248/","name":"Fred Olen Ray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167713/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0563701/","name":"Paolo Mazzucato"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The worst part of the movie was the music. For some reason they found it necessary between scenes to return to the same droll song over and over again. The action in this movie was nonexistent, as was the interaction between characters. Mario van Peebles was casted as a French bad guy. This was by far the worst French accent I have ever heard. Rob Lowe was a junkie and played that very well. The rest of the actors weren't noteworthy. All in all, this movie falls into Top 5 bad movies of all time. I've seen B movies (Caged Heat, USA Up All Night, etc.) that had a better plot and acting.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1623,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime"],"keywords":"shootout,dog,gangster,american abroad,drug addict","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crazy Six","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1447274009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlmNGIyY2YtNTg5OS00ZTU4LWJhMzgtNTNhMTliY2RjZGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlmNGIyY2YtNTg5OS00ZTU4LWJhMzgtNTNhMTliY2RjZGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sterling Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000507/","name":"Rob Lowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005522/","name":"Mario Van Peebles"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089502/","name":"Albert Pyun"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009633/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013199/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0950724/","name":"Galen Yuen"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is the same studio that has made a living producing small budget films to the urban community like Obsessed, No Good Deed, and When the Bough Breaks. While they have all maintained solid profitability, I have found all of their filmmaking and writing severely lacking any thrills and under utilizing their lead actors. So I found myself walking into Proud Mary expecting a familiar feeling, but a slight sense of naive optimism.\n\nMary (Taraji P. Henson) plays a hitman who learns she kills the parent of a young boy during a assigned hit. Over the year, she oversees his wellness and takes him in and notices the strain it brings between her and her higher up (Danny Glover) and her previous lover (Billy Brown).\n\nWhile some of the films budget limits can be seen, the film is able to bring some decent performances from Billy Brown and some decent "gun-fu" action. The finale has a fleeting moment of some engaging action, but it feels all too brief and too dimly lit to take in the stunt's Taraji did. There are fleeting moments when the film is able to not take itself so seriously, particularly one scene when the credits begin to roll which I wish the film committed itself to that certain feeling more often.\n\nWhile I am not surprised the boss subplot is irrelevant, it still amazes me how little we know about Mary as a character. Her backstory is almost inexistent, which is bothersome given she's such a motherly character but still feels too locked to her own thoughts. The villain's also have no gravitas, as they never physically challenge Mary and feel like faceless dummies to show off Taraji's fighting abilities. And the little boy can be very annoying and all over the place at times. One moment he plays as a hardened street kid and the next a whiny child.\n\nProud Mary thankfully isn't the disaster I was worried it would be, but it's not as committed to the over the top action I wished it was.

Mary is a hit woman working for an organized crime family in Boston, whose life is completely turned around when she meets a young boy whose path she crosses when a professional hit goes bad." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt6421110/","name":"Proud Mary","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MjI3MDU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYwMTkxNDM@._V1_.jpg","description":"Mary is a hit woman working for an organized crime family in Boston, whose life is completely turned around when she meets a young boy whose path she crosses when a professional hit goes bad.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt6421110/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"travishouze","dateCreated":"2018-01-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"I Wish "Mary" Came To the Fight With a Fully Loaded Clip","reviewBody":"By this time, we all know what to expect from a Screen Gems Movie. This is the same studio that has made a living producing small budget films to the urban community like Obsessed, No Good Deed, and When the Bough Breaks. While they have all maintained solid profitability, I have found all of their filmmaking and writing severely lacking any thrills and under utilizing their lead actors. So I found myself walking into Proud Mary expecting a familiar feeling, but a slight sense of naive optimism.\n\nMary (Taraji P. Henson) plays a hitman who learns she kills the parent of a young boy during a assigned hit. Over the year, she oversees his wellness and takes him in and notices the strain it brings between her and her higher up (Danny Glover) and her previous lover (Billy Brown).\n\nWhile some of the films budget limits can be seen, the film is able to bring some decent performances from Billy Brown and some decent "gun-fu" action. The finale has a fleeting moment of some engaging action, but it feels all too brief and too dimly lit to take in the stunt's Taraji did. There are fleeting moments when the film is able to not take itself so seriously, particularly one scene when the credits begin to roll which I wish the film committed itself to that certain feeling more often.\n\nWhile I am not surprised the boss subplot is irrelevant, it still amazes me how little we know about Mary as a character. Her backstory is almost inexistent, which is bothersome given she's such a motherly character but still feels too locked to her own thoughts. The villain's also have no gravitas, as they never physically challenge Mary and feel like faceless dummies to show off Taraji's fighting abilities. And the little boy can be very annoying and all over the place at times. One moment he plays as a hardened street kid and the next a whiny child.\n\nProud Mary thankfully isn't the disaster I was worried it would be, but it's not as committed to the over the top action I wished it was. While the mother-son dynamic allows for a softer criminal, the emotional impact doesn't feel earned. The 70s music choices are on the nose at times, but loosens up the film at points. To put it simply, Proud Mary comes to the fight strapped with a half empty clip.\n\nRating: 5.0/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9663,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-12","keywords":"hitwoman,woman boy relationship,silencer,assassin,reloading a gun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1926150425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRmMWQ2MTctYzcwYS00MTQ0LWJiMDItMGMyMTBkY2Y2NzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2ODc0MjY@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRmMWQ2MTctYzcwYS00MTQ0LWJiMDItMGMyMTBkY2Y2NzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2ODc0MjY@._V1_.jpg","description":"An assassin meets a young boy who sparks her maternal instinct.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378245/","name":"Taraji P.

You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.","reviewBody":"No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- "The Pursuit of Happiness" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.\n\nThe great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me." But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.\n\nThis film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.\n\nIn short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting. Leaves you thinking about it for days!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-02-07","keywords":"motivational,passion,hardwork,hare krishna,american dream","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pursuit of Happyness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1413719065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1535523/","name":"Jaden Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610831/","name":"Gabriele Muccino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0175726/","name":"Steve Conrad"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.","reviewBody":"No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- "The Pursuit of Happiness" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.\n\nThe great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me." But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.\n\nThis film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.\n\nIn short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting. Leaves you thinking about it for days!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-02-07","keywords":"motivational,passion,hardwork,hare krishna,american dream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pursuit of Happyness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1413719065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1535523/","name":"Jaden Smith"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610831/","name":"Gabriele Muccino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0175726/","name":"Steve Conrad"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kevin Costner takes the title role and proves to be handsome enough and swashbuckling enough to do justice to the role during the action scenes. However, during the film's quieter moments, Costner's American accent grates a little amid the Sherwood Forest surroundings.\n\n The story doesn't particularly need explaining, but for people who have lived on Mars for their whole lives here it is. Robin of Locksley, a young soldier, returns from the Crusades to find the city of Nottingham and its surrounding area terrorised by the evil Sherrif of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Robin takes refuge in the nearby Sherwood Forest, where he gathers a band of woodland outlaws who are always stealing money and treasure taken by the Sherrif and giving it back to the poor. His dashing antics impress Maid Marian (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio), a childhood friend, and he quickly becomes popular with the poor and honest folk who nickname him Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves.\n\n The film is very old-fashioned, but it occasionally gives away its 1991 release status with modern touches (the fancy camera-work in which the camera is seemingly fixed upon an arrow as it is fired at a target; the introduction of a Moorish warrior character [Morgan Freeman] to broaden the film's cultural reference; Rickman's self-deprecating pantomimic turn as the wicked Sherrif). On the whole, it is an entertaining film with a good balance between the action and the romance. The best performance - surprisingly - comes from Michael Wincott who oozes menace as the Sherrif's despicable cousin Guy of Gisbourne. There are some quite significant factual errors, the best (by "best" I mean "funniest") of which is when Robin and his Moorish companion stand at the foot of the white cliffs of Dover and Robin tells him: "by nightfall we will dine with my father!"

The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.\n\nTurkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.\n\n"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.

The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.\n\nTurkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.\n\n"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel "Snatch" is stylistically very similar to "Lock, Stock ":  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think "Very Bad Things").  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.\n\n Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness.

The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.\n\nTurkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.\n\n"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel "Snatch" is stylistically very similar to "Lock, Stock ":  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.

The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.\n\nTurkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.\n\n"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel "Snatch" is stylistically very similar to "Lock, Stock ":  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think "Very Bad Things").  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.\n\n Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad Pitt\n\nPitt resurrects his trailer trash look from "Kalifornia" and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend's Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O'Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and part-time pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.\n\nWhile "Snatch" initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchie's earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":820877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-09-01","keywords":"diamond,boxer,narrated by character,fight,boxing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Snatch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1558577433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334318/","name":"Stephen Graham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Acting, camera work, jokes, and banter between coworkers, all served to create a believable environment. And that dark past of his, just waiting to be revealed and possibly destroy everything, hovers in the background, creating tension. I find myself waiting for the next episode. One reviewer complains about there being a personal story behind the main character, but that's how we end up finding out about that mysterious past of his. And, seriously, what do they want? A cardboard cutout character with minimal lines and no home life? The added drama keeps the show interesting, adds extra levels to the character as it goes, and family members are always potentially at risk when there's a hero character involved, so there's that. Give the show a chance and don't pay attention to bad reviews if you already think you might like something.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7057,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-03-09","keywords":"doctor,caucasian,latex gloves,forensic pathologist,dead body","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344435/","name":"Ioan Gruffudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0319696/","name":"Darren Gilshenan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0960946/","name":"Damien Garvey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110425/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207641/","name":"Stephen M.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

I consider it a bonus that it's the one thing on TV that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons. Even my father-in-law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences! I was delighted when I heard that there was a second series imminent.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced.

I want to compare both shows and see which one is better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77198,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-12","keywords":"corrupt cop,los angeles california,made for cable tv,mayor,drugs","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004821/","name":"Michael Chiklis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413052/","name":"Michael Jace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439813/","name":"Jay Karnes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086397/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0203234/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752841/","name":"Shawn Ryan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Shield: Season Seven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi425591577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home video trailer for the final season of this cop show"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Other good 90's slashers are of course Scream &amp; Scream 2,The Faculty, Halloween H20 &amp; Urban Legend these stood out as excellent well made slasher films &amp; are all great","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":141348,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1997-10-17","keywords":"stupid victim,taking a shower,mystery killer,characters murdered one by one,part of trilogy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"I Know What You Did Last Summer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi663666457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDBiYmQtZDJkNC00NjQxLTlkZWEtMzMyN2RkOTBkY2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDBiYmQtZDJkNC00NjQxLTlkZWEtMzMyN2RkOTBkY2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001349/","name":"Jennifer Love Hewitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001264/","name":"Sarah Michelle Gellar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000162/","name":"Anne Heche"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318947/","name":"Jim Gillespie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147895/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0242028/","name":"Lois Duncan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0932078/","name":"Kevin Williamson"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So, overall if you're looking for an excellent cops show, brutal, raw and almost perfect, this one is for you. Now, I'm going to watch The Wire. I want to compare both shows and see which one is better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77198,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-12","keywords":"corrupt cop,los angeles california,made for cable tv,mayor,drugs","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004821/","name":"Michael Chiklis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413052/","name":"Michael Jace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439813/","name":"Jay Karnes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086397/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0203234/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752841/","name":"Shawn Ryan"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Shield: Season Seven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi425591577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home video trailer for the final season of this cop show"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Punisher ended up being a much better movie than I was anticipating. I think it will please comic fans and action fans alike. I also think it will be accessible to mainstream audiences. Definitely check it out on the big screen. \n\nThe brilliance of this movie comes from the uneasy nature in which you spend your two hours riveted to the story.  Yes, I did say brilliance.  At first, you get that uneasy feeling as you watch the director set up a story which is pretty much common knowledge.  You know that Frank's wife and son are going to get it.  So, the exposition that sets up his love for his family and the tender moments they share are uneasy, sorrowful and touching.  After the Punisher revs up into full `Punishing' mode, you're uneasy at the way in which he is dispatching villain after villain.  I was squirming in my chair and I wasn't the only one in the theatre doing so.  Sure it's violent but it borders on sadistic violence.  What's makes you the most uneasy is the fact that you are actually enjoying the carnage. These guys are so vile and are so deserving of their `Punishment' but you still have guilt to go along with the pleasure of seeing Frank really cut loose.  If you've seen The Punisher trailer then you see an image of him firing an arrow.  You have NO idea where that arrow ends up but boy, that must have hurt.  The one thing you don't have to worry about with this film is if the villain will get his.  I hate movies that go so far to develop a villain as truly evil by having him do despicable things after despicable things but have his demise be quick at movies end.  Well, you will feel sorry for Travolta's character at the end of this film and he does some very horrible things himself during the duration of this movie.  Overall, this film is an emotional journey that will make you squirm.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2819924, Title: Candice Renoir, 
 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  \n\nThis is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).\n\nIn conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too.

However, this only lasts 15 minutes, and from there the movie stops being a Scooby Doo movie and starts being a superhero movie, with Dick Dastardly as the supervillain, and Blue Falcon and his gang as superheroes, with the Scooby gang stuck there in a movie that is not their own.\n\nBecause let's face it, just like in a James Bond movie we have certain expectations, in a Scoob movie we also have expectations, and they are not met. That distinctive type of adventures where they explore a haunted location and, after many scares, end up discovering that it was all a not supernatural trick by some criminal, is not here, except for a brief nod at the beginning. Instead, we get a generic modern children's movie, with characters running around from chase to chase, battle to battle and explosion to explosion without a compelling plot, while making pop culture references. The plot involves saving the world from a large-scale supernatural threat (really supernatural, none of the subversion characteristic of the source material).\n\nSo, if we forget about wanting a Scooby Doo movie and focus on the movie we get, it's not very good either. You can see where they try to have jokes for the adult watchers, but they lack the wit and talent to make them funny. They occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a Scooby Doo movie, and they have traditional gags like having Scooby and Shaggy, in the middle of being chased by the critters, turn around and serve the critters as waiters, disconcerting them for a while, but it's too little and done without much talent. You also get a scene where two male characters fight and a female character says it's toxic masculinity, which is kind of a hateful message to send to children.\n\nIn short, if you want a Scooby movie, this is not it, and if you want a generic modern kid's movie, this is not a good one."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-05-15","keywords":"shared universe,scooby doo character,great dane,cartoon dog,dog","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2309144089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFmN2FkYTItODA3Ny00YzY5LWFmODEtNDlhZjE4YjgwY2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFmN2FkYTItODA3Ny00YzY5LWFmODEtNDlhZjE4YjgwY2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Mystery loves company.

However, this only lasts 15 minutes, and from there the movie stops being a Scooby Doo movie and starts being a superhero movie, with Dick Dastardly as the supervillain, and Blue Falcon and his gang as superheroes, with the Scooby gang stuck there in a movie that is not their own.\n\nBecause let's face it, just like in a James Bond movie we have certain expectations, in a Scoob movie we also have expectations, and they are not met. That distinctive type of adventures where they explore a haunted location and, after many scares, end up discovering that it was all a not supernatural trick by some criminal, is not here, except for a brief nod at the beginning. Instead, we get a generic modern children's movie, with characters running around from chase to chase, battle to battle and explosion to explosion without a compelling plot, while making pop culture references. The plot involves saving the world from a large-scale supernatural threat (really supernatural, none of the subversion characteristic of the source material).\n\nSo, if we forget about wanting a Scooby Doo movie and focus on the movie we get, it's not very good either. You can see where they try to have jokes for the adult watchers, but they lack the wit and talent to make them funny. They occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a Scooby Doo movie, and they have traditional gags like having Scooby and Shaggy, in the middle of being chased by the critters, turn around and serve the critters as waiters, disconcerting them for a while, but it's too little and done without much talent. You also get a scene where two male characters fight and a female character says it's toxic masculinity, which is kind of a hateful message to send to children.\n\nIn short, if you want a Scooby movie, this is not it, and if you want a generic modern kid's movie, this is not a good one.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-05-15","keywords":"shared universe,scooby doo character,great dane,cartoon dog,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2309144089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFmN2FkYTItODA3Ny00YzY5LWFmODEtNDlhZjE4YjgwY2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFmN2FkYTItODA3Ny00YzY5LWFmODEtNDlhZjE4YjgwY2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Mystery loves company.

Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.\n\nCrime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic `film noir' style, with its dark, brooding, cynical atmosphere. In `The Sting', however, George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised (as is the scenery), and the division of the film into sections with titles such as `The Hook' or `The Line' is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in black-and-white but in bright colour, and the mood, far from being heavy and brooding, is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin's music, although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set, fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly- Robert Shaw as the glowering, menacing Lonnegan, Robert Redford as the young, idealistic Hooker (insofar as a con-man can be said to be an idealist), and Paul Newman as the older, more experienced and laid-back Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.\n\nDespite the cheerful mood, the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as `heist' or `caper' movies, as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. `The Sting', however, is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt- Snyder, the one representative we see of the forces of law and order, is on Lonnegan's payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend's murder through the normal channels; the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet. An excellent film, which well deserved its Academy Award. 9/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1973-12-25","keywords":"con,con man,illegal activity,playing golf,con artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717122841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001351/","name":"George Roy Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911486/","name":"David S.

While it has the predictable white = bad, black = good thing happening, the story is actually new (to me, on film). Growing up, going through my first part-time jobs, I always ran into older people who unaccountably had the same responsibilities as I did. I didn't necessarily pity them, but I was curious about them. This film gives "that guy" some dimension, a life. I also like that the younger character can get in cross-ways with the law without being a thug. That's probably a lot more common than we know. It's not a story to change your life, but it is a thoughtful piece all the same.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-25","keywords":"food,f word,father son relationship,no opening credits","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3735339289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY4YzMyMDAtMTg3NS00NDUwLWEzMjItYTc2ODZiNGM4NmZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY4YzMyMDAtMTg3NS00NDUwLWEzMjItYTc2ODZiNGM4NmZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Stanley (Richard Jenkins), an aging fast-food worker, plans to call it quits after 38 years on the graveyard shift at Oscar's Chicken and Fish.

It is my second fave horror anthology(ABCs of Death just! beating it) and is a horror film I love very fondly. If you haven't seen it, see it!\n\nPart 2 was full of bad camera work, worse acting, and some of the most bonkers stuff you could think of to put on screen. It is a Z grade film, that gets everything so wrong on a technical level that it becomes oddly charming. In other words it is a pure so bad it's good and I find it hilarious. A lot of people hate it(and I can see why!) but I love it for much the same reason so many people like Troll 2.\n\nBut that of course asks, what kind of film would part 3 be? A cult classic social commentary dark horror film like the original, or a trash fire comedy miss step like part 2?\n\nWell part 3 feels very much like it was made in response to the bad feed back part 2 got. The film plays itself VERY safe. Only one of the four stories is even actually a commentary on racism. The rest could take place in any old anthology series. All the stories are a lot more down to Earth and much less over the top then anything was in part 2, or even the original. This does make the film pretty predictable. Since it is playing things so held back and safe you will be able to call out the plot twists well before they happen. A lot of people are going to complain that this film is very paint by numbers and formulaic.\n\nBUT along with playing things much more by the numbers the film makes itself much more competently. Camera work, good, acting good, pacing, good. Nothing is AMAZING! But there are no bad miss steps anywhere besides some weak CGI here and there. I do feel the one story about racism, the second one, is pretty darn good and feels like it would have been at home in the first film. The third story, though as said it could be from any horror anthology series, is still a good story that is well done and charming. It also has the first queer character for the series! Cool! :) The other two stories though predictable are by no means bad. So yes, this is an anthology with not a single bad story! Which is pretty good in my book.\n\nYa, you can nit pick it(the idea of this like six year old telling a grown man about a story where a man has sex with a blowup doll is pretty wonderfully absurd), but if you do you'll be just hating it for hating it sake.\n\nNo, this is a light going, turn your mind off, grab some Halloween candy with friends, kind of horror film. It's time killer, but very well done time killer and I think fans of the original will be over all pleased.\n\n6.8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"anthology,camera shot from inside a refrigerator,beaten to death,burned alive,gore","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8358598/","name":"Patrick Abellard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11051116/","name":"Frederick Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11086603/","name":"Djouliet Amara"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is my second fave horror anthology(ABCs of Death just! beating it) and is a horror film I love very fondly. If you haven't seen it, see it!\n\nPart 2 was full of bad camera work, worse acting, and some of the most bonkers stuff you could think of to put on screen. It is a Z grade film, that gets everything so wrong on a technical level that it becomes oddly charming. In other words it is a pure so bad it's good and I find it hilarious. A lot of people hate it(and I can see why!) but I love it for much the same reason so many people like Troll 2.\n\nBut that of course asks, what kind of film would part 3 be? A cult classic social commentary dark horror film like the original, or a trash fire comedy miss step like part 2?\n\nWell part 3 feels very much like it was made in response to the bad feed back part 2 got. The film plays itself VERY safe. Only one of the four stories is even actually a commentary on racism. The rest could take place in any old anthology series. All the stories are a lot more down to Earth and much less over the top then anything was in part 2, or even the original. This does make the film pretty predictable. Since it is playing things so held back and safe you will be able to call out the plot twists well before they happen. A lot of people are going to complain that this film is very paint by numbers and formulaic.\n\nBUT along with playing things much more by the numbers the film makes itself much more competently. Camera work, good, acting good, pacing, good. Nothing is AMAZING! But there are no bad miss steps anywhere besides some weak CGI here and there. I do feel the one story about racism, the second one, is pretty darn good and feels like it would have been at home in the first film. The third story, though as said it could be from any horror anthology series, is still a good story that is well done and charming. It also has the first queer character for the series! Cool! :) The other two stories though predictable are by no means bad. So yes, this is an anthology with not a single bad story! Which is pretty good in my book.\n\nYa, you can nit pick it(the idea of this like six year old telling a grown man about a story where a man has sex with a blowup doll is pretty wonderfully absurd), but if you do you'll be just hating it for hating it sake.\n\nNo, this is a light going, turn your mind off, grab some Halloween candy with friends, kind of horror film. It's time killer, but very well done time killer and I think fans of the original will be over all pleased.\n\n6.8 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"anthology,camera shot from inside a refrigerator,beaten to death,burned alive,gore","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8358598/","name":"Patrick Abellard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11051116/","name":"Frederick Allen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11086603/","name":"Djouliet Amara"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.\n\nCrime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic `film noir' style, with its dark, brooding, cynical atmosphere. In `The Sting', however, George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised (as is the scenery), and the division of the film into sections with titles such as `The Hook' or `The Line' is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in black-and-white but in bright colour, and the mood, far from being heavy and brooding, is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin's music, although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set, fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly- Robert Shaw as the glowering, menacing Lonnegan, Robert Redford as the young, idealistic Hooker (insofar as a con-man can be said to be an idealist), and Paul Newman as the older, more experienced and laid-back Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.\n\nDespite the cheerful mood, the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as `heist' or `caper' movies, as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. `The Sting', however, is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt- Snyder, the one representative we see of the forces of law and order, is on Lonnegan's payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend's murder through the normal channels; the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet.

This movie aims for there, but gets bogged in a swamp outside moscow.\n\nI wish i could file criminal charges against the production team because the way they managed to destroy such a captivating character should be criminal. Kretzsky, of course is who i am getting at. The potential setup of him was brilliant but it fizzled out into nothing. Then, about 3/4 of the movie in, his character gets a chance of redemption. And what does the movie do? Just absolutely nothing. If you do not get angered by how they threw away all their characters away you did not watch this movie.\n\nThe scenery was nice, the sets well made, the real life element capture was close to that of schindler's list. And that's all this movie has for it! All the raw emotion, personal struggle, complex relationships all the things they could have focused on in a movie about siberia (where NOTHING happens) they didnt. Instead it is just one scene of build up after another, then fizzle, then more of the same. No follow through, no culmination, no emotion.\n\nAt the end i couldn't care if any of them survived. The complete failure of this crew to attach the viewer to what should have been a sad tale of struggle cannot be forgiven.\n\nAnd to further insult us, of course the propaganda message before titles roll just had to be there, because let's face it. Unless you literally typed it on the screen, nobody would have grasped what this was even about. It was that bad.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6060,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"communism,deportation,soviet union,political repression,rape attempt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ashes in the Snow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi372423193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2525790/","name":"Bel Powley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2966840/","name":"Lisa Loven Kongsli"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909412/","name":"Martin Wallström"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2101256/","name":"Marius A.

This movie aims for there, but gets bogged in a swamp outside moscow.\n\nI wish i could file criminal charges against the production team because the way they managed to destroy such a captivating character should be criminal. Kretzsky, of course is who i am getting at. The potential setup of him was brilliant but it fizzled out into nothing. Then, about 3/4 of the movie in, his character gets a chance of redemption. And what does the movie do? Just absolutely nothing. If you do not get angered by how they threw away all their characters away you did not watch this movie.\n\nThe scenery was nice, the sets well made, the real life element capture was close to that of schindler's list. And that's all this movie has for it! All the raw emotion, personal struggle, complex relationships all the things they could have focused on in a movie about siberia (where NOTHING happens) they didnt. Instead it is just one scene of build up after another, then fizzle, then more of the same. No follow through, no culmination, no emotion.\n\nAt the end i couldn't care if any of them survived. The complete failure of this crew to attach the viewer to what should have been a sad tale of struggle cannot be forgiven.\n\nAnd to further insult us, of course the propaganda message before titles roll just had to be there, because let's face it. Unless you literally typed it on the screen, nobody would have grasped what this was even about. It was that bad.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6060,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"communism,deportation,soviet union,political repression,rape attempt","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ashes in the Snow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi372423193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2525790/","name":"Bel Powley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2966840/","name":"Lisa Loven Kongsli","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909412/","name":"Martin Wallström"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2101256/","name":"Marius A.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch.

There are many great Polish comedies written and directed by Bareja, but - I suppose - you have to live in Poland in 70's or 80's to understand them :)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1999-01-15","keywords":"sequel,second part,character name in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668640/","name":"Cezary Pazura","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469021/","name":"Malgorzata Kozuchowska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0720969/","name":"Janusz Rewinski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532702/","name":"Juliusz Machulski"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532702/","name":"Juliusz Machulski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953686/","name":"Ryszard Zatorski"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Charlie Chaplin kontra FBI</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Edgar Hoover to dyrektor FBI, który przez wiele lat prowadził obsesyjne dochodzenie w sprawie Charliego Chaplina. Mężczyzna szukał dowodów na to, że komik jest komunistycznym szpiegiem. W wielu filmach Chaplin wyśmiewał kapitalizm i konsumpcyjny styl życia Amerykanów, mówił też o bezsensie prowadzenia wojen, których celem jest wyłącznie nabijanie kieszeni rządzącym. Twórcy filmu przyglądają się tej sprawie.</desc>

Because it's Polish and we haven't had a lot of worthwhile Polish movies since Kieslowski?  Has it come to that?\n\nThe film takes Witold Gombrowicz's long-winded but intermittently fascinating classic novel and superimposes a gratuitous (and fatuous) Spielbergesque holocaust plot line, to make it all, I guess, more compelling.  The effect is glaringly contrived and (as with the far better Spielberg original) offensively trivializing.\n\nIn case anyone misses the point, the holocaust plot overlay involves a doomed little girl and, at the dénouement, a shift to a black-and-white background against which is displayed, in color, a talismanic link to her. Sound familiar?  Spielberg should sue.\n\nThe sad thing is that there is some talent at work here.  Though the plot is gratuitously confusing, meandering, and contrived, the use of a country house around which a low-intensity conflict between Germans and Polish partisans swirls obliquely is effective, with the fighting intruding suddenly into and then just as suddenly vanishing from the playing out of the protagonists' humdrum idleness and self-absorption.

Because it's Polish and we haven't had a lot of worthwhile Polish movies since Kieslowski?  Has it come to that?\n\nThe film takes Witold Gombrowicz's long-winded but intermittently fascinating classic novel and superimposes a gratuitous (and fatuous) Spielbergesque holocaust plot line, to make it all, I guess, more compelling.  The effect is glaringly contrived and (as with the far better Spielberg original) offensively trivializing.\n\nIn case anyone misses the point, the holocaust plot overlay involves a doomed little girl and, at the dénouement, a shift to a black-and-white background against which is displayed, in color, a talismanic link to her. Sound familiar?  Spielberg should sue.\n\nThe sad thing is that there is some talent at work here.  Though the plot is gratuitously confusing, meandering, and contrived, the use of a country house around which a low-intensity conflict between Germans and Polish partisans swirls obliquely is effective, with the fighting intruding suddenly into and then just as suddenly vanishing from the playing out of the protagonists' humdrum idleness and self-absorption.

Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr.

The catch? The UK's nuclear deterrent must remain unbroken, so the submarine stays on patrol and Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva (Suranne Jones) must go aboard to begin an investigation. Although the death was written off as an accidental overdose, Amy suspects foul play. But when the crew close ranks in the face of Amy's questioning, a new threat overshadows her inquiry."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

Marek, the main character of "Palimpsest," is a police inspector, a man on the verge of psychological disintegration trying to solve an intricate case. The story is told on two planes. The first one is a crime story, which constitutes the framework of the film. In the course of events, another theme appears - psychological experiences of the main character. Vivid blend of picture with sound and music will draw the audience into the deepest recesses of Marek's mind, making the viewers face questions: What is reality and what is only an illusion?

That's all I'm going to say, except the script was intriguing and the cast gave a great performance. Palimpsest is the kind of film that many people will want to see again to look for clues and details.\n\nI wish the sound mix had been a bit lower though as it was a bit jarring at times, especially since I almost dozed off because I'd had a long day. I saw Palimpsest at the Toronto International Film Festival, and the director's comments after the screening about how the screenplay changed during development and how he hates unnecessary dialog were interesting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":506,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"police inspector,murder,husband wife relationship,doctor","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162123/","name":"Magdalena Cielecka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327290/","name":"Robert Gonera"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1407454/","name":"Konrad Niewolski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067099/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023778/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107013/","name":"Igor Brejdygant"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0805580, Title: Palimpsest, 
 --- Description: Palimpsest: Directed by Konrad Niewolski. With Andrzej Chyra, Magdalena Cielecka, Robert Gonera, Tomasz Sapryk. Marek, the main character of "Palimpsest," is a police inspector, a man on the verge of psychological disintegration trying to solve an intricate case. The story is told on two planes. The first one is a crime story, which constitutes the framework of the film. In the course of events, another theme appears - psychological experiences of the main character. Vivid blend of picture with sound and music will draw the audience into the deepest recesses of Marek's mind, making the viewers face questions: What is reality and what is only an illusion? Where is the borderline between the real world and our perception of it? What makes suffering meaningful and what is really important in one's life"?" data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0805580/","name":"Palimpsest","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDg3Njg2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk4NTk5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Marek, the main character of "Palimpsest," is a police inspector, a man on the verge of psychological disintegration trying to solve an intricate case.

That's all I'm going to say, except the script was intriguing and the cast gave a great performance. Palimpsest is the kind of film that many people will want to see again to look for clues and details.\n\nI wish the sound mix had been a bit lower though as it was a bit jarring at times, especially since I almost dozed off because I'd had a long day. I saw Palimpsest at the Toronto International Film Festival, and the director's comments after the screening about how the screenplay changed during development and how he hates unnecessary dialog were interesting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":506,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"police inspector,murder,husband wife relationship,doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162123/","name":"Magdalena Cielecka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327290/","name":"Robert Gonera"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1407454/","name":"Konrad Niewolski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067099/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023778/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107013/","name":"Igor Brejdygant"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A breeze of fresh air in the genre.","reviewBody":"Admittedly, I felt very skeptical learning about a new polish production. Especially in a well-trodden genre of "missing-relative vs ncompetent-police vs genius-relative". I was proven wrong, so, so wrong from the very start till the very end. Klangor is an absolute masterpiece, briliant, captivating plot, amazing acting crew with a cherry on top soundtrack, building a wild ride through beuatiful polish landscapes. Unlike many others, it completes the experience with a very satisfying, bittersweet, yet really cohesive series finale. Give it a shot, its more than worth it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Crime"],"datePublished":"2021-03-26","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458971/","name":"Arkadiusz Jakubik","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652292/","name":"Maja Ostaszewska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1728821/","name":"Aleksandra Poplawska"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0506795/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We've all done our share of "dumping".

Equally, all of us (yes even Brad Pitt) have experienced what it feels like to "be" dumped and the complex emotions that unexpectedly follow.

For the rest of you who've at one time or another gotten your hearts ripped out of your chests and stomped into a million pieces only to turn you into unshaven, alcoholic hermits on the brink of starvation this movie is dedicated to you. \n\nTom (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) is a wanna-be architect turned professional greeting card writer whose life is thrown for a loop when he suddenly falls for the "new girl" Summer (Zooey Deschanel, Almost Famous). As one who appeared most certainly unattainable at first glance, Tom manages to charm her into what she coins as a, "casual relationship." Eventually, Tom ends up questioning their status with one another, which manages to put strain on the relationship, causing her to request the dreaded "time apart." (500) Days of Summer chronicles the bitter sweet beginnings, the untimely endings and all of that confusing stuff that takes place during the in betweens of a relationship that just isn't meant to be.\n\n(500) Days of Summer is presented in an effective non-linear style that sets it apart from its romantic comedy predecessors, rotating back and forth between dates signified by a simple title card flashing in between scenes (2), (50), (150) and so on to represent the various days in the course of Toms roller coaster of a relationship. This seesaw method of bouncing to and fro successfully manages to force the viewer in a physically engaging shared experience of Tom's feelings, which is something every director aspires to elicit from their intended audience. \n\nThe real kudos go to Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, whose script is practically flawless. You can't help but feel that their authenticity and attention to detail while constructing each scene through appropriately sarcastic and funny dialogue exchanges among all of the main characters involved, particularly those between Deschanel and Levitt which come across as heartbreakingly real and genuine.

Kupował tam świeże ryby i różnorodne owoce morza. Teraz dzieli się przepisami, nad którymi pracował przez lata. Podpowiada też, które ryby są najzdrowsze. W każdym odcinku zaprezentuje trzy smakowite propozycje - przystawkę, zupę i drugie danie.</desc>

Abortionist Vera Drake finds her beliefs and practices clash with the mores of 1950s Britain--a conflict that leads to tragedy for her family." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0383694/","name":"Vera Drake","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk1ZmNhNjEtMDZjZi00MTY1LTgwMmYtZDRiNmI4ZDRiNzQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_.jpg","description":"Abortionist Vera Drake finds her beliefs and practices clash with the mores of 1950s Britain--a conflict that leads to tragedy for her family.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0383694/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jotix100"},"dateCreated":"2004-11-06","inLanguage":"English","name":"Being kind, no matter how.","reviewBody":"The key for understanding the character of Vera Drake is "dear". Vera is one of the kindest souls one will ever see in pictures in a long, long time. Vera Drake is a woman who will go out of her way to be of use to anyone that needs her. In fact, one's initial reaction to Mrs. Drake's activities is one of complete disbelief.\n\nMike Leigh has created a film that, although not easy to sit through, is one of the finest movies that have come out of the English cinema in a long time. This director keeps getting better with every new film. The subject of the film is something that has been at the heart of the recent elections in the USA. With the new climate in this country it's easy to see that situations like the ones we see in the story, could well be the norm here in a not too distant future.\n\nThe main, and perhaps the only, reason for watching this extraordinary film is the portrayal of Vera by that wonderful actress, Imelda Staunton. Her Vera is an example a person who can't say no to anyone in need. There is a scene when Vera is first confronted by the police during a dinner at her house where we see her face as charges are hurled at her, then little by little, Ms. Staunton breaks down in what is one of the great moments in acting by any actress in living memory. One can see her eyes fill with tears because it suddenly dawns on Vera the immensity of what she has done.\n\nThe action takes place in 1950 in a London still ravaged by the effect of WWII. The film recreates the era with great details. Vera's flat is so tiny, one wonders how can four grown up people live in such cramped quarters. Even though they are poor, the Drake household is happy, as they all live together without apparently getting on each other's nerves. Both children, Ethel and Sid are well behaved; they both love their parents. Stan and Vera love one another in a subdued, but caring way. Is it possible that Vera could be the monster she is accused of being?\n\nThe film also makes a point of the contrast between the humble way in which the Drakes live and the rich houses where Vera goes to work every day. Vera's home is tiny and the others are so well appointed, it is only natural to assume that Vera will bear a resentment toward her employers, but on the contrary, she is a dignified woman who makes do with her meager wages.\n\nThere is also the irony about how Susan Wells, the daughter of one of Vera's employers, goes through the same thing that the other girls that Vera "helps", and everything is done in a civilized way. Mr. Leigh shows us in this case how things are different because Susan is able to buy a solution to her problem and deal with it safely.\n\nThe ensemble cast is marvelous. Imelda Staunton dominates the movie. We can't take our eyes away from the dowdy and plain woman we see on the screen. Phil Davis as Stan, Vera's husband, is excellent. Alex Kelly plays the mousy daughter Ethel, who never utters a word; this actress makes her real. Daniel Mays is Sid, the son who can't understand what his mother has done. Eddie Marsan as Reg, makes his character believable.\n\nThe film is a triumph for Mike Leigh.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25036,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"pregnancy,unwanted pregnancy,abortionist,female protagonist,panties","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Vera Drake","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1392181529","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxODkwYjctOWVkMi00Y2UwLTk1YjQtMWRmMWRhM2YyNmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxODkwYjctOWVkMi00Y2UwLTk1YjQtMWRmMWRhM2YyNmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001767/","name":"Imelda Staunton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000980/","name":"Jim Broadbent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186452/","name":"Heather Craney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005139/","name":"Mike Leigh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104092/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0207655/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005139/","name":"Mike Leigh"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, after 35 years, I still find this film a lot of fun to watch (even though it really should be experienced in a theater). Burt Lancaster is all stone-faced authority as Mel Bakersfield, the airport manager who neglects his wife (Dana Wynter) while lusting after his passenger relations agent (Jean Seberg). Dean Martin almost gives an actual performance as Vernon Demarest, the smooth-talking pilot who also neglects his wife (Barbara Hale) while having an affair with a stewardess (lovely Jacqueline Bisset)whom he has impregnated. George Kennedy began his long association with the character of Joe Patroni here(he would play the role in three subsequent sequels). Van Heflin is extremely effective as D.O. Guerrero, the sad and twisted man who plans to blow up an airliner. Helen Hayes won an Oscar playing Ada Quonsett, a little old lady who stows away on the plane, but that Oscar should have gone to Maureen Stapleton, who is just devastating as Guerrero's wife, who is totally dismayed about her husband's plan and is tragically heartbreaking during one brief scene near the end of the film. For those who like their adventure films spiced with some somewhat corny, soap suds, put your brain in check and have your fill with AIRPORT.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18652,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1970-03-05","keywords":"boeing 707,cockpit,air crew,airport,bomb","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1608826905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJhYWQwZTItZjc1NS00NjUzLThhYmMtZDU4NzMxNThlYjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJhYWQwZTItZjc1NS00NjUzLThhYmMtZDU4NzMxNThlYjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A bomber on board an airplane, an airport almost closed by snow, and various personal problems of the people involved."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000044/","name":"Burt Lancaster"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001509/","name":"Dean Martin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001421/","name":"George Kennedy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780833/","name":"George Seaton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368871/","name":"Henry Hathaway"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119020/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0354150/","name":"Arthur Hailey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780833/","name":"George Seaton"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Wino truskawkowe: Directed by Dariusz Jablonski. With Jirí Machácek, Zuzana Fialová, Marian Dziedziel, Mieczyslaw Grabka. This is not a love story though it is full of love. It is not a comedy though the characters often say funny things. It is not a detective story even though the hero is trying to solve a murder. It is not a nature drama though it shows the splendid colours and customs of the countryside. It is not a musical though Lubica expresses her longing in a passionate dance. Nor is it a film about ghosts though a ghost does ask the hero for a favour. A few draughts of Strawberry Wine are enough to take us into a magical world in the true centre of Europe, where love, crime and penitence are just as much a part of life as the changing of the seasons, the migration of birds or the flowing of a mountain stream." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1260596/","name":"Wino truskawkowe","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI5MjU4YjUtNGJkNy00Nzk2LTgyYWEtMDk0OTBmY2NmZTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgyNDg0NTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is not a love story though it is full of love.

Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.\n\nCrime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic `film noir' style, with its dark, brooding, cynical atmosphere. In `The Sting', however, George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised (as is the scenery), and the division of the film into sections with titles such as `The Hook' or `The Line' is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in black-and-white but in bright colour, and the mood, far from being heavy and brooding, is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin's music, although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set, fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly- Robert Shaw as the glowering, menacing Lonnegan, Robert Redford as the young, idealistic Hooker (insofar as a con-man can be said to be an idealist), and Paul Newman as the older, more experienced and laid-back Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.\n\nDespite the cheerful mood, the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as `heist' or `caper' movies, as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. `The Sting', however, is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt- Snyder, the one representative we see of the forces of law and order, is on Lonnegan's payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend's murder through the normal channels; the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet. An excellent film, which well deserved its Academy Award. 9/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1973-12-25","keywords":"con,con man,illegal activity,playing golf,con artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717122841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001351/","name":"George Roy Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911486/","name":"David S.

Very little outside 'the norm' is required for teenagers to ostracize one of their own. Sometimes it's a haircut or a brand of shoes, or even some other minor detail that sets them apart. But when it's a mental illness, the tribe can be merciless. Director Thor Freudenthal (DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, 2010) takes on Julia Walton's 2017 novel, with a screenplay from Nick Naveda. The film features two rising young stars and addresses some of the challenges brought on by the uncertainties associated with a mental illness.\n\nCharlie Plummer (so terrific in LEAN ON PETE, 2018) stars as Adam, a high school senior who has dealt with the challenges of undiagnosed mental health issues since he was quite young. His father abandoned the family years ago, and Adam's devoted mother (Molly Parker, "House of Cards") is not only patient and loving, but also committed to researching any possible treatment that would lead Adam to a better life. On the other hand, Adam and his mother's new live-in lover Paul (Walton Goggins) don't exactly see eye-to-eye on things, leading to more anxiety for Adam.\n\nIn an interesting and unique approach, director Freudenthal allows us to not only hear the voices Adam hears, but also see the hallucinations and visions he sees - three of whom are Rebecca (AnnaSophia Robb, THE WAY WAY BACK), a sweet, hippie-ish optimist; The Bodyguard (Lobo Sebastian), a cigar-chomping, bat swinging he-man; and Joaquin (Devon Bostick), an inappropriately horny 'best friend from a 90's move." On top of that, there is a black mist that periodically manifests, enveloping Adam and bringing on crippling fear and isolation. After a years-long stream of drug therapy, Adam is pronounced "treatment resistant" and diagnosed as schizophrenic. Adam's only mind-calming escape is when he's cooking. He knows his way around the kitchen and his goal is to attend Culinary School after graduation.\n\nOne day, Adam has a psychotic break during Chemistry class. He gets expelled, which jeopardizes his Culinary School dream. His mother gets him admitted to a Catholic School run by Sister Catherine (Beth Grant) at the same time he is accepted into an experimental drug trial. He's allowed to stay in school as long as he takes his meds and maintains his grades. It's here where he meets the dynamic Maya (Taylor Russell (WAVES, 2019). Maya is smart and ambitious and proud, and the two quickly form a bond - an interesting bond between two smart high school kids carrying their own burdens and holding their own secrets.\n\nSister Catherine is balancing the specific needs of Adam with her responsibility to the school, and then there is also prom and graduation to deal with. With the new drug, the voices and visions disappear, but Adam has some issues with the side effects. A desperate plea for help from Father Patrick (Andy Garcia), the school priest, provides a boost as Adam tells him, "It's nice to be listened to and not just observed." That line provides significant insight into what it's like to have this affliction, and that's really where the movie excels ... putting us in the shoes of a schizophrenic and allowing us to experience the good and bad moments. What can Adam trust? His eyes? His ears? His mind?\n\nAdam and Maya are both trying to figure out who they are, at the same time learning what it really means to love someone. Adam refers to his illness as his "burgeoning insanity", and in fact, schizophrenia does have a history of accelerating over time once it strikes a young person. The movie succeeds in taking away some of the mystique of mental illness, by making it approachable and something we want to better understand. There is a visual reference to Van Gogh's "Starry Night" that might be a bit too "nail on the head", but Freudenthal's movie is profound and features two very talented young actors. The humanity beneath the surface of those society would rather pretend don't exist is effectively compared to those stricken with cancer ... those we would do anything for. I watched this film back-to-back with another teen-drama-romance new release entitled CHEMICAL HEARTS, and it's extremely rare to find two such thought-provoking films centered on a pair of high school students ... but quite a treat (although I believe all 4 actors are long past high school age).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8066,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-08-21","keywords":"based on young adult novel,schizophrenia,hallucination,hospital,restraint","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3428105753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A teenager coping with paranoid schizophrenia hopes his new experimental drug treatment will help him navigate high school and the outside world."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4055138/","name":"Charlie Plummer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5347988/","name":"Taylor Russell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294457/","name":"Thor Freudenthal"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0811450/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0192696/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4550950/","name":"Nick Naveda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9649443/","name":"Julia Walton"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I watched this film back-to-back with another teen-drama-romance new release entitled CHEMICAL HEARTS, and it's extremely rare to find two such thought-provoking films centered on a pair of high school students ... but quite a treat (although I believe all 4 actors are long past high school age).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8066,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-08-21","keywords":"based on young adult novel,schizophrenia,hallucination,hospital,restraint","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3428105753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A teenager coping with paranoid schizophrenia hopes his new experimental drug treatment will help him navigate high school and the outside world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4055138/","name":"Charlie Plummer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5347988/","name":"Taylor Russell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294457/","name":"Thor Freudenthal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0811450/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0192696/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4550950/","name":"Nick Naveda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9649443/","name":"Julia Walton"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But neither of them wants to give up their house, and both remain living in it, getting on each other's nerves as they deliberately and maliciously annoy and attack each other, each in an attempt to get the other to give up and leave.\n\nIt's exactly the sort of film I don't normally enjoy, where two equally detestable parties go back and forth trying to one up each other with ridiculous shenanigans that are rarely funny and never make up for the ninety minutes of wasted time. It reminds me of dumb comedy films like Duplex—which pits neighbor against neighbor—and Are We There Yet?, in which Ice Cube goes up against his new girlfriend's mischievous kids. These sorts of films aren't typically my cup of tea, but it wasn't my turn to pick the movie, so I just sat back and watched.\n\nAnd then a funny thing occurred. Almost immediately, I got drawn into the story. That wasn't supposed to happen, but it did, and I was pleasantly surprised. I normally don't even care for Danny DeVito as a director, probably due to the fact that he made the awful Duplex, which I mentioned earlier. I mean, I did enjoy Matilda, but that was a family movie that I watched as a kid. War of the Roses was something else entirely, and despite my efforts, I couldn't help but enjoying it.\n\nIt tells the story in a different way than others of its kind. Things unfold naturally and totally believably. Sure, some of the stunts that the characters pull reach the same levels of ridiculousness as in those other films that I didn't like, but here we get the impression that it's done for the sake of the story, rather than for just another cheap laugh. Instead of yawning, I was wide sitting wide-eyed on the edge of my seat. It's not just funny; it's also very real and poignant, especially considering the fact that most of us know someone who's had a really tough divorce and it's easy to see how things could go just as bad as they do in War of the Roses.\n\nAnd, unlike most of these kinds of movies and apart from my expectations, we actually end up caring about the characters, despite their overabundance of flaws. They're both selfish idiots, which makes the story so much better, but they're still believable and very well acted. From moment to moment we find ourselves siding with each one. Neither of them could be called true protagonists, as they constantly antagonize each other, but there's a balance of both deserved animosity and loathsomeness between them that is very well done. They got good actors to play these roles, and they play them so well that we almost don't notice that it could have been much worse in the hands of anyone else.\n\nThe whole story is told by Danny DeVito, who plays a divorce attorney who is telling it as a warning to a prospective client who never says a word during the entire film. And the ending is great. I won't spoil it, but trust me, it's a good one. This definitely isn't the best film I've seen, but it's certainly the best of its kind, and makes me reconsider my attitude toward this type of film.

But neither of them wants to give up their house, and both remain living in it, getting on each other's nerves as they deliberately and maliciously annoy and attack each other, each in an attempt to get the other to give up and leave.\n\nIt's exactly the sort of film I don't normally enjoy, where two equally detestable parties go back and forth trying to one up each other with ridiculous shenanigans that are rarely funny and never make up for the ninety minutes of wasted time. It reminds me of dumb comedy films like Duplex—which pits neighbor against neighbor—and Are We There Yet?, in which Ice Cube goes up against his new girlfriend's mischievous kids. These sorts of films aren't typically my cup of tea, but it wasn't my turn to pick the movie, so I just sat back and watched.\n\nAnd then a funny thing occurred. Almost immediately, I got drawn into the story. That wasn't supposed to happen, but it did, and I was pleasantly surprised. I normally don't even care for Danny DeVito as a director, probably due to the fact that he made the awful Duplex, which I mentioned earlier. I mean, I did enjoy Matilda, but that was a family movie that I watched as a kid. War of the Roses was something else entirely, and despite my efforts, I couldn't help but enjoying it.\n\nIt tells the story in a different way than others of its kind. Things unfold naturally and totally believably. Sure, some of the stunts that the characters pull reach the same levels of ridiculousness as in those other films that I didn't like, but here we get the impression that it's done for the sake of the story, rather than for just another cheap laugh. Instead of yawning, I was wide sitting wide-eyed on the edge of my seat. It's not just funny; it's also very real and poignant, especially considering the fact that most of us know someone who's had a really tough divorce and it's easy to see how things could go just as bad as they do in War of the Roses.\n\nAnd, unlike most of these kinds of movies and apart from my expectations, we actually end up caring about the characters, despite their overabundance of flaws. They're both selfish idiots, which makes the story so much better, but they're still believable and very well acted. From moment to moment we find ourselves siding with each one. Neither of them could be called true protagonists, as they constantly antagonize each other, but there's a balance of both deserved animosity and loathsomeness between them that is very well done. They got good actors to play these roles, and they play them so well that we almost don't notice that it could have been much worse in the hands of anyone else.\n\nThe whole story is told by Danny DeVito, who plays a divorce attorney who is telling it as a warning to a prospective client who never says a word during the entire film. And the ending is great. I won't spoil it, but trust me, it's a good one. This definitely isn't the best film I've seen, but it's certainly the best of its kind, and makes me reconsider my attitude toward this type of film.

I just thought the whole idea was bad, but it turns out that it's often just done very poorly.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51509,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1989-12-08","keywords":"marital argument,sexuality,marital problem,embarrassment,gymnastics","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The War of the Roses","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1107034393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlhNmQ4NTYtODk4MS00NTRjLWFjMzAtZDhhMjBkMmM4YmM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlhNmQ4NTYtODk4MS00NTRjLWFjMzAtZDhhMjBkMmM4YmM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000678/","name":"Kathleen Turner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000362/","name":"Danny DeVito"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000362/","name":"Danny DeVito"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035761/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023875/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012258/","name":"Warren Adler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498775/","name":"Michael Leeson"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Only Better.","reviewBody":"Usually remakes aren't very good, with many bombing and being outshone by the original version. But to everyone's surprise 21 Jump Street was a hit, earning 200 million and giving the careers of both Hill and Tatum a big boost to two already big names. Then just like any action, the producers decided to throw more money at the same people hoping for the same result. Usually all this leads to is everything being the same but with more explosions and a bigger pay-check to get the same people back.. Well, that's exactly what 22 Jump Street also does, with as much as possible remaining just the same. The difference being that it's honest about it, with the entire film mocking the regular clichés.\n\nEven the outline of the plot mocks the regular concept of every sequel. Hill and Tatum are constantly reminded to do everything the exact same as last time at every chance they get to say it. The logic being since it worked last time, it'll work again. Only this time they'll throw more money at it to better ensure success. Because increasing the budget is certain to increase the profit. This is one of the many self aware jokes that the film keeps throwing at us. Usually staying fixed on joking that it's a sequel would get repetitive after a while, but the film just keeps handling it in different ways to keep the laughs coming. \n\nIt works because of the clever writing which parodies every detail of an action sequel, keeping the jokes fresh and original. They'll make a joke out of everything from the fact that things getting destroyed in car chases costs a lot in the budget to even John Woo's doves being randomly thrown in. At times some of the jokes don't work quite as well, but there's enough hilarious moments packed in to make sure the laughs keep coming and mocks every possible detail of the action sequel. \n\nOn top of this, the actors know how to make the jokes work with all the actors having the same charm as last time. Ice Cube gets his angry boss role down to the note, mastering the angry stare and yelling almost every line of dialogue he gets. The cameos from the villains be as over the top as you can get. And just like before, both Hill and Tatum bring their A game in their ultimate bromance together. It was one of the key elements of the first film and the actors chemistry remains just as funny and enjoyable here. If anything more so here, with their conversations growing more like a married couple and a lot more opportunities to be hilariously over the top. \n\nWhich is the main reason that 22 Jump Street is one of the few sequels that's better than the original. It's everything that 21 Jump Street was, just bigger and better. With the likes of this, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and the Lego Movie it's clear that Lord and Miller are quickly becoming 2 of the biggest and best names in comedy using both slapstick and mocking clichés to keep the laughs coming strong. I don't know whether they intend to do any more sequels, but as long as they maintain the consistently funny films that they have so far I can only hope that they make as many jump streets as they can.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":362433,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2014-06-18","keywords":"college,undercover,drugs,tattoo,hidden camera","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2671553817","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMTM2NDg0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1Nzg2MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMTM2NDg0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1Nzg2MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt and Jenko when they go deep undercover at a local college.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0520488/","name":"Phil Lord"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588087/","name":"Christopher Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0479739/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045209/","name":"Michael Bacall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3349927/","name":"Oren Uziel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0745247/","name":"Rodney Rothman"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But to everyone's surprise 21 Jump Street was a hit, earning 200 million and giving the careers of both Hill and Tatum a big boost to two already big names. Then just like any action, the producers decided to throw more money at the same people hoping for the same result. Usually all this leads to is everything being the same but with more explosions and a bigger pay-check to get the same people back.. Well, that's exactly what 22 Jump Street also does, with as much as possible remaining just the same. The difference being that it's honest about it, with the entire film mocking the regular clichés.\n\nEven the outline of the plot mocks the regular concept of every sequel. Hill and Tatum are constantly reminded to do everything the exact same as last time at every chance they get to say it. The logic being since it worked last time, it'll work again. Only this time they'll throw more money at it to better ensure success. Because increasing the budget is certain to increase the profit. This is one of the many self aware jokes that the film keeps throwing at us. Usually staying fixed on joking that it's a sequel would get repetitive after a while, but the film just keeps handling it in different ways to keep the laughs coming. \n\nIt works because of the clever writing which parodies every detail of an action sequel, keeping the jokes fresh and original. They'll make a joke out of everything from the fact that things getting destroyed in car chases costs a lot in the budget to even John Woo's doves being randomly thrown in. At times some of the jokes don't work quite as well, but there's enough hilarious moments packed in to make sure the laughs keep coming and mocks every possible detail of the action sequel. \n\nOn top of this, the actors know how to make the jokes work with all the actors having the same charm as last time. Ice Cube gets his angry boss role down to the note, mastering the angry stare and yelling almost every line of dialogue he gets. The cameos from the villains be as over the top as you can get. And just like before, both Hill and Tatum bring their A game in their ultimate bromance together. It was one of the key elements of the first film and the actors chemistry remains just as funny and enjoyable here. If anything more so here, with their conversations growing more like a married couple and a lot more opportunities to be hilariously over the top. \n\nWhich is the main reason that 22 Jump Street is one of the few sequels that's better than the original. It's everything that 21 Jump Street was, just bigger and better. With the likes of this, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and the Lego Movie it's clear that Lord and Miller are quickly becoming 2 of the biggest and best names in comedy using both slapstick and mocking clichés to keep the laughs coming strong. I don't know whether they intend to do any more sequels, but as long as they maintain the consistently funny films that they have so far I can only hope that they make as many jump streets as they can.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":362433,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2014-06-18","keywords":"college,undercover,drugs,tattoo,hidden camera","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2671553817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMTM2NDg0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1Nzg2MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMTM2NDg0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1Nzg2MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt and Jenko when they go deep undercover at a local college.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0520488/","name":"Phil Lord","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588087/","name":"Christopher Miller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0479739/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045209/","name":"Michael Bacall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3349927/","name":"Oren Uziel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0745247/","name":"Rodney Rothman"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1356206,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2009-10-14","keywords":"revenge,world war two,nazi,alternate history,jewish resistance","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inglourious Basterds: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3738173977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA4ZTZmMzItNmMyNS00MTk2LTg3MTgtNjYzZDBmMWJjYjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA4ZTZmMzItNmMyNS00MTk2LTg3MTgtNjYzZDBmMWJjYjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"International trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744834/","name":"Eli Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019267/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"}],"duration":"PT2H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1356206,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2009-10-14","keywords":"revenge,world war two,nazi,alternate history,jewish resistance","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inglourious Basterds: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3738173977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA4ZTZmMzItNmMyNS00MTk2LTg3MTgtNjYzZDBmMWJjYjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA4ZTZmMzItNmMyNS00MTk2LTg3MTgtNjYzZDBmMWJjYjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"International trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744834/","name":"Eli Roth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019267/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"],"duration":"PT2H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

On her rocky road ,Lionel/Lola will meet friendly faces : a young black man he's in love with -"I liked boys as a boy and so will I as a girl"-, a lesbian who welcomes father and son in her small hotel .... But the father is not prepared to accept the situation (the ashes in the gutter ,is it an accident?)\n\nThis is a marvelous plea for tolerance ,but it does not leave the viewer helpless or brooding : perhaps ,when they get to the sea,will there be some sunshine breaking through ?

On her rocky road ,Lionel/Lola will meet friendly faces : a young black man he's in love with -"I liked boys as a boy and so will I as a girl"-, a lesbian who welcomes father and son in her small hotel .... But the father is not prepared to accept the situation (the ashes in the gutter ,is it an accident?)\n\nThis is a marvelous plea for tolerance ,but it does not leave the viewer helpless or brooding : perhaps ,when they get to the sea,will there be some sunshine breaking through ? One feels that both are longing for affection ,now that mom is gone forever...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-11","keywords":"written by director,transgender,transgender girl,transgender protagonist,18 year old","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3989421849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDZkZTI3MWEtOWY4NS00ZmU2LWJiODYtNjVmMzg1MjIyZjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDZkZTI3MWEtOWY4NS00ZmU2LWJiODYtNjVmMzg1MjIyZjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9809276/","name":"Mya Bollaers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536095/","name":"Benoît Magimel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345980/","name":"Els Deceukelier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4714963/","name":"Laurent Micheli"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0295851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449322/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0310366/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4714963/","name":"Laurent Micheli"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The acting was top-tier, the plot was very interesting and the music adds a beautiful (and sometimes haunting) note to the film. Also, there was some great depiction of Latvian nature and sceneries. The ending was more than rewarding, not leaving any questions unanswered. The only thing that disappointed me was the official synopsis. What's the point in saying beforehands that the boy punishes the girl for saying bad things about his dead father, while in the film we discover that almost in the end? For about 70 minutes the only thing you know is that the boy did something very bad to the girl, but we still don't know why, until we see his last flashback, which kind of explains his behaviour.

The acting was top-tier, the plot was very interesting and the music adds a beautiful (and sometimes haunting) note to the film. Also, there was some great depiction of Latvian nature and sceneries. The ending was more than rewarding, not leaving any questions unanswered. The only thing that disappointed me was the official synopsis. What's the point in saying beforehands that the boy punishes the girl for saying bad things about his dead father, while in the film we discover that almost in the end? For about 70 minutes the only thing you know is that the boy did something very bad to the girl, but we still don't know why, until we see his last flashback, which kind of explains his behaviour. If you know that already, then you've got nothing to wait for.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-04","keywords":"boy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1642971929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3ODJmMmItMDBlMi00MTJiLTgzY2UtYjZmYjk2MmY3NjFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3ODJmMmItMDBlMi00MTJiLTgzY2UtYjZmYjk2MmY3NjFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","description":"After a neighbor's daughter throws some contemptuous remarks about his dead father, ten years old boy teaches the girl a cruel lesson thereby condemning himself in the eyes of the surrounding folk.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11075664/","name":"Damir Onackis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3688960/","name":"Dace Eversa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125588/","name":"Agata Buzek"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1797523/","name":"Dace Puce"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0616930/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11069042/","name":"Jana Egle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9413330/","name":"Monta Gagane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1797523/","name":"Dace Puce"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

On her rocky road ,Lionel/Lola will meet friendly faces : a young black man he's in love with -"I liked boys as a boy and so will I as a girl"-, a lesbian who welcomes father and son in her small hotel .... But the father is not prepared to accept the situation (the ashes in the gutter ,is it an accident?)\n\nThis is a marvelous plea for tolerance ,but it does not leave the viewer helpless or brooding : perhaps ,when they get to the sea,will there be some sunshine breaking through ?

 --- Description: Lola vers la mer: Directed by Laurent Micheli. With Mya Bollaers, Benoît Magimel, Els Deceukelier, Sami Outalbali. Lola, 18 years old, bleach blonde hair, lives in a foster home with Samir, her only friend. Impulsive and lonely, she is trying to get her diploma as a veterinary assistant. When her mother passes away, her father Phillip makes sure that Lola will miss the ceremony. Two years before that, Philip was throwing her out of the family home: at the time, Lola was still Lionel - Philippe is determined to fulfill Catherine's last wish: to be dispersed to the North Sea, in the dunes of her childhood home. Lola on the other hand is furious against her father, but she will not leave her mother alone in this last journey. So they take off together, both unwilling to share a car but determined to take Catherine home." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt8356178/","name":"Lola vers la mer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ2YTYyZTctYzM0OS00N2U3LTk3MDAtZmQ2MDFiMmFlODJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE0NTk0MjQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lola, 18 years old, bleach blonde hair, lives in a foster home with Samir, her only friend.

On her rocky road ,Lionel/Lola will meet friendly faces : a young black man he's in love with -"I liked boys as a boy and so will I as a girl"-, a lesbian who welcomes father and son in her small hotel .... But the father is not prepared to accept the situation (the ashes in the gutter ,is it an accident?)\n\nThis is a marvelous plea for tolerance ,but it does not leave the viewer helpless or brooding : perhaps ,when they get to the sea,will there be some sunshine breaking through ? One feels that both are longing for affection ,now that mom is gone forever...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-11","keywords":"written by director,transgender,transgender girl,transgender protagonist,18 year old","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3989421849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDZkZTI3MWEtOWY4NS00ZmU2LWJiODYtNjVmMzg1MjIyZjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDZkZTI3MWEtOWY4NS00ZmU2LWJiODYtNjVmMzg1MjIyZjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9809276/","name":"Mya Bollaers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536095/","name":"Benoît Magimel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345980/","name":"Els Deceukelier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4714963/","name":"Laurent Micheli"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0295851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449322/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0310366/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4714963/","name":"Laurent Micheli"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It plot is about Guanajuato mother, Magdalena (played by Hernández) trying to search for her missing son, Jesus (played by Varela) at the U.S./Mexico border.\n\nIt some ways, the story becomes an emotional, traumatic road trip, exploring the "border" within fear, anxiety, even looking into surveillance border technology and "coyote" subcultures.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1290,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-27","keywords":"mother,mother searches for missing son,u.s. mexico border,mexico,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466403609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDNiMTE1YzMtNGEyMy00NjhiLWE4YmUtYzcxYWY5NThhMTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDNiMTE1YzMtNGEyMy00NjhiLWE4YmUtYzcxYWY5NThhMTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2543344/","name":"Mercedes Hernández","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6468037/","name":"David Illescas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11190555/","name":"Juan Jesús Varela"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3635576/","name":"Fernanda Valadez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0344964/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0629542/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564009/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2156418/","name":"Astrid Rondero","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3635576/","name":"Fernanda Valadez"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Although I believe this to be a surreal concoction of ambitious filmmaking, with emotionally charged moments of anguish, psychoticism, and violence, I was left with little inference about why this film was made.\n\nJonas Kærup Hjort is obviously a talented director with an artistic vision and interesting editing and cinematography. However, the writing felt so confusing and too personal and even psychoanalytic for me and the audience to follow the points.\n\nIt would have truly have been a privilege to speak with the director about his artistic vision - in particular related to his unclear and fragmented script.

Although I believe this to be a surreal concoction of ambitious filmmaking, with emotionally charged moments of anguish, psychoticism, and violence, I was left with little inference about why this film was made.\n\nJonas Kærup Hjort is obviously a talented director with an artistic vision and interesting editing and cinematography. However, the writing felt so confusing and too personal and even psychoanalytic for me and the audience to follow the points.\n\nIt would have truly have been a privilege to speak with the director about his artistic vision - in particular related to his unclear and fragmented script. Nonetheless, a unique experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-11-25","keywords":"male frontal nudity,male nudity,male rear nudity,surrealism,absurdism","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1572044/","name":"Joen Højerslev","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082343/","name":"Joen Bille","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0282166/","name":"Anne Fletting"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9099639/","name":"Jonas Kærup Hjort"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0825066/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9099639/","name":"Jonas Kærup Hjort"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But it's also wonderful- and haunting- because it evokes what it is to look back on something and remember things vividly, clearly, with a subjectivity that is startling in its scarred interior. This is child-actor Linda Manz, her first role in what is a relatively small career, and she voices, in grungy but fine vocal, from afar at times even as she's one of the principle players.\n\nShe's the kid sister of Bill (Richard Gere, a very good if not extraordinary performance compared to others), a factory worker who kills a man by accident and runs off with his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams), and the three of them end up working for a farmer (Sam Shephard), and soon there's a love triangle formed wrapped around an elaborate con of Bill and Abby being brother and sister. These are just the facts, but director Terence Malick isn't after just those, but after a sad look back from a perspective of wonderment and horror and a kind of fractured innocence. It goes without saying that since it is a Malick picture one will expect the painterly landscapes of the fields, those intimate close-ups with bugs and waving fields of grass. But Malick is able to put a unique vision into the perspective of that of a little girl, who is seeing and experiencing everything as it is, not as it may be really imagined or wanting to be.\n\nSo there's a lot of interest already just in the nature of the farming on this panhandle in early 20th century. But there's just little things, little fantastic bits that stick in your mind, probably forever: the workers in the field toiling away; the black man tap-dancing by the barn; the airplane circus people coming by and showing silent films. Most notably, as well, are near biblical visions like the plague (and extinguishing by lots of fire) of locusts. And through all of the many, many beautiful shots, there's a tender and perfectly tragic love story played out with great work by Adams and a young Shepherd. Manz too, I might add, is excellent in a role that could have been mucked up by anyone else (also trumping a later future first-time performance in Malick's own The New World with the woman playing Pocahontas).\n\nAnd as if the crisp eye of Malick and his DPs Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler weren't enough, there's Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack to boot. Here's a crucial part of Malick's success in translating the theme of remembrance and feeling both the moment and the mood of the whole period and characters in the film (sometimes combined): just listen to the theme of the movie, used later in movie trailers and commercials, as it reckons a nostalgic tinge for something that one can't firmly grasp but is felt deeply and without really fully knowing the whole scope. Overall, Days of Heaven is almost too good, too beautiful- it's the kind of picture that defines reputations, for better or worse. Like Malick's.

A hot-tempered farm laborer convinces the woman he loves to marry their rich but dying boss so that they can have a claim to his fortune." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0077405/","name":"Days of Heaven","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMyZmU4OGYtNjBiYS00YTIxLWJjMDUtZjczZmQwMTM4YjQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI4MjkwNjA@._V1_.jpg","description":"A hot-tempered farm laborer convinces the woman he loves to marry their rich but dying boss so that they can have a claim to his fortune.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0077405/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Quinoa1984","dateCreated":"2008-09-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Remembrance of Things Past","reviewBody":"Days of Heaven is, in fact, what its highest praisers want you to believe: awe-inspiring cinema, sometimes even mind-blowing in what can be filmed and brought forth in a beautiful, seamless mold of narrative and poetry, photographed with an eye for the prairie and fields like very few others and for the period detail. But it's also wonderful- and haunting- because it evokes what it is to look back on something and remember things vividly, clearly, with a subjectivity that is startling in its scarred interior. This is child-actor Linda Manz, her first role in what is a relatively small career, and she voices, in grungy but fine vocal, from afar at times even as she's one of the principle players.\n\nShe's the kid sister of Bill (Richard Gere, a very good if not extraordinary performance compared to others), a factory worker who kills a man by accident and runs off with his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams), and the three of them end up working for a farmer (Sam Shephard), and soon there's a love triangle formed wrapped around an elaborate con of Bill and Abby being brother and sister. These are just the facts, but director Terence Malick isn't after just those, but after a sad look back from a perspective of wonderment and horror and a kind of fractured innocence. It goes without saying that since it is a Malick picture one will expect the painterly landscapes of the fields, those intimate close-ups with bugs and waving fields of grass. But Malick is able to put a unique vision into the perspective of that of a little girl, who is seeing and experiencing everything as it is, not as it may be really imagined or wanting to be.\n\nSo there's a lot of interest already just in the nature of the farming on this panhandle in early 20th century. But there's just little things, little fantastic bits that stick in your mind, probably forever: the workers in the field toiling away; the black man tap-dancing by the barn; the airplane circus people coming by and showing silent films. Most notably, as well, are near biblical visions like the plague (and extinguishing by lots of fire) of locusts. And through all of the many, many beautiful shots, there's a tender and perfectly tragic love story played out with great work by Adams and a young Shepherd. Manz too, I might add, is excellent in a role that could have been mucked up by anyone else (also trumping a later future first-time performance in Malick's own The New World with the woman playing Pocahontas).\n\nAnd as if the crisp eye of Malick and his DPs Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler weren't enough, there's Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack to boot. Here's a crucial part of Malick's success in translating the theme of remembrance and feeling both the moment and the mood of the whole period and characters in the film (sometimes combined): just listen to the theme of the movie, used later in movie trailers and commercials, as it reckons a nostalgic tinge for something that one can't firmly grasp but is felt deeply and without really fully knowing the whole scope. Overall, Days of Heaven is almost too good, too beautiful- it's the kind of picture that defines reputations, for better or worse. Like Malick's.

When Becky loses her job, she drinks a lot of booze with her best friend Suze (Krysten Ritter) and sends an offensive letter to the editor Luke Brandon (Hugh Dancy) from the financial magazine "Successful Saving" and an article to Alette to show her potential.

Meanwhile the debt collector Derek Smeath (Robert Stanton) is chasing Becky and she is avoiding him everywhere, telling that he is an ex-boyfriend that is stalking her.

To be clear this is a fine movie, it's just what you'd expect from this type of movie. In fact I'd say it is slightly above average, but only slightly.\n\nThe technical elements are decent. It's pretty well shot, but there are some distracting shots as well. There's some scenes in a desert area where they show the night sky, and some shots look very nice, but for others it was distracting because of the way it was edited. I'm not sure if it was the color grading, or if they used some other VFX's but it just looked off, and it took me out of many scenes. I saw it with my family and my father who almost never notices VFX noticed this in particular and pointed it out.\n\nThe acting is pretty solid. The main child actor is definitely better than most child actors and handles the movie well. He's able to play off with the other adult actors as if they were a real family. None of the actors are that great, but they're all quite good with their characters, and feel authentic. There's some good stuff handled with maturity here, but there's also some silly or melodramatic character moments you'd come to expect from these movies. For the most part though this movie does it a lot less than most I've seen, it wasn't annoying or anything.\n\nEdward James Olmos is also in this movie. He's easily the best actor, but they don't do too much with him. In fact he's laying down for most of the movie. He's most used for these cheesy moments, like him narrating some quotes you'd see on a Facebook mother's page every few minutes in the movie. It's completely unnecessary, but at least his voice is nice. The movie has a fine message, it's just been said to death in these coming of age stories. Perhaps I just don't like the genre unless it's doing something inventive or subversive.\n\nI appreciate the short length. Many of these types of movies try to be way longer than they should and it just looses me. Especially with these simple plots that are predictable and have to be carried by their execution. I can't say I was particularly engaged with this, but it mostly kept my attention, and I'd say I enjoyed it enough for me not to dislike it. That being said for this particular movie I did think it could've maybe used a bit more time for certain things. Some side characters are very thin. There's a few moments where something big happens, or something interesting could happen, and then it just cuts away or to the future and it's resolved. There's also a few scenes where I felt some character relationships and motives could've been better fleshed out because there's some drama I was questioning why it was exactly happening.\n\nI would not usually criticize a movie for its rating, but this movie truly had no reason to be going for an R-Rating. The swearing was unnecessary, and quite vulgar for the children too. Not that kids don't swear, it's actually somewhat realistic to some kids nowadays, but making a coming of age story about a boy and his father and alienating the audience who will identify with the boy is kinda dumb. It especially feels forced when there's a pointless sex scene with nudity in the middle of it. If perhaps the swearing and nudity was necessary for some actual plot or character purpose, then fine, but to me it just felt forced on and pointless.\n\nOne of this movies selling points is how it took 5 years to film because they waited for the main actor to age up to film scenes in the future. Honestly this was just a gimmick and pointless. The scenes are so minimal they could've used any other actor and it wouldn't have really been a big deal. I doubt many people would've even cared or noticed. It's completely unecessaey especially when none of the other cast comes back. In fact those scenes aren't even that important to the overall movie and it could've been written out. This isn't a criticism, I just wanted to point that out.\n\nThese may seem like nitpicks, but there just isn't that much to talk about with this movie, and I want to justify being the only non positive review so far. Overall there is nothing that I found to be bad about this movie, but there's nothing that's that good either. If you're a fan of these coming of age stories you'll probably enjoy this, but don't watch it with your kids. Is it better than the average one? Yes, but only by a little. At the very least it's very short so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Most people will probably like it but it's not a movie that will stick you with you unless it particularly relates to you. I'd wait for it to be on a streaming site if it interests you instead of buying it.\n\n(5.5/10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-10-15","keywords":"boy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chasing Wonders","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1614200857","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI5YjRiMzAtZWQ3OC00OWRkLWFmMjUtZDRhNzVlYjg0ZTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI5YjRiMzAtZWQ3OC00OWRkLWFmMjUtZDRhNzVlYjg0ZTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891895/","name":"Paz Vega"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001579/","name":"Edward James Olmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2847302/","name":"Jessica Marais"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12048890/","name":"Paul Meins"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0774805/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250736/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0243632/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0606688/","name":"Judy Morris"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To be clear this is a fine movie, it's just what you'd expect from this type of movie. In fact I'd say it is slightly above average, but only slightly.\n\nThe technical elements are decent. It's pretty well shot, but there are some distracting shots as well. There's some scenes in a desert area where they show the night sky, and some shots look very nice, but for others it was distracting because of the way it was edited. I'm not sure if it was the color grading, or if they used some other VFX's but it just looked off, and it took me out of many scenes. I saw it with my family and my father who almost never notices VFX noticed this in particular and pointed it out.\n\nThe acting is pretty solid. The main child actor is definitely better than most child actors and handles the movie well. He's able to play off with the other adult actors as if they were a real family. None of the actors are that great, but they're all quite good with their characters, and feel authentic. There's some good stuff handled with maturity here, but there's also some silly or melodramatic character moments you'd come to expect from these movies. For the most part though this movie does it a lot less than most I've seen, it wasn't annoying or anything.\n\nEdward James Olmos is also in this movie. He's easily the best actor, but they don't do too much with him. In fact he's laying down for most of the movie. He's most used for these cheesy moments, like him narrating some quotes you'd see on a Facebook mother's page every few minutes in the movie. It's completely unnecessary, but at least his voice is nice. The movie has a fine message, it's just been said to death in these coming of age stories. Perhaps I just don't like the genre unless it's doing something inventive or subversive.\n\nI appreciate the short length. Many of these types of movies try to be way longer than they should and it just looses me. Especially with these simple plots that are predictable and have to be carried by their execution. I can't say I was particularly engaged with this, but it mostly kept my attention, and I'd say I enjoyed it enough for me not to dislike it. That being said for this particular movie I did think it could've maybe used a bit more time for certain things. Some side characters are very thin. There's a few moments where something big happens, or something interesting could happen, and then it just cuts away or to the future and it's resolved. There's also a few scenes where I felt some character relationships and motives could've been better fleshed out because there's some drama I was questioning why it was exactly happening.\n\nI would not usually criticize a movie for its rating, but this movie truly had no reason to be going for an R-Rating. The swearing was unnecessary, and quite vulgar for the children too. Not that kids don't swear, it's actually somewhat realistic to some kids nowadays, but making a coming of age story about a boy and his father and alienating the audience who will identify with the boy is kinda dumb. It especially feels forced when there's a pointless sex scene with nudity in the middle of it. If perhaps the swearing and nudity was necessary for some actual plot or character purpose, then fine, but to me it just felt forced on and pointless.\n\nOne of this movies selling points is how it took 5 years to film because they waited for the main actor to age up to film scenes in the future. Honestly this was just a gimmick and pointless. The scenes are so minimal they could've used any other actor and it wouldn't have really been a big deal. I doubt many people would've even cared or noticed. It's completely unecessaey especially when none of the other cast comes back. In fact those scenes aren't even that important to the overall movie and it could've been written out. This isn't a criticism, I just wanted to point that out.\n\nThese may seem like nitpicks, but there just isn't that much to talk about with this movie, and I want to justify being the only non positive review so far. Overall there is nothing that I found to be bad about this movie, but there's nothing that's that good either. If you're a fan of these coming of age stories you'll probably enjoy this, but don't watch it with your kids. Is it better than the average one? Yes, but only by a little. At the very least it's very short so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Most people will probably like it but it's not a movie that will stick you with you unless it particularly relates to you. I'd wait for it to be on a streaming site if it interests you instead of buying it.\n\n(5.5/10)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-10-15","keywords":"boy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chasing Wonders","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1614200857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI5YjRiMzAtZWQ3OC00OWRkLWFmMjUtZDRhNzVlYjg0ZTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI5YjRiMzAtZWQ3OC00OWRkLWFmMjUtZDRhNzVlYjg0ZTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891895/","name":"Paz Vega","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001579/","name":"Edward James Olmos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2847302/","name":"Jessica Marais"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12048890/","name":"Paul Meins"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0774805/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250736/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0243632/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0606688/","name":"Judy Morris"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie.

This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments.

I thought that Denzel Washington was pretty good, but he seems to have settled into a type. Confident and unyielding and always right (Coach Boone from Remember the Titans). This is fine and I enjoy watching him. This movie is about a bank robbery where the perpetrators are after more than money. It has to do with a righteous cause, but what happens is that the possibility of pulling it off and getting what they want is on such fragile ground that you need to ask the question, "Isn't there an easier way?" Anyway, the scenes in the bank are quite good but we really need to extend our disbelief at times. I've always wondered about that "get me a plane and a million dollars" business anyway. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. See this and enjoy the characters, but in the long run, it's pretty far fetched.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":357931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought that Denzel Washington was pretty good, but he seems to have settled into a type. Confident and unyielding and always right (Coach Boone from Remember the Titans). This is fine and I enjoy watching him. This movie is about a bank robbery where the perpetrators are after more than money. It has to do with a righteous cause, but what happens is that the possibility of pulling it off and getting what they want is on such fragile ground that you need to ask the question, "Isn't there an easier way?" Anyway, the scenes in the bank are quite good but we really need to extend our disbelief at times. I've always wondered about that "get me a plane and a million dollars" business anyway. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. See this and enjoy the characters, but in the long run, it's pretty far fetched.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":357931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":430315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A world of wonder that I experienced watching recordings from space shuttle missions and Hubble documentaries. And I am happy about it.\n\nThe main stars are Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), and they are the only people whose living faces we see throughout the movie. What we see are probably the best space visuals in a movie that have been ever part of a non-documentary. The visuals are crisp and steady. A welcome change from all the shaky-cam that we see in the recent cinema.\n\nAn interesting and refreshing point was proper use of the first-person camera. I felt as if I was looking from inside of the space suit. I felt that strange mix of claustrophobia and agoraphobia that is possible to experience only in the vastness of space while being in this insignificant amount of fabric and tech. These shots were few which made them significant and were well established in the relationship to the surrounding so I knew where I was looking at all times. One of the harder things to achieve in the emptiness of space.\n\nThe film was perfectly paced for a space movie. Coming into the movie, I was ready for extremely slow space walks, but Cuaróns managed to beat my expectations by introducing welcome highly dynamic scenes to separate off the slower paced ones.\n\nThe plot was fairly standard, but here again Cuaróns managed to keep it very fresh by giving us one large surprise mid-film.

A world of wonder that I experienced watching recordings from space shuttle missions and Hubble documentaries. And I am happy about it.\n\nThe main stars are Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), and they are the only people whose living faces we see throughout the movie. What we see are probably the best space visuals in a movie that have been ever part of a non-documentary. The visuals are crisp and steady. A welcome change from all the shaky-cam that we see in the recent cinema.\n\nAn interesting and refreshing point was proper use of the first-person camera. I felt as if I was looking from inside of the space suit. I felt that strange mix of claustrophobia and agoraphobia that is possible to experience only in the vastness of space while being in this insignificant amount of fabric and tech. These shots were few which made them significant and were well established in the relationship to the surrounding so I knew where I was looking at all times. One of the harder things to achieve in the emptiness of space.\n\nThe film was perfectly paced for a space movie. Coming into the movie, I was ready for extremely slow space walks, but Cuaróns managed to beat my expectations by introducing welcome highly dynamic scenes to separate off the slower paced ones.\n\nThe plot was fairly standard, but here again Cuaróns managed to keep it very fresh by giving us one large surprise mid-film. One major problem with the movie was that it did not make me care for Stone which was essential to sink into the movie. Cuaróns made a strange decision to make her a person without family. Meaning that her only motivation to survive was her own survival instinct. But this decision meant that Stone could explore some topics that are available only to people without stronger survival motivations.\n\nOn a more nit-picky note, what was with that in-your-face symbolism of a womb in the middle of the movie. Either I have not noticed other symbols, or in a film with a very few symbols, there is one that is sticking out and heavily disrupting the flow of the story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":799099,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release, so I ended up getting a little more than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining, to say the least.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

She meets Jack (Jamie Dornan) and Frank (Sebastian Stan) at a party.\n\nThe story is aimless which seems to be the point. Daphne is aimless and it makes for an aimless watch. It's as tiresome as that sounds. It's a lot of hot people having boring melodramas. On a minor note, I don't like the text style. The hipster colorized text is harder to read and is simpler trying too hard. I would have quit after thirty minutes if it isn't against my policy. There is a lot of stops and starts. I have nothing to cling to with these characters. I don't care about them and I don't really know the guys. With Dornan, I'm just reminded of 50 Shades and that's not a good thing. That may or may not be his fault but it is definitely unavoidable. The sex scenes don't help. As for Shailene, I applaud her attempts at being a little different than the constant MPDG. She does need a more discriminating eye for the material. This is a hipster melodrama of the boring kind.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-05-01","keywords":"love triangle,personal growth,love,two word title,indie movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2840510233","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5ZGViMjctYjQwYi00Mjk3LWJmMTQtMTFjY2I2MzU3MjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5ZGViMjctYjQwYi00Mjk3LWJmMTQtMTFjY2I2MzU3MjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In present day Los Angeles, Daphne, a thirty something woman, navigates love and heartbreak over the course of one year.

She's struggling to find a job and vows to stop drinking. She's living under her sister Billie (Lindsay Sloane) and her family. She meets Jack (Jamie Dornan) and Frank (Sebastian Stan) at a party.\n\nThe story is aimless which seems to be the point. Daphne is aimless and it makes for an aimless watch. It's as tiresome as that sounds. It's a lot of hot people having boring melodramas. On a minor note, I don't like the text style. The hipster colorized text is harder to read and is simpler trying too hard. I would have quit after thirty minutes if it isn't against my policy. There is a lot of stops and starts. I have nothing to cling to with these characters. I don't care about them and I don't really know the guys. With Dornan, I'm just reminded of 50 Shades and that's not a good thing. That may or may not be his fault but it is definitely unavoidable. The sex scenes don't help. As for Shailene, I applaud her attempts at being a little different than the constant MPDG. She does need a more discriminating eye for the material. This is a hipster melodrama of the boring kind.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-05-01","keywords":"love triangle,personal growth,love,two word title,indie movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2840510233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5ZGViMjctYjQwYi00Mjk3LWJmMTQtMTFjY2I2MzU3MjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5ZGViMjctYjQwYi00Mjk3LWJmMTQtMTFjY2I2MzU3MjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In present day Los Angeles, Daphne, a thirty something woman, navigates love and heartbreak over the course of one year.

Four years later, all three characters try to find their own personal sense of peace or redemption during WWII.\n\nThis brief synopsis does nothing to explain the intricate complexities of the plot and actions that take place. Although Keira Knightley's performance is slightly off-putting due to the fact she appears like she just escaped from a concentration camp (surely young British socialites did not look like this in the 1930's), the stunning cast shows full range here racing through curious emotions: spite, lust, recklessness, and selfish wanton abandon. The facial expressions, especially from the children in the early scenes on the estate, are priceless. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic as they are often vain, self-absorbed, and quite silly in their drama, but they are fascinating to watch. The first third of the film is played like a "Masterpiece Theater" production of "The Great Gatsby" as seen through the eyes of Nancy Drew.\n\nHowever, what makes "Atonement" soar is the impeccable direction of Joe Wright. He makes the most audacious coming-of-age as an auteur since Anthony Minghella delivered "The English Patient" back in 1996. Wright displays a near Kubrickian mastery of sound effects (notice the strikes of the typewriter keys) that transition from scene to scene and often bleed into the amazing score from Dario Marianelli. Wright also crafts a finely textured mise-en-scene that visually translates McEwan's richly composed story onto the screen with near note perfect fashion. Nothing can really prepare you for how well directed this film is until you see it, and the scene of the three soldiers arriving on the beach at the Dunkirk evacuation is one of the greatest stand alone unedited panning long shots ever captured on film. It left me gasping.\n\nThat scene leads to the heart of the film. The often clichéd romance at the core is trumped by Wright's depiction of Robbie, a single man forlorn and obsessed, his dizzying inner turmoil reflected against the grand canvas of a chaotic world at war. Likewise, Briony's redemption comes not in the too-clever conclusion at the end of the film, but in the intimate and symbolic confessional at the bedside of a dying French soldier. These moments leave lasting impressions, and left me imagining that if Joe Wright were to ever adapt Irene Nemiorovsky's "Suite Francaise" onto the silver screen, he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave "Gone With Wind" spinning in its gilded Hollywood grave.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":266817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-01-23","keywords":"world war two,rape,false accusation,sex,loss of virginity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Atonement","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836805401","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Atonement trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564215/","name":"James McAvoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358960/","name":"Christopher Hampton"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

These moments leave lasting impressions, and left me imagining that if Joe Wright were to ever adapt Irene Nemiorovsky's "Suite Francaise" onto the silver screen, he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave "Gone With Wind" spinning in its gilded Hollywood grave.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":266817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-01-23","keywords":"world war two,rape,false accusation,sex,loss of virginity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Atonement","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836805401","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Atonement trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564215/","name":"James McAvoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358960/","name":"Christopher Hampton"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release, so I ended up getting a little more than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining, to say the least.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release, so I ended up getting a little more than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining, to say the least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.\n\nThe film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.\n\nIt is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.\n\nThen, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).\n\nThis love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.\n\nBeautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.\n\nAnd that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'. \n\n-Dan Henry, 20th July 2008","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1057247,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"robot,obesity,recycling robot,adrift in space,cgi animation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wall E","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192703769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Wall E - Trailer #3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123785/","name":"Ben Burtt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2264184/","name":"Elissa Knight"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307531/","name":"Jeff Garlin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0622634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714114/","name":"Jim Reardon"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

People may also find other ways or reasons to hate it (probably involves current issues politics bs etc.) but seriously it's not bad. You also have to remember these movies are kids movies based on a kids book so if your pissed that a movie from your childhood has been remade, that's sad. At least they waited 30 years to do it.

The reasoning behind this hard-to-sell concept is simple; the dead, that is, the spirit likeness of a human being, in modern society are usually treated with grave seriousness. From the grim tales of the Bible to images of mourning families trying to 'celebrate' during a wake; the concepts of the afterlife and comedy quite often juxtapose to the point where bemusement brought on through absurdity is more commonplace than laughter. Therefore it was no surprise earlier this year when romantic comedy Over Her Dead Body failed to deliver much laughs or even romance at all, instead only taking the two clashing ideas and, well, clashing them together hoping it would all work out in the end (it didn't). While Ghost Town doesn't necessarily do anything remotely different from the aforementioned feature –at least concerning the script's comedy department- it is in the movie's emotional core and characters present that such clashing of half-baked spiritual plotting with slapstick comedy gets softened into something a lot more digestible. The result is a story that fails to register on an engaging level based upon its basic premise alone, but eventually more than makes up for it with a sweet romance that tickles just as much as it warms the heart.\n\nBertram Pincus (Ricky Gervais) is a sad, lonely man, and although he would argue otherwise, has nobody to blame but himself. A cynically jaded misanthrope who goes out of his way to avoid all human contact, Pincus doesn't necessarily describe himself as a people person and doesn't want others to think so either. After a routine colonoscopy goes wrong in the anaesthetic department, Bertram clinically dies for seven minutes and wakes up a changed man; or at least the same man in a changed world. Now blessed with the ability to see the dead and communicate with them, Pincus not only has to deal with the living, but the dead too. Sure enough, it's pure baloney, and it certainly starts off that way with little hints at going anywhere else. Thankfully however, it's not long until certain romantic elements creep in involving recently widowed (you can hopefully see how this occurs) Gwen which allows both Bertram and the movie as a whole to shed their silly outer layer to reveal some emotional depth. Of course, the walking dead thing continues on throughout the entire feature, but thankfully it isn't as tacked on as you might imagine. Plus, linking the ghost plot with a living, breathing core, the movie brings both elements to a close effectively that capitalises on the development that was given to each beforehand. Yes, it's possibly the weakest element of the feature, but that's not really saying much at all.\n\nBy the far the greatest thing about Ghost Town however lies in its comedy, which is fronted by lead man Ricky Gervais, who teams up alongside Greg Kinnear to create a movie with both class and wit, not to mention a little bit of welcome shtick. Gervais, who goes about his role here with about the same mentality as he has so far implemented in his TV roles, delivers a wonderful performance here that embodies his character's comedic cynicism with absolute precision. If you already know the comedian then you know that much of his charm and natural comic ability comes from his timing and delivery; he doesn't necessarily try to make you laugh, and it isn't in the things he says, but how he says them, and when he does so. Through this Gervais makes sure not only to deliver his jokes with enough frequency to keep amusement levels high, but he crafts a character out of such moments too; the jokes never cheapen his persona, but only strengthen it.\n\nBacking star Kinnear plays Gervais' ghost buddy-of-sorts, and while he does a lot of background work, nevertheless creates a strong enough character himself, doing well not to take focus from the lead, and yet making sure to create something interesting to look at when the focus shifts from time to time. Téa Leoni provides as the film's love interest for Gervais, and while the two never quite click as a romantic match per se, the director knows when to cut and call it a day, establishing romance without ever ruining the moment. Leoni is always comfortable in her position and shares some humorous and touching interplay with her co-stars which further the scripts warm, humanist tones.\n\nIn the end I was pleasantly surprised by the time the credits rolled. Not just from the fact that I felt genuinely fulfilled by a straight forward comedy about ghosts, but that I was often moved by what was presented to me. Of course, Ghost Town, although largely a ghost movie by façade and pure premise, is actually far from such a movie. If anything, the real core here is always focused upon using the memories of those ghosts to create tangible, living breathing characters that feel emotionally resonating and of course, are side stitchingly funny. Sure enough it's over the top, silly and at times even a little tiresome, but in the end, such ideas are justified by the payoff and development of character that is established as a result. In this way Ghost Town achieves a sense of relevancy that most movies of the subgenre fail to reach, managing to speak to us through comedy and romance that comes together to create a feature that is simply good fun to watch. With an unforgettable performance by Gervais, and enough heat between characters to justify much of the film's otherwise ridiculous elements, Ghost Town is a surprise hit; charming, delightful and full of life.\n\n\n* A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72475,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-09-19","keywords":"slipping and falling,dog walking,new york city,slimehouse,ghost","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ghost Town: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3501196057","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bertram Pincus, is a man whose people skills leave much to be desired.

Of the latter in fact Elvis Costello and Natalie Cole in particular came off very well. My biggest beef, however, was with Sheryl Crow's performance of "Begin the Beguine." I haven't heard or read it commented upon so apparently it wasn't noticed that she didn't sing the melody nor did the arrangement follow the fairly complex chord structure that Cole Porter wrote. Taking liberties in jazz is one thing. It's common practice among jazz musicians to take interpretative flights far from the source material and yet still stay fairly close to the general structure and melodic line. In this travesty of a straight, non-jazz performance Ms. Crow quite simply didn't sing the tune as written and the arrangement fairly clobbered the carefully structured co-relation of major and minor chords, altered notes leading to secondary dominants and shifts of key and melody that lead to the tune's climax and denouement.

Of the latter in fact Elvis Costello and Natalie Cole in particular came off very well. My biggest beef, however, was with Sheryl Crow's performance of "Begin the Beguine." I haven't heard or read it commented upon so apparently it wasn't noticed that she didn't sing the melody nor did the arrangement follow the fairly complex chord structure that Cole Porter wrote. Taking liberties in jazz is one thing. It's common practice among jazz musicians to take interpretative flights far from the source material and yet still stay fairly close to the general structure and melodic line. In this travesty of a straight, non-jazz performance Ms. Crow quite simply didn't sing the tune as written and the arrangement fairly clobbered the carefully structured co-relation of major and minor chords, altered notes leading to secondary dominants and shifts of key and melody that lead to the tune's climax and denouement. I suppose it's some sort of comment on the general unfamiliarity with popular song of the golden age of Broadway in general and Cole Porter in particular that is to blame but it seems a pity that someone somewhere along the line didn't call her on this.

Ludicrous plot but just take the film in all its glory of silliness. These characters have so much potential to do much more.

The ending is especially good. \n\nRated PG-13; Violence and Profanity.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":531628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2002-09-18","keywords":"year 2054,future noir,neo noir,washington d.c.,psychic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Minority Report","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3333161241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0608090/","name":"Samantha Morton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

Every episode is about their petty jealousies of each other, their competition for the same boyfriends or girlfriends, and their complete violation of all the school rules.\n\nThese girls go to the Salvatore School, which is for teen vampires, werewolves, and witches. Unfortunately, Hope, Lizzie, and Josie are the lead characters. They are witches who act like big bee itches in every single episode. The constant bickering and snarky remarks between them makes this show hard to watch. The rest of the cast is made up of friendlier and nicer supernatural characters.\n\nThe weekly occult adventures are mostly for the sake of framing the constant drama and neurotic hate between Lizzie, Hope, and Josie. They usually manage to suck in at least one or two of the other students or the head master, so that every episode features the cast fighting each other and some monster from Malivore, which is a place full of evil creatures that want to cross over to Earth.\n\nThe episodes that do not focus on the nasty trio of big witches, Lizzie, Hope, and Josie, can be fun and entertaining.

Life is short. Life is painful. Life is rich. Life is....Precious.","reviewBody":"This is a film that might make some people a little uneasy. It deals with family abuse in the form of rape, physical and verbal violence. The one character it follows is Precious, an overweight illiterate teenage girl who is pregnant with her second child from her biological father. She is kicked out of her school because of her pregnancy and is enrolled in another educational institution called each one teach one. She wants to do better things, but doesn't have the will or motivation because of the constant abuse at the hands of her mother. She day dreams about being a big star and getting out of the hellish life she lives.\n\nThe film is raw with the material and doesn't really hold any punches. Lee Daniels second feature film shows vast improvement over the messy Shadowboxer starring Cuba good Jr. His grasp of the material and dedication to have the story be told is evident in his attention to translate the novel to screen. Daniels has put together a cast that care about the subject matter and the story as much as he does and is surrounded by the talent that is needed to pull it off. \n\nGabourey Sidibe is Precious, the troubled teen wanting more out of life. She shines in her first starring role and it's no walk in the park for her. The role demanded talent and Sidibe delivers what is needed. Of course the one who stands out the most is Mo'Nique earning herself a much deserved Oscar for her role as the abusive and sloth ridden mother. Her confrontation with her daughter after the birth of the second child is intense and will have you holding your breath in fear for the safety of the child. \n\nPrecious is a film that is driven by a strong story and an emotional cast that cares about the work they are doing. It's a glimmer of hope that keeps the story moving in a world that is hard edged and usually leads nowhere. It's not a relatively long film, but I did find myself checking my watch every now and then and some bits in the film happen without much clarification. Where did that one white boy come from in her Each One Teach One class? In any event, the final product is a good film with a message about hope and Tyler Perry finally has his name attached to something good in his career (Star Trek not included).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-11-20","keywords":"lesbian couple,lesbian,f rated,self narration,mother daughter conflict","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1522402585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTg2OTA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA3MDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTg2OTA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA3MDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Harlem, an overweight, illiterate teen (Sidibe) who is pregnant with her second child is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can head in a new direction."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2829737/","name":"Gabourey Sidibe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0594898/","name":"Mo'Nique"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745736/","name":"Paula Patton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200005/","name":"Lee Daniels"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048235/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0223834/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2819316/","name":"Geoffrey Fletcher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2497119/","name":"Sapphire"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And its indeed a santa that fulfills the little girls hopes and wishes, through love, violence, witt and magic, that only a christmas night break in burglar can do.\n\nThe film has a wonderful flow of visuals and auditorial heartbeat like rythm of sniper shots, and when the ''home alone'' feel has arrived you become like the child yourself, guessing and speculating what will happen next.\n\nIts an unusual x-mas treat for you ,if youll let it. It handles a lot of topics and issues connected to the ''family'' consept, and i guaratee that you will have a good laugh and loads of giggles. The caracter acts, especially by nicolas done by diego peretti is award worthy.\n\nJust mention that this is not an ''all family'' entertainment, there are violence that you wont show a 6yr old, but for all us grumpy old ones its a gold nugget to start the navidad in a felizious way.. a recommend pero...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2021-03-11","keywords":"three word title,thief,extramarital affair,unfaithful wife,cheating wife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1811202841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFiNWQ0YWMtMDE4OS00YTRkLTk2MjktZmE5MjdjODFlN2Q3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFiNWQ0YWMtMDE4OS00YTRkLTk2MjktZmE5MjdjODFlN2Q3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","description":"A peaceful Christmas Eve is interrupted when a thief breaks into a house.

And just let me add how much i admire the superb caracter actors in this quirky christmas movie.\n\nAnybody whos written a gift list and sent it to santa, will know the importance of those wishes . And its indeed a santa that fulfills the little girls hopes and wishes, through love, violence, witt and magic, that only a christmas night break in burglar can do.\n\nThe film has a wonderful flow of visuals and auditorial heartbeat like rythm of sniper shots, and when the ''home alone'' feel has arrived you become like the child yourself, guessing and speculating what will happen next.\n\nIts an unusual x-mas treat for you ,if youll let it. It handles a lot of topics and issues connected to the ''family'' consept, and i guaratee that you will have a good laugh and loads of giggles. The caracter acts, especially by nicolas done by diego peretti is award worthy.\n\nJust mention that this is not an ''all family'' entertainment, there are violence that you wont show a 6yr old, but for all us grumpy old ones its a gold nugget to start the navidad in a felizious way.. a recommend pero...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2021-03-11","keywords":"three word title,thief,extramarital affair,unfaithful wife,cheating wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1811202841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFiNWQ0YWMtMDE4OS00YTRkLTk2MjktZmE5MjdjODFlN2Q3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFiNWQ0YWMtMDE4OS00YTRkLTk2MjktZmE5MjdjODFlN2Q3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","description":"A peaceful Christmas Eve is interrupted when a thief breaks into a house.

And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody.

The best 3D to date","reviewBody":"Saw it today in a sneak preview today at the Director's Guild in LA. James Cameron who was there professed it's a masterpiece and the best 3D to date. And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":315454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-11-23","keywords":"cinema,automaton,clock,mechanical man,memory","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2781978137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in 1930s Paris, an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.

Lawrence plays FBI Agent Malcolm Turner who goes undercover as "Big Momma" Hattie Mae Pierce (Ella Mitchell), so as to hopefully snare escaped convict Lester Vesco (Howard). "Big Momma" is the aunt of Vesco's ex-wife, Sherry (Long), who is on her way to "Big Momma's" to hide out after hearing of Lester's escape.\n\nIn spite of baffling critics-and not finding many casual film viewers willing to say they enjoyed it! the film was a surprise hit and opened as the number two movie in North America. It went on to gross over $117 million at the box office and subsequently ensured that a sequel would follow down the line (it arrived in 2006). The film isn't pretending to be anything other than the mindless comedy it is. If viewed on those terms then it can be enjoyed. Sure some of the gags are puerile, and Lawrence is an acquired taste, tho his energy and comedy timing are first rate here. But it does work to a degree.

Lawrence plays FBI Agent Malcolm Turner who goes undercover as "Big Momma" Hattie Mae Pierce (Ella Mitchell), so as to hopefully snare escaped convict Lester Vesco (Howard). "Big Momma" is the aunt of Vesco's ex-wife, Sherry (Long), who is on her way to "Big Momma's" to hide out after hearing of Lester's escape.\n\nIn spite of baffling critics-and not finding many casual film viewers willing to say they enjoyed it! the film was a surprise hit and opened as the number two movie in North America. It went on to gross over $117 million at the box office and subsequently ensured that a sequel would follow down the line (it arrived in 2006). The film isn't pretending to be anything other than the mindless comedy it is. If viewed on those terms then it can be enjoyed. Sure some of the gags are puerile, and Lawrence is an acquired taste, tho his energy and comedy timing are first rate here. But it does work to a degree. It's been done better in the likes of Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire, and the plot, with it's boorish romantic strand, is merely an excuse for "Big Momma" to get into daft scrapes. Yet the action is nicely staged and the pace of the piece never sags.

There's no doubt the two have chemistry. What there is doubt about is how to perfectly utilise each of the two as characters. The problem is that for Wahlberg's confident, in-charge character (which he has to play) to work Ferrell needs to play the straight guy and that isn't when he's at his best. He does it well there's no doubt about it, but he's at his best when his character has an edge to him like 'Ron Burgundy' or his character in 'Step Brothers'. Playing the overly straight guy just seems almost a waste for the one Ferrell movie we get a year, even though no one could deny he still does it very well. \n\nThe difference in quality between this and 'Get Hard' is noticeable. There, Kevin Hart was unable to find a chemistry with Ferrell and it just turned into the two competing with each other trying to make the movie their own. Here that's not the case. Wahlberg seems happy to let Ferrell take the reins and is comfortable just doing what he does best, with his laid back, dry sense of humour accompanying Ferrell perfectly. \n\nThere are consistent laughs throughout, but perhaps not one stand out scene that will be memorable for years to come. It doesn't push the envelope as much as other Ferrell movies have in the past either. I really would love to see him always be given free rein to say and do as he pleases but also understand why that can't always be the case. If you're just looking to get your annual fix of a bit of Ferrell hilarity then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a game-changer, perhaps wait for the next one.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2015-12-30","keywords":"sweat,pull,pull ups,push,muscle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1706799641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM0NjMzMzAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQwMjExNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM0NjMzMzAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQwMjExNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A mild-mannered radio executive strives to become the best stepdad to his wife's two children, but complications ensue when their freewheeling and freeloading real father arrives, forcing him to compete for the affection of the kids."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002071/","name":"Will Ferrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004802/","name":"Linda Cardellini"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1890845/","name":"Sean Anders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0325207/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0186190/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0122602/","name":"Brian Burns"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1890845/","name":"Sean Anders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1898234/","name":"John Morris"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His best friend is an even bigger nerd than he is and not as brainy and of course he fancies one of the it girls, while his sister is being bullied by some others. Weston is a very good looking actor, so trying to pass him off as a science geek is really a bit of a stretch one of the films weakest flaws but one I was prepared to forgive. This group form an unlikely alliance when they discover via one of David's deceased Dad's experiments, they have invented time travel. They jump together and change various things in their recent past and also do some fairly typical teenage things like go and win the lottery.

It's helped by a reasonably good script which plays out like a good episode of the Twilight Zone but what really helps the film is the cast. Its pretty rare that a group of teenage actors should all be universally so good, but that is certainly the case here. Sofia Black-D'Elia who more recently starred in Born of War is especially good and one I predict big things for while Sam Lerner who plays the thankless role of the Annoying friend clearly has taken on board everything his actor father taught him. This really is a talented group of individuals. \n\nThe film reminded me of the 1980s cult film The Explorers and I found myself rooting for the hero towards the end because you wanted him to set everything right. I really enjoyed this film and stayed up really late when I was super tired to watch it. Thankfully I wasn't bored and I was with them until the end.

It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.\n\nIt feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.\n\nTarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.\n\nYet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of "ultra-violence," it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.\n\nAnd that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things.

The fact of the matter is that this film is fun and well made. \n\nTo get some negatives out of the way first, its definitely got a few obnoxious crude jokes. It also could have been a bit funnier at times. But overall it definitely put me in a good mood, especially because I'm a huge Will Ferrell and Danny McBride fan. I love how Wll Ferrell can deliver such ridiculous lines of dialogue with a straight face. \n\nDespite being a major Hollywood film, I felt like this film had heart to it and didn't really feel hollow.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage.

Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should "Hulk Smash" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up.

It's better than most of the other spy / thriller stuff out there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":133324,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-04-30","keywords":"recruit,training,watching tv,jefferson memorial,smithsonian institute","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Recruit","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi499253529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDlhYTM4ZWItOTE3OC00ZjVkLWI0OWMtOTUxZGIxMDljZGU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDlhYTM4ZWItOTE3OC00ZjVkLWI0OWMtOTUxZGIxMDljZGU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2 Post","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0166202/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870013/","name":"Roger Towne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322248/","name":"Mitch Glazer"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And neither have I seen it when I saw the much-praised sequel HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY. But that's just what I really like about this sequel: It doesn't require you to have seen the original to fully enjoy this weird and entertaining excursion. Seeing the original would certainly add to the experience, but taken in its own rights, HELLBOY II does what a sequel should do: Not just live up to the expectations left by its predecessor, but also shine as a stand-alone effort.\n\nAnd yet I have another confession: I have not seen Guillermo Del Toro's crown jewel PAN'S LABYRINTH yet. But seeing HELLBOY II, I am more than impressed by his wild imagination. HELLBOY may have been based on a comic book, but for anyone who isn't a fan of the comics, Hellboy is Del Toro's own creation. Like what Tim Burton did with BATMAN, Del Toro has modeled Hellboy (Ron Perlman) as his own creation on-screen, and he's a very interesting character. Perlman never wastes his opportunity to provide depth as well as nuance to his character. Perlman proves himself worthy, not just an ideal action hero (under tons of make-up), but as yet another actor who successfully embodies the role of a comic-book character.\n\nAs in PAN'S LABYRINTH, Del Toro populates the world of HELLBOY II with some truly fascinating and intriguing creatures. Roger Ebert made a truthful compliment by stating that the world of HELLBOY II reminded him of the famous Cantina scene from STAR WARS. What George Lucas has conceived within only a few minutes of screen time in his movie, Del Toro manages to do for 2 hours. The creatures are imaginative, not just in look but in personality, and they are at an abundance. Plus, they're also mostly done using make-up effects rather than CGI, which makes them all the more real. Add to Del Toro's imaginative set pieces, he is a master storyteller. From the opening scene, where "Broom" Bruttenholm (John Hurt) tells the legend of the "Golden Army" to a young Hellboy, Del Toro exhibits is true talents at telling a good story. There are moments of thrills and even laughs, and the visuals are superb. Supporting performances and some neat special effects (notice that I praised the CGI later in in this review) make for one worthy adventure ride. HELLBOY II isn't perfect, but it sure is great at what it was doing.\n\nRating: **** out of 5.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":264421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
