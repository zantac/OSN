Śledczy musi je rozszyfrować, aby odkryć tożsamość niebezpiecznego przestępcy. Wspiera go inspektor Crome (Rubert Grint). Trzymająca w napięciu adaptacja prozy mistrzyni gatunku - Agathy Christie - z nominowanym w karierze dwukrotnie do Oscara ("Miejsca w sercu", "Na linii ognia") Johnem Malkovichem.</desc>

He works in Dublin at his dad's Hoover Repair Centre. One day as he's playing on the street a Czech woman who sells roses and cleans houses comes up and starts to talk to him. She's somewhat cool but she's also disarmingly honest. The dialogue seems understated, offhand, but the words seem to come from the heart. She plays the piano (and later reveals she's written some songs herself) and they get together to make music. Both are suffering from love affairs that went wrong. He longs for her but she keeps her distance. The simplicity of the acting makes the characters seem real, like everything else in the movie. It doesn't try too hard. It trusts its material, and it works.\n\nThe recording session they wangle with a group of other buskers (two guitarists and a youthful drummer) is a metaphor for this whole film. These people know nothing about recording, but they've got good material and the initially skeptical engineer winds up acknowledging that they've made a beautiful thing.\n\nOnce's transitions are a little awkward sometimes and its images aren't fancy, but the story moves you without having any sentimental payoffs. Kitchen sink film-making: it works if you believe in what you're doing. And have something to work with. The core of Once is the music. It's what they have to work with. The studio recording session has the good feel of things coming together: it's so strong and uncalculated-feeling, it makes the studio scene in Craig Brewer's Hustle and Flow look self-conscious. In Once the sound of the music speaks without special need for dialogue or close-ups. The real love story of Once is the love of musicians playing together. Few movies perhaps have captured any better that warmth and pleasure of making music with others.\n\nPeople have said this is a musical. If so, it redefines the musical as some American musicals have done recently, especially Spring Awakening and Passing Strange. What makes the idea fly is that it's as if the young man and the young woman can't express what they feel for each other, and the only way they can get their emotions across is to burst into song. But the songs are their songs, not some composer's.

    <desc lang="pl">Sylwetka legendy kina i teatru. Margarethe von Trotta opowiada o dokonaniach szwedzkiego reżysera Ingmara Bergmana. Wnikliwie analizuje najważniejsze sceny z jego filmów, a także kluczowe wątki powtarzające się w całej twórczości autora dramatu "Siódma pieczęć". Von Trotta odnosi się także do miejsc ważnych dla biografii reżysera. W filmie głos zabierają również współpracownicy szwedzkiego mistrza oraz młodsze pokolenie filmowców, dla których dokonania Bergmana są stałym źródłem inspiracji.</desc>

The screenplay is by British writer Ian McEwan, adapting his own 2007 novella of the same name. The film stars multiple Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle - and was released one week after another literary adaptation, "The Seagull", in which the same two actors played young Russian lovers. This story follows two young Brits as they meet, fall in love and get married, focusing mainly on the wedding night.\n\nFlorence Pointing and Edward Mayhew have just been married and have arrived at a hotel at the titular beach for their honeymoon. Through an uncomfortable dinner in their room and awkward fumblings with their clothes, it becomes painfully clear that they are equally inexperienced and nervous regarding sex. As the evening slowly progresses, we see flashbacks of how their romance developed, with hints at what makes the prospect of sleeping together so uncomfortable for them - especially Florence. When things come to a head, the young marrieds have a seaside conservation which reveals much about who they are (and the era in which they live) and has very important consequences for the rest of their lives.\n\n"On Chesil Beach" is one of the most layered and most profound movies you are likely to see in 2018. Woven in with the development of the romance, the developments on the wedding night and the repercussions of all of it are themes of sexual repression, gender roles, class differences, pride, regret, communication, forgiveness and, of course, love and marriage. Some will say that not much happens in this film, but there is still a whole lot happenING. And through it all, the considerable acting chops of the two leads (bolstered by solid performances from multiple Oscar nominee Emily Watson, Anne-Marie Duff, Samuel West, Adrian Scarborough and Bebe Cave) make the characters exceedingly sympathetic and relevant. This is a very well-done film without much action, but with plenty to show all of us.

Thankfully there's no shot of 'The Gherkin' building which seems to have plagued all films set in London since around 2000.\n\nMost of the action (if thats the right word) takes place in around a derelict warehouse in/or around a Council estate. D takes Tom to this place in order to do some business but has other plans. Unfortunately this is were the films Stage origins let it down because, the film becomes wordy &amp; rather confined to this single location. The film is beautiful to look at, the DoP should be very proud of themselves. I saw the film in the company of a Film Director and that was a comment he agreed with. Look out for the final Crane shot at the end of the film which is just great..\n\nAs to the performances, there's a really great performance from Ashley Walters as D a Crack Addict/Hustler. IMHO it much more than the clichéd "Blackman Druggie" part British Black actors are asked to play. It's a really convincing turn as an addict up there with Willie Ross's Drunk Father in 'Rita, Sue and Bob Too' and Samuel L. Jackson's performance in 'Jungle Fever'. There's also a good performance from Andy Serkis as Hoodwink a Northern Irish hard man. Oh, look out for the girl who plays Hoodwinks girlfriend I think in the titles she's called 'Pregnant Girl'. She's in the film for no more than 5 - 6 minutes tops but there's something really striking about her. \n\nI must admit I was expecting something different but that said, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is much better than say other films set in London with Urban theme's like 'Breaking and Entering'. A film well worth having a look at when or if it gets a UK Theatrical release.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-08-24","keywords":"bully,beating,male full back nudity,bare butt,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sugarhouse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2882863897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDA2Mjg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzNTMyMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDA2Mjg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzNTMyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Movie Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533599/","name":"Steven Mackintosh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910180/","name":"Ashley Walters"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0522327/","name":"Gary Love"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009090/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0187060/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2364947/","name":"Dominic Leyton"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully there's no shot of 'The Gherkin' building which seems to have plagued all films set in London since around 2000.\n\nMost of the action (if thats the right word) takes place in around a derelict warehouse in/or around a Council estate. D takes Tom to this place in order to do some business but has other plans. Unfortunately this is were the films Stage origins let it down because, the film becomes wordy &amp; rather confined to this single location. The film is beautiful to look at, the DoP should be very proud of themselves. I saw the film in the company of a Film Director and that was a comment he agreed with. Look out for the final Crane shot at the end of the film which is just great..\n\nAs to the performances, there's a really great performance from Ashley Walters as D a Crack Addict/Hustler. IMHO it much more than the clichéd "Blackman Druggie" part British Black actors are asked to play. It's a really convincing turn as an addict up there with Willie Ross's Drunk Father in 'Rita, Sue and Bob Too' and Samuel L. Jackson's performance in 'Jungle Fever'. There's also a good performance from Andy Serkis as Hoodwink a Northern Irish hard man. Oh, look out for the girl who plays Hoodwinks girlfriend I think in the titles she's called 'Pregnant Girl'. She's in the film for no more than 5 - 6 minutes tops but there's something really striking about her. \n\nI must admit I was expecting something different but that said, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is much better than say other films set in London with Urban theme's like 'Breaking and Entering'. A film well worth having a look at when or if it gets a UK Theatrical release.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-08-24","keywords":"bully,beating,male full back nudity,bare butt,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sugarhouse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2882863897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDA2Mjg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzNTMyMg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDA2Mjg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzNTMyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Movie Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533599/","name":"Steven Mackintosh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910180/","name":"Ashley Walters","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0522327/","name":"Gary Love"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009090/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0187060/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2364947/","name":"Dominic Leyton"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is what happened and this is how the people involved experienced it. The acting is fantastic, the way the scenes flow and the cinematography is excellent.

I think Simone did a fantastic job with this story. She kept to the actual events of what happened to Rachel, her family, friends as well as Caroline without glorifying it, sugar coating it and hollywoodising it. It is real and it is raw. This is what happened and this is how the people involved experienced it. The acting is fantastic, the way the scenes flow and the cinematography is excellent. Along with the true story there are messages to take from it, one being involved and recognizing mental illness, as we know is a massive and growing problem in the community.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4878,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"keywords":"missing person,fat girl,obsession,woman murders a woman,young murderer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Her Skin","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1286642969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzU5NDAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI4NDA2NA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzU5NDAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI4NDA2NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Consumed with self-loathing, nineteen-year-old Caroline covets, stalks, abducts then murders fifteen-year-old Rachel Barber whom she considers "perfect"; everything she is not: beautiful, self-assured, happy.

Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike "Taken," "Unknown" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.\n\nIn short, "Unknown" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography—I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation.

Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike "Taken," "Unknown" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.\n\nIn short, "Unknown" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography—I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. It is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":255393,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-03-23","keywords":"amnesia,coma,airport,scientist,nurse","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unknown: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1552980505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4NjYwMDYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4NjYwMDYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him.

Some alien space bacteria comes to earth on a crashed satellite - courtesy of those pesky Russians and in a scene similar to THE BLOB - and has the ability to 'control' metal, shortly animating a random giant robot that just so happens to be hanging around in a scrapyard. What follows is a rampage of destruction.\n\nThe problem with this film is that it's all very family friendly and therefore not at all menacing.

Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike "Taken," "Unknown" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.\n\nIn short, "Unknown" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography—I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. It is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":255393,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-03-23","keywords":"amnesia,coma,airport,scientist,nurse","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unknown: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1552980505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4NjYwMDYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4NjYwMDYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him.

Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio's financial difficulties, Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself, unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability, and while Stir Of Echoes had this, the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax write-off for that year.\n\nI have not read the novel by Richard Matheson, so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more big-name competitor, at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era, thus saving a few dollars, since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact, the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap, since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed, Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make, according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.\n\nKevin Bacon is in fine, fine form as the film's central hero, a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife, Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sister-in-law, Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope. After the pretender, that pile of sachaarine garbage called The Sixth Sense, child stars had such a bad reputation that Zachary deserves a medal for portraying such a genuinely likable, layered character. Indeed, director David Koepp took one hell of a risk by placing so much of the responsibility for the plot on his shoulders. That it pays off is a testament not only to the strength of Zachary David Cope's performance, but to the strength of the material he was given. Indeed, all the best scenes in Stir Of Echoes involve interaction between Zachary, Kathryn, and Kevin.\n\nI do think this film has its faults. Chief among them is that the story needed another ten minutes to properly develop. Plot threads like the group of psychics, a member of which helps put Kathryn Erbe's character on the path of greater understanding, needed better resolution. One moment, Maggie is asking this policeman why her husband is obsessed with a scene of memories to the exclusion of his job. The next moment, not only are details like the job forgotten, so too is the group and the policeman. Smoothing out intricate plot points such as this would have helped the story no end.\n\nIn the end, however, Stir Of Echoes is proof that the artistic work one does not hear about may just be the one that has more merit. If nothing else, it is worth watching to see a small ensemble cast that excels. Even small performances like Liza Weil's demonstrate a sense of dramatic flair that has long fled most of the rest of Hollywood. It is for this reason that I gave Stir Of Echoes an eight out of ten. It is worth watching just to see how badly misdirected the hype machine often is.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":78590,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-09-10","keywords":"hypnosis,seeing a ghost,missing person,psychic power,haunted house","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stir of Echoes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1653276953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAyMjM3ODEtYzA4Yi00NGM0LWI5YzctYWYwNTIxMDg5YWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAyMjM3ODEtYzA4Yi00NGM0LWI5YzctYWYwNTIxMDg5YWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178574/","name":"Zachary David Cope"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002062/","name":"Kathryn Erbe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558577/","name":"Richard Matheson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people.

Not in the fist!","reviewBody":"Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!\n\nFatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.\n\nI remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.\n\nThe stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very naïve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.\n\nOther stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.\n\nThe bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree, considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives, I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves, but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid, then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.\n\nThe Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel, most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything, yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone, that fighting is the last option for any situation, whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true, as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties, again this movie shows this to be so true.\n\nIn conclusion, the Karate Kid is a truly great film, but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate, as it is a very Chinese practice, but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches, that is for self-defence, and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie, because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story, but not to matter, if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option, then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!\n\nCMRS gives 'The Karate Kid': 5 (Brilliant Film)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1984-06-22","keywords":"karate,teenager,training,martial arts,bonsai","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Karate Kid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi813087257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001552/","name":"Pat Morita"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

Not in the fist!","reviewBody":"Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!\n\nFatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.\n\nI remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.\n\nThe stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very naïve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.\n\nOther stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.\n\nThe bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree, considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives, I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves, but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid, then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.\n\nThe Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel, most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything, yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone, that fighting is the last option for any situation, whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true, as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties, again this movie shows this to be so true.\n\nIn conclusion, the Karate Kid is a truly great film, but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate, as it is a very Chinese practice, but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches, that is for self-defence, and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie, because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story, but not to matter, if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option, then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!\n\nCMRS gives 'The Karate Kid': 5 (Brilliant Film)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1984-06-22","keywords":"karate,teenager,training,martial arts,bonsai","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Karate Kid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi813087257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001552/","name":"Pat Morita","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).\n\nI enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.\n\nI don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.\n\nLet's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a "Jekyll and Hyde"-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).\n\nI enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.\n\nI don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.\n\nLet's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a "Jekyll and Hyde"-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not in the fist!","reviewBody":"Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!\n\nFatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.\n\nI remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.\n\nThe stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very naïve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.\n\nOther stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.\n\nThe bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid.

However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone, that fighting is the last option for any situation, whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true, as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties, again this movie shows this to be so true.\n\nIn conclusion, the Karate Kid is a truly great film, but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate, as it is a very Chinese practice, but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches, that is for self-defence, and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie, because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story, but not to matter, if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option, then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!\n\nCMRS gives 'The Karate Kid': 5 (Brilliant Film)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1984-06-22","keywords":"karate,teenager,training,martial arts,bonsai","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Karate Kid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi813087257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001552/","name":"Pat Morita"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

Not in the fist!","reviewBody":"Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!\n\nFatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.\n\nI remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.\n\nThe stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very naïve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.\n\nOther stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.\n\nThe bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree, considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives, I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves, but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid, then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.\n\nThe Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel, most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything, yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun! This is entertainment, after all.

This helps the film because really this is not something that tries to have something for everyone so much as it is a film that knows the target audience and is determined to give them what they want. As a result, the story here is a simple affair of a criminal scarred by the Punisher, going out for revenge while the police are after both of them  it is not the most complex bit of writing you'll ever see but then, it doesn't need to be. Those looking for the Punisher's dark tone to be utilised to try and make this character into a possible "Batman" in regards having a dark psyche at the core of it will be disappointed because the film does no such thing. I was one of these people though and I was at least hoping that more would be made of the rage and loss inside Castle  but again, a few flashbacks aside, he generally just broods around the place full of vengeful justice.\n\nWhat carries the film then is a series of brutal action sequences and effects shots, all full of callous violence, macho posturing and gun play that rewrites all rules of the real world. At this point it does depend what you are looking for because there are a core of viewers will love the film for this as it delivers exploded head after collapsing face after dismembering and other really graphic acts. For me personally the overdose on excess is all too much and it does leave the film with this very unpleasant air that makes it harder to enjoy. If the violence was a little less graphic or frequently graphic then it would have been easier to actually "enjoy" the big action sequences for what they were, rather than the gore putting me off  although again for some this will be the cherry on the cake. To the casual viewer this excess does give the film an exploitative, careless edge, where all the characters are little more than things waiting to explode and it limits how much we care  not just about the goons but also the main characters.\n\nThis further detracts from the dark character of Castle as he becomes just a machine and not a man or even a shadow of a man  and no, staring off moodily into the distance every now and again is not the same thing. At the same time it also limits the more flamboyant and silly side of the film  the side that the hammy Jigsaw needed to play up. You can see it in the excess but also in the Patton reference and other silly things; all of these imply that it should be a little bit camp with the darkness (hence making it a bit more fun and accessible) but it doesn't do this and those that play to this side of it are left just looking silly in a bad way rather than a good way.\n\nSpecifically West suffers from this as his comic book villain is lost in the sea of gore. As a Wire fan I do feel a bit for West but his Italian impersonation at the start is awful and, once behind the make-up he can do little but be "a bad man" without much unique about him to make him notable for anything other than what he has done before. Stevenson is not "good" either but he matches the ambition of the film and makes for a big dark presence  which is all the material needs and this he does well. I quite liked Salmon in it because he is one of the few that feels natural  which is a bit of a condemnation on everyone else when you think about Salmon's range generally. Hutchinson matches West by overplaying but again the sense of comic book madness is taken away by the gore.\n\nPunisher War Zone is a basic genre film then. For target audience it will satisfy as it delivers simple characters with simple motivations, a straight-forward plot with lots of action and lots of gore  boxes ticked. However for many casual viewers it will be all too dark and unpleasant as the gore dominates and it makes everything seem a bit less "entertaining" and a lot more like work. The dark tone to the character and the hammy silliness of the villains are lost and the entire film appears to be about exploding heads  great if that is your thing but not so great if not. A noisy Saturday night special with your male friends  but that's all it is."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-17","keywords":"song during end credits,rock soundtrack,exploding body,frank castle character,the punisher character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Punisher: War Zone -- Theatrical Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi65536281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYyMTYzMjAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk2NDQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYyMTYzMjAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk2NDQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Punisher: War Zone, directed by Lexi Alexander."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829032/","name":"Ray Stevenson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922035/","name":"Dominic West"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004748/","name":"Julie Benz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591994/","name":"Lexi Alexander"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255123/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1238801/","name":"Nick Santora"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1436466/","name":"Art Marcum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0391344/","name":"Matt Holloway"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I can't get it out of my mind for a variety of reasons....First of all, I was very impressed with the quality of the costumes. I don't know much about the 60s but the outfits everyone wore looked pretty authentic. The music went well and set the mood well! The props matched the outfits and made me believe I was back in that time period! I also believe the actors and actresses worked very well together and had great chemistry! Does it have flaws? Sure..what first episode is completely 100% perfect? It had some good twists and I can't wait to get to know the characters better. True some of the characters don't have much of a background yet...but they touched on a few....I'm definitely going to keep watching!!!!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19446,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-25","keywords":"passenger plane,airliner,uniform,airline employee,airport","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1134612/","name":"Michael Mosley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355546/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052395/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0401584/","name":"Nancy Hult Ganis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650202/","name":"Jack Orman"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pan Am: Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3471359257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZiMzUxMTAtMDYxYS00ZmE5LWFmNjEtZDczODdkNGQ5ODgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZiMzUxMTAtMDYxYS00ZmE5LWFmNjEtZDczODdkNGQ5ODgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pan Am: Season 1"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's one of top 5 best actor of our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it was, but not that great.\n\nWhat he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with the wonderful director.\n\nIt was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts, but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.\n\nI think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a weird person, so you would easily get it.

He's one of top 5 best actor of our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it was, but not that great.\n\nWhat he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with the wonderful director.\n\nIt was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts, but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.\n\nI think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a weird person, so you would easily get it. You must need to be a patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for Gyllenhaal alone.

It's a tidy, well made film that draws you into a family battling the mental illness of the mother, who believes she is a sentient android who has malfunctioned. But maybe she is a human who has constructed an elaborate backstory to hide from the pain of being a person who cannot love and who cannot stop beating her on-the-cusp of manhood son. The material clues suggest we are in our time, not some future echoing the television series "Humans," but we are looking at the world through the eyes of the narrator, the mother, and she sees clues about her android origin everywhere. By the time the movie reaches its conclusion, you've been drawn into the madness, the uncertainty of what is human, what is programming, and profound discomfort for the mom and her interior life. The dedication at the end of the film makes it clear the filmmaker wanted to share his experience with his mother and her struggle. He succeeded. The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters. The actors all do a fine job, particularly Marta Krol in the role of the mother and Marieta Zukowska as her peer, counterpart, alter ego or therapist -- when you are in psychosis, those around you play many roles.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067989/","name":"Marta Król"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2029225/","name":"Marcin Sztabinski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2346424/","name":"Marieta Zukowska"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0734708/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0767135/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0778711/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"}],"duration":"PT1H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a tidy, well made film that draws you into a family battling the mental illness of the mother, who believes she is a sentient android who has malfunctioned. But maybe she is a human who has constructed an elaborate backstory to hide from the pain of being a person who cannot love and who cannot stop beating her on-the-cusp of manhood son. The material clues suggest we are in our time, not some future echoing the television series "Humans," but we are looking at the world through the eyes of the narrator, the mother, and she sees clues about her android origin everywhere. By the time the movie reaches its conclusion, you've been drawn into the madness, the uncertainty of what is human, what is programming, and profound discomfort for the mom and her interior life. The dedication at the end of the film makes it clear the filmmaker wanted to share his experience with his mother and her struggle. He succeeded. The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters. The actors all do a fine job, particularly Marta Krol in the role of the mother and Marieta Zukowska as her peer, counterpart, alter ego or therapist -- when you are in psychosis, those around you play many roles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067989/","name":"Marta Król","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2029225/","name":"Marcin Sztabinski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2346424/","name":"Marieta Zukowska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0734708/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0767135/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0778711/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

(or should go to)... "Dame Emma Thompson".","reviewBody":"Judge Maye (Thompson) is a childless wife to her loving husband Jack (Tucci), but is also a workaholic. This is driving the long-term couple to the point of infidelity: a fact the ever-focused Fiona - whose life, to her, probably feels to be in a perfect if selfish equilibrium - is oblivious to. With Fiona's intense but comfortable world about to cave in around her, her increasing stress is not helped by the latest case she is working on: one where Adam ( Fionn Whitehead from "Dunkirk"), a Jehovah's Witness boy and a minor, is refusing on religious grounds the blood transfusion he desperately needs to fight his lukaemia. Fiona's decisions in the months ahead go much further than a simple judgement on the case.\n\nTwo acting giants - one born in London; one born in New York - tower over this Ian McEwan adaptation like leviathons. I bandy around the phrase "national treasure" a lot in my reviews, but here Emma Thompson is simply breathtakingly powerful in the lead role of Judge Fiona Maye, exhibiting such extremes of emotion that you would like to think that an Oscar nomination would be assured. (However, before I run out and put a £10 bet on her to win, the film is such a small British film that unfortunately both a nomination and a win seem unlikely! THIS IS A CRIME! Please share and lobby people, lobby! Perhaps at the very least we can hope for some BAFTA recognition). \n\nSometimes a masterly lead performance can make a co-star performance seem unbalanced, but no such danger here. Stanley Tucci makes a perfect acting foil for Thompson: if he were a wine he would be described as "exasperation, frustration, compassion with strong notes of respect". And he carries it off with perfection.\n\nThis is an incredibly intelligent film, working on so many different levels and subject to so much interpretation. Fiona's feelings for the troubled teenager feel more maternal than sexual, but when those feelings become returned and escalate the whole piece develops a queasily oedipal quality. Many films have focused on illicit attractions between teacher and pupil, but here lies a new variation, with Maye fighting against her best professional insticts to 'do the right thing'. "I'm frightened of myself" she eventually wails to a colleague. \n\nIn his opening hospital scenes, (not withstanding the comic similarities between the guitar scene here and a certain scene in "Airplane"!), Adam seems completely other-wordly compared to a typical teen and this comes across as utterly false. That is, until you consider the oddness of his family background and Jehovah's Witness upbringing. As such, the film just about gets away with it. Whitehead does a good job with a difficult role. \n\nIf you've been in a court, you'll know that there is something regal and magical about a judge in full regalia entering a packed courtroom. So it's unusual to see the view from the other side of the door... a non-descript office corridor and a non-descript door. Helping the judge on this side of the door is her PA Nigel, played by the brilliant Jason Watkins: a TV regular (e.g. "Line of Duty", "W1A") but seen far less at the movies. \n\nAs a story of obsessive fixation, it borders on McEwan's disturbing earlier work "Enduring Love". And it has the potential to go in lots of interesting directions as a sort of bonkers platonic love triangle ("He wants to live with US?" splutters Tucci). Where the story does end up going was not particularly to my liking, and a melodramatic concert scene was - for me - a little overdone. However it does give rise to a scene (the 'sopping wet' scene) that shows Thompson at her most brilliant: if she DID get Oscar or BAFTA nominated then this will be her pre-announcement snippet.\n\nIt's a great film for showcasing acting talent, but beware: it's short on laughs, not remotely uplifting and takes a while to mentally recover from!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-08-24","keywords":"female judge,husband wife relationship,teenage boy,teenager,17 year old","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677390105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As her marriage to Jack (Stanley Tucci) flounders, eminent High Court judge Fiona Maye (Emma Thompson) has a life-changing decision to make at work - should she force a teenage boy, Adam (Fionn Whitehead), to have the blood transfusion that will save his life?

(or should go to)... "Dame Emma Thompson".","reviewBody":"Judge Maye (Thompson) is a childless wife to her loving husband Jack (Tucci), but is also a workaholic. This is driving the long-term couple to the point of infidelity: a fact the ever-focused Fiona - whose life, to her, probably feels to be in a perfect if selfish equilibrium - is oblivious to. With Fiona's intense but comfortable world about to cave in around her, her increasing stress is not helped by the latest case she is working on: one where Adam ( Fionn Whitehead from "Dunkirk"), a Jehovah's Witness boy and a minor, is refusing on religious grounds the blood transfusion he desperately needs to fight his lukaemia. Fiona's decisions in the months ahead go much further than a simple judgement on the case.\n\nTwo acting giants - one born in London; one born in New York - tower over this Ian McEwan adaptation like leviathons. I bandy around the phrase "national treasure" a lot in my reviews, but here Emma Thompson is simply breathtakingly powerful in the lead role of Judge Fiona Maye, exhibiting such extremes of emotion that you would like to think that an Oscar nomination would be assured. (However, before I run out and put a £10 bet on her to win, the film is such a small British film that unfortunately both a nomination and a win seem unlikely! THIS IS A CRIME! Please share and lobby people, lobby! Perhaps at the very least we can hope for some BAFTA recognition). \n\nSometimes a masterly lead performance can make a co-star performance seem unbalanced, but no such danger here. Stanley Tucci makes a perfect acting foil for Thompson: if he were a wine he would be described as "exasperation, frustration, compassion with strong notes of respect". And he carries it off with perfection.\n\nThis is an incredibly intelligent film, working on so many different levels and subject to so much interpretation. Fiona's feelings for the troubled teenager feel more maternal than sexual, but when those feelings become returned and escalate the whole piece develops a queasily oedipal quality. Many films have focused on illicit attractions between teacher and pupil, but here lies a new variation, with Maye fighting against her best professional insticts to 'do the right thing'. "I'm frightened of myself" she eventually wails to a colleague. \n\nIn his opening hospital scenes, (not withstanding the comic similarities between the guitar scene here and a certain scene in "Airplane"!), Adam seems completely other-wordly compared to a typical teen and this comes across as utterly false. That is, until you consider the oddness of his family background and Jehovah's Witness upbringing. As such, the film just about gets away with it. Whitehead does a good job with a difficult role. \n\nIf you've been in a court, you'll know that there is something regal and magical about a judge in full regalia entering a packed courtroom.

Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse "The Monuments Men" with last November's "Last Vegas."'\n\n"The Monuments Men" boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, "The Monuments Men" deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.\n\nGeorge Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until "The Monuments Men." His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with "The Ides of March" and "Good Night, and Good Luck." He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.\n\nThe difficulty of "The Monuments Men" is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for "The Monuments Men." The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.\n\nWith those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of "The Monuments Men." Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in "Blue Jasmine," Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in "The Monuments Men" is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.\n\n"The Monuments Men" wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt. Clooney attempts to force sentiment on his audience, but it is unearned and unwanted. "The Monuments Men" was originally set to release last December (a fitting release for pushing films in the Oscar race), but was moved to an alternative February.

Britt Robertson was nicely cast as Sophia, except I have to admit here that I kept seeing a young Renee Zellweger in the part– before the silly plastic surgery turned her into a total stranger.

Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse "The Monuments Men" with last November's "Last Vegas."'\n\n"The Monuments Men" boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, "The Monuments Men" deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.\n\nGeorge Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until "The Monuments Men." His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with "The Ides of March" and "Good Night, and Good Luck." He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.\n\nThe difficulty of "The Monuments Men" is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for "The Monuments Men." The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.\n\nWith those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of "The Monuments Men." Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in "Blue Jasmine," Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in "The Monuments Men" is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.\n\n"The Monuments Men" wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt. Clooney attempts to force sentiment on his audience, but it is unearned and unwanted. "The Monuments Men" was originally set to release last December (a fitting release for pushing films in the Oscar race), but was moved to an alternative February.

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic. In fact, as the opening titles state, the film is dedicated to "my sister, who made me sit on top of the wardrobe".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic. In fact, as the opening titles state, the film is dedicated to "my sister, who made me sit on top of the wardrobe".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you're a fan of Hitchcock and Psycho though, don't get your hopes up too high.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":73947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-12-14","keywords":"year 1959,1950s,los angeles california,studio executive,censorship board","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2501551129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A love story between influential filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock and wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho in 1959.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000545/","name":"Helen Mirren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424060/","name":"Scarlett Johansson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0315065/","name":"Sacha Gervasi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199880/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572352/","name":"John J.

According to inequality org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst the poorest 64% of the population control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the milieu of Greed, a hilarious satire from prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom. Examining how the rich get richer, the film focuses on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, Greed doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\n\nSir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan) is one of Britain's richest men. The perma-tanned "self-made" billionaire is the owner of several clothing chains and is known as "the King of the High Street", although a less complimentary nickname is "Greedy" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts 1) his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping and the importance of using foreign sweatshops; 2) in the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains; and, 3) in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash - complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion. Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction - it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and his ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher) are still in love with one another is a theme which never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\n\nFor better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before, and Greed is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people. However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis.

Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction - it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and his ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher) are still in love with one another is a theme which never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\n\nFor better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before, and Greed is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people. However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis. For 30 years he has ruled the world of retail fashion – bringing the high street to the catwalk and the catwalk to the high street – but after a damaging public inquiry, his image is tarnished. To save his reputation, he decides to bounce back with a highly publicized and extravagant party celebrating his 60th birthday on the Greek island of Mykonos.

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

    <title lang="pl">Miasta rytm: Zrabowane dzieła sztuki</title>
    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

The dedication at the end of the film makes it clear the filmmaker wanted to share his experience with his mother and her struggle. He succeeded. The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters.

The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters. The actors all do a fine job, particularly Marta Krol in the role of the mother and Marieta Zukowska as her peer, counterpart, alter ego or therapist -- when you are in psychosis, those around you play many roles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067989/","name":"Marta Król","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2029225/","name":"Marcin Sztabinski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2346424/","name":"Marieta Zukowska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0734708/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0767135/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0778711/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

From the 3rd episode I liked the film, although it contains some unnecessary scenes with dying fish. The characters are played well (could'nt see it in french), the ambient is only a little creepy, the music is present but not annoying and after episode 3 I wanted so see episode 4 and so on. I do not regret to spend 5 hours viewing. For me, it's another interpretation of perhaps the best crime novel ever. It's worth looking at.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"genre":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-10-20","keywords":"tv mini series,three word series title,number 10 in series title,agatha christie,island","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494078/","name":"Samuel Le Bihan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001960/","name":"Romane Bohringer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0219099/","name":"Marianne Denicourt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073298/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

(or should go to)... "Dame Emma Thompson".","reviewBody":"Judge Maye (Thompson) is a childless wife to her loving husband Jack (Tucci), but is also a workaholic. This is driving the long-term couple to the point of infidelity: a fact the ever-focused Fiona - whose life, to her, probably feels to be in a perfect if selfish equilibrium - is oblivious to. With Fiona's intense but comfortable world about to cave in around her, her increasing stress is not helped by the latest case she is working on: one where Adam ( Fionn Whitehead from "Dunkirk"), a Jehovah's Witness boy and a minor, is refusing on religious grounds the blood transfusion he desperately needs to fight his lukaemia. Fiona's decisions in the months ahead go much further than a simple judgement on the case.\n\nTwo acting giants - one born in London; one born in New York - tower over this Ian McEwan adaptation like leviathons. I bandy around the phrase "national treasure" a lot in my reviews, but here Emma Thompson is simply breathtakingly powerful in the lead role of Judge Fiona Maye, exhibiting such extremes of emotion that you would like to think that an Oscar nomination would be assured. (However, before I run out and put a £10 bet on her to win, the film is such a small British film that unfortunately both a nomination and a win seem unlikely! THIS IS A CRIME! Please share and lobby people, lobby! Perhaps at the very least we can hope for some BAFTA recognition). \n\nSometimes a masterly lead performance can make a co-star performance seem unbalanced, but no such danger here. Stanley Tucci makes a perfect acting foil for Thompson: if he were a wine he would be described as "exasperation, frustration, compassion with strong notes of respect". And he carries it off with perfection.\n\nThis is an incredibly intelligent film, working on so many different levels and subject to so much interpretation. Fiona's feelings for the troubled teenager feel more maternal than sexual, but when those feelings become returned and escalate the whole piece develops a queasily oedipal quality. Many films have focused on illicit attractions between teacher and pupil, but here lies a new variation, with Maye fighting against her best professional insticts to 'do the right thing'. "I'm frightened of myself" she eventually wails to a colleague. \n\nIn his opening hospital scenes, (not withstanding the comic similarities between the guitar scene here and a certain scene in "Airplane"!), Adam seems completely other-wordly compared to a typical teen and this comes across as utterly false. That is, until you consider the oddness of his family background and Jehovah's Witness upbringing. As such, the film just about gets away with it. Whitehead does a good job with a difficult role. \n\nIf you've been in a court, you'll know that there is something regal and magical about a judge in full regalia entering a packed courtroom. So it's unusual to see the view from the other side of the door... a non-descript office corridor and a non-descript door. Helping the judge on this side of the door is her PA Nigel, played by the brilliant Jason Watkins: a TV regular (e.g. "Line of Duty", "W1A") but seen far less at the movies. \n\nAs a story of obsessive fixation, it borders on McEwan's disturbing earlier work "Enduring Love". And it has the potential to go in lots of interesting directions as a sort of bonkers platonic love triangle ("He wants to live with US?" splutters Tucci). Where the story does end up going was not particularly to my liking, and a melodramatic concert scene was - for me - a little overdone. However it does give rise to a scene (the 'sopping wet' scene) that shows Thompson at her most brilliant: if she DID get Oscar or BAFTA nominated then this will be her pre-announcement snippet.\n\nIt's a great film for showcasing acting talent, but beware: it's short on laughs, not remotely uplifting and takes a while to mentally recover from!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-08-24","keywords":"female judge,husband wife relationship,teenage boy,teenager,17 year old","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677390105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As her marriage to Jack (Stanley Tucci) flounders, eminent High Court judge Fiona Maye (Emma Thompson) has a life-changing decision to make at work - should she force a teenage boy, Adam (Fionn Whitehead), to have the blood transfusion that will save his life?

(or should go to)... "Dame Emma Thompson".","reviewBody":"Judge Maye (Thompson) is a childless wife to her loving husband Jack (Tucci), but is also a workaholic. This is driving the long-term couple to the point of infidelity: a fact the ever-focused Fiona - whose life, to her, probably feels to be in a perfect if selfish equilibrium - is oblivious to. With Fiona's intense but comfortable world about to cave in around her, her increasing stress is not helped by the latest case she is working on: one where Adam ( Fionn Whitehead from "Dunkirk"), a Jehovah's Witness boy and a minor, is refusing on religious grounds the blood transfusion he desperately needs to fight his lukaemia. Fiona's decisions in the months ahead go much further than a simple judgement on the case.\n\nTwo acting giants - one born in London; one born in New York - tower over this Ian McEwan adaptation like leviathons. I bandy around the phrase "national treasure" a lot in my reviews, but here Emma Thompson is simply breathtakingly powerful in the lead role of Judge Fiona Maye, exhibiting such extremes of emotion that you would like to think that an Oscar nomination would be assured. (However, before I run out and put a £10 bet on her to win, the film is such a small British film that unfortunately both a nomination and a win seem unlikely! THIS IS A CRIME! Please share and lobby people, lobby! Perhaps at the very least we can hope for some BAFTA recognition). \n\nSometimes a masterly lead performance can make a co-star performance seem unbalanced, but no such danger here. Stanley Tucci makes a perfect acting foil for Thompson: if he were a wine he would be described as "exasperation, frustration, compassion with strong notes of respect". And he carries it off with perfection.\n\nThis is an incredibly intelligent film, working on so many different levels and subject to so much interpretation. Fiona's feelings for the troubled teenager feel more maternal than sexual, but when those feelings become returned and escalate the whole piece develops a queasily oedipal quality. Many films have focused on illicit attractions between teacher and pupil, but here lies a new variation, with Maye fighting against her best professional insticts to 'do the right thing'. "I'm frightened of myself" she eventually wails to a colleague. \n\nIn his opening hospital scenes, (not withstanding the comic similarities between the guitar scene here and a certain scene in "Airplane"!), Adam seems completely other-wordly compared to a typical teen and this comes across as utterly false. That is, until you consider the oddness of his family background and Jehovah's Witness upbringing. As such, the film just about gets away with it. Whitehead does a good job with a difficult role. \n\nIf you've been in a court, you'll know that there is something regal and magical about a judge in full regalia entering a packed courtroom. So it's unusual to see the view from the other side of the door... a non-descript office corridor and a non-descript door. Helping the judge on this side of the door is her PA Nigel, played by the brilliant Jason Watkins: a TV regular (e.g. "Line of Duty", "W1A") but seen far less at the movies. \n\nAs a story of obsessive fixation, it borders on McEwan's disturbing earlier work "Enduring Love". And it has the potential to go in lots of interesting directions as a sort of bonkers platonic love triangle ("He wants to live with US?" splutters Tucci). Where the story does end up going was not particularly to my liking, and a melodramatic concert scene was - for me - a little overdone. However it does give rise to a scene (the 'sopping wet' scene) that shows Thompson at her most brilliant: if she DID get Oscar or BAFTA nominated then this will be her pre-announcement snippet.\n\nIt's a great film for showcasing acting talent, but beware: it's short on laughs, not remotely uplifting and takes a while to mentally recover from!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-08-24","keywords":"female judge,husband wife relationship,teenage boy,teenager,17 year old","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677390105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As her marriage to Jack (Stanley Tucci) flounders, eminent High Court judge Fiona Maye (Emma Thompson) has a life-changing decision to make at work - should she force a teenage boy, Adam (Fionn Whitehead), to have the blood transfusion that will save his life?

Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse "The Monuments Men" with last November's "Last Vegas."'\n\n"The Monuments Men" boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, "The Monuments Men" deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.\n\nGeorge Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until "The Monuments Men." His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with "The Ides of March" and "Good Night, and Good Luck." He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.\n\nThe difficulty of "The Monuments Men" is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for "The Monuments Men." The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.\n\nWith those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of "The Monuments Men." Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in "Blue Jasmine," Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in "The Monuments Men" is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.\n\n"The Monuments Men" wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt. Clooney attempts to force sentiment on his audience, but it is unearned and unwanted. "The Monuments Men" was originally set to release last December (a fitting release for pushing films in the Oscar race), but was moved to an alternative February.

To sum it up, this is a nicely done film and one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":79481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2015-04-15","keywords":"usa,united states,college student,college,bull riding","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2592911641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NTkwODY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwOTQ4NDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NTkwODY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwOTQ4NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The lives of a young couple intertwine with a much older man as he reflects back on a lost love while he's trapped in an automobile crash.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207222/","name":"Scott Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1429380/","name":"Britt Robertson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863387/","name":"George Tillman Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0081189/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0817023/","name":"Nicholas Sparks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093271/","name":"Craig Bolotin"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse "The Monuments Men" with last November's "Last Vegas."'\n\n"The Monuments Men" boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, "The Monuments Men" deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.\n\nGeorge Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until "The Monuments Men." His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with "The Ides of March" and "Good Night, and Good Luck." He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.\n\nThe difficulty of "The Monuments Men" is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for "The Monuments Men." The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.\n\nWith those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of "The Monuments Men." Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in "Blue Jasmine," Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in "The Monuments Men" is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.\n\n"The Monuments Men" wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt.

Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse "The Monuments Men" with last November's "Last Vegas."'\n\n"The Monuments Men" boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, "The Monuments Men" deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.\n\nGeorge Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until "The Monuments Men." His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with "The Ides of March" and "Good Night, and Good Luck." He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.\n\nThe difficulty of "The Monuments Men" is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for "The Monuments Men." The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.\n\nWith those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of "The Monuments Men." Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in "Blue Jasmine," Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in "The Monuments Men" is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.\n\n"The Monuments Men" wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt. Clooney attempts to force sentiment on his audience, but it is unearned and unwanted. "The Monuments Men" was originally set to release last December (a fitting release for pushing films in the Oscar race), but was moved to an alternative February. My guess is the studio realized "The Monuments Men" was nothing more than an award season misfit.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":128083,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2014-02-26","keywords":"art,art expert,nazi stolen art,1940s,world war two","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1176348697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzcyOTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAzMzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzcyOTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAzMzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a race against time, a crew of art historians and museum curators unite to recover renowned works of art stolen by Nazis before Hitler destroys them.

Buckley excels both vocally and portraying the problems of so many in similar positions. It has ups and downs and doesn't shy away from challenging issues nor glorify them. Julie Walters alongside Buckley was perfect also. Although their greatness on set did outshine most of the supporting cast who had a daytime cheap tv drama feel about them although this did not take to much away. Also anything involving whispering Bob Harris has to be worth seeing. A feel good romp of a film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12418,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-04-12","keywords":"singer,country music singer,train,party,release from prison","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2535701529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzMmUxM2MtMWZkYi00ZDk2LWFjN2YtMjI3ZDc1ZTVmMjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzMmUxM2MtMWZkYi00ZDk2LWFjN2YtMjI3ZDc1ZTVmMjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Fresh out of a stint in prison, Rose-Lynn is a single mom with an ankle monitor, a curfew, and a concerned mother (Julie Walters), who wants her to focus more on her two children and less on her music.

There is just every element in it to make it work. There is a pretty girl, beautiful clothes, upbeat music, dancing, parties, and the obligatory gay best friend. The weddings adds to the main leads' romance, rather than distract, which is quite a feat. I enjoyed watching this very much.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2131,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"boyfriend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Wedding Year Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4139237145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYzMzhjNjEtYzlmYy00YjA4LThjYTEtY2MzY2UzYjhhZmY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYzMzhjNjEtYzlmYy00YjA4LThjYTEtY2MzY2UzYjhhZmY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0405103/","name":"Sarah Hyland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1927701/","name":"Tyler James Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1564087/","name":"Jenna Dewan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525659/","name":"Robert Luketic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0569644/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0487157/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5344507/","name":"Donald Diego"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Fellwechselzeit: Directed by Sabrina Mertens. With Zelda Espenschied, Miriam Schiweck, Freya Kreutzkam, Bernd Wolf. The still life of a family in 57 pictures. Germany in the 1970ies. Stephanie is an intelligent and lively child. But she leads an isolated life with her parents, marked by the symbiotic bonding with her mentally unstable mother. A mother who has never really left her own childhood behind and who lives amidst things of the past and the memories connected to them. Stephanie's relationship with her father is one of mistrust. The passing years only bring aging, but no future. Unspoken thoughts lurk underneath the surface of everyday life. So Stephanie retreats into a dark world of barbaric fantasies, that are nourished by the traces of the past and only belong to her alone. One day, however, Stephanie's secret invades the family's reality." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt11758900/","name":"Fellwechselzeit","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFkZGQ2ODctZjViOS00Yjc0LThjZjctZjg1YzliNTRlMDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODU2NjIzMjc@._V1_.jpg","description":"The still life of a family in 57 pictures.

The first half of the movie gives a very intriguing premise with solid performances, as a drama works perfectly, as a comedy fails with very forced and unnefective jokes.

The first half of the movie gives a very intriguing premise with solid performances, as a drama works perfectly, as a comedy fails with very forced and unnefective jokes. The problem of the movie is that once you start solving the puzzle, the story feels very stupid and ridiculous (specially the twist) to force a predictable ending. I give it a 5 because of its very strong acting that made the movie watchable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2614,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-05-16","keywords":"remake,animal in title,weasel,friendship between men,husband wife relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler 2 [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2150939673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzOTdhMDAtZDg2My00MDhjLTk3OTktNzc4ZTIzZWY1NDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzOTdhMDAtZDg2My00MDhjLTk3OTktNzc4ZTIzZWY1NDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0096559/","name":"Graciela Borges","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0553650/","name":"Oscar Martínez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104809/","name":"Luis Brandoni"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002728/","name":"Juan José Campanella"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119804/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037736/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0777272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002728/","name":"Juan José Campanella","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0321368/","name":"Augusto Giustozzi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0459990/","name":"Darren Kloomok"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Confusing psychodrama and reality as if there is no difference says something disturbing about the Japanese sense of self. Any Westerner would find such a practice a disturbing and offensive intrusion into and offensive parody of their personal integrity.\n\nIn the West we can accept role-playing dramas, which often have satisfying or even cathartic effects, because the illusion is a temporary imaginary leap, and the experience an exercise in self-analysis and mindfulness. Lessons are drawn which can be applied back in one's real life, having been a recreation that strengthens our emotional life, just as physical exercise strengthens our body. Well-written dramas can also impart this kind of creative refreshment. But the Japanese acceptance of play-acting as essentially indistinguishable from actuality, and as having the identical moral standing of authentic behaviour, is surely a dangerous category confusion? This seems to be exposed as the film shows the difficulty the man finds in posing convincingly as the father of a young child while at the same time keeping his emotional distance - as it is stipulated he must as a condition of his employment. One thinks in the West of those unpleasant consequences where undercover security operations have led to the betrayal of the emotions and the lives of partners whom agents have fallen in love with, even married and had children by, in the guise of an entirely false persona. Court cases have tended to follow.\n\nOne can speculate that this disturbing insincerity, which can so easily turn into real but still cheating feelings, is only tolerable in a society and culture that within living memory was still highly formalised according to strict traditional imperatives, that dictated not only the physical but also, to an extreme degree, the interior life of the people. This deprived thought and action of any moral component, producing a culture - as is well known - of shame, instead of guilt; of dissimulation, not confession.\n\nA society that recently valued only mere correct appearance remains vulnerable to such imposture, treating what we would deem impostors and deceivers exactly like authentic persons. If the Japanese still lack, to some degree, the moral centre to distinguish between mere artifice and psychological integrity, then their obsession with automata as acceptable simulacra of human beings, even without application of any Turing test to demonstrate actual sentience, is indicative.\n\nI don't say the Japanese have no modern sensibility, of course. After the terrible debacle, in the Second World War, of their unique traditional world-view, they have finally entered the moral universe. However, it seems they do retain a residual psychological tendency that remains susceptible to mere appearances.

It is available on DVD or streaming and should not be missed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-03","keywords":"east germany,painter,doctor,forced abortion,pregnancy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1224587801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Never Look Away' follows thirty years in the life of artist Kurt Barnert (a character loosely based on Gerhard Richter).

Confusing psychodrama and reality as if there is no difference says something disturbing about the Japanese sense of self. Any Westerner would find such a practice a disturbing and offensive intrusion into and offensive parody of their personal integrity.\n\nIn the West we can accept role-playing dramas, which often have satisfying or even cathartic effects, because the illusion is a temporary imaginary leap, and the experience an exercise in self-analysis and mindfulness. Lessons are drawn which can be applied back in one's real life, having been a recreation that strengthens our emotional life, just as physical exercise strengthens our body. Well-written dramas can also impart this kind of creative refreshment. But the Japanese acceptance of play-acting as essentially indistinguishable from actuality, and as having the identical moral standing of authentic behaviour, is surely a dangerous category confusion? This seems to be exposed as the film shows the difficulty the man finds in posing convincingly as the father of a young child while at the same time keeping his emotional distance - as it is stipulated he must as a condition of his employment. One thinks in the West of those unpleasant consequences where undercover security operations have led to the betrayal of the emotions and the lives of partners whom agents have fallen in love with, even married and had children by, in the guise of an entirely false persona. Court cases have tended to follow.\n\nOne can speculate that this disturbing insincerity, which can so easily turn into real but still cheating feelings, is only tolerable in a society and culture that within living memory was still highly formalised according to strict traditional imperatives, that dictated not only the physical but also, to an extreme degree, the interior life of the people. This deprived thought and action of any moral component, producing a culture - as is well known - of shame, instead of guilt; of dissimulation, not confession.\n\nA society that recently valued only mere correct appearance remains vulnerable to such imposture, treating what we would deem impostors and deceivers exactly like authentic persons. If the Japanese still lack, to some degree, the moral centre to distinguish between mere artifice and psychological integrity, then their obsession with automata as acceptable simulacra of human beings, even without application of any Turing test to demonstrate actual sentience, is indicative.\n\nI don't say the Japanese have no modern sensibility, of course. After the terrible debacle, in the Second World War, of their unique traditional world-view, they have finally entered the moral universe. However, it seems they do retain a residual psychological tendency that remains susceptible to mere appearances.

I wanted to take in every second of what the camera was capturing for me, like admiring a great work of art in a museum.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-01-29","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0405418/","name":"Ildikó Hámori","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350587/","name":"Anna Györgyi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0468514/","name":"Zsolt Kovács"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2843398/","name":"Linda Dombrovszky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0747074/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4302531/","name":"György Somogyi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0843651/","name":"Magda Szabó","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2703215/","name":"Sándor Szélesi"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a movie I was happy to take my teen-aged children to see because it also educated and entertained them. I thought the cast did a great job. The script was outstanding and the direction excellent. Tom Cruise gave a dimension to Von Stauffenberg that deepened my understanding of the events. The supporting cast were brilliant. \n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nPS. It's some time since I wrote this review and I took thirty minutes tonight to read the other reviews on this movie, not surprisingly they are mostly very positive and unanimous in praising it. Interestingly, the critics, including the one named above, who trashed the movie without even seeing it, obviously did so in an effort to kill it at the box office. While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'.

Nevertheless - creators of "Blizzard of souls" are touching audiences with the simplicity, with extracted one person perspective, one joy and love, one... This is actually extremely hard to shine light on history trough a personal journey trough war days and relationships that are formed by the rush of war - everyone understands the urgency to take action and live this very second, to fullest, since there's great chance that might be the last sunrise, last meal, last kiss.

This is the movie that starts great line of stories - after the Alexander Green masterpiece here as cinematic marvel, people should watch "Chronicles of Melania" - these both are letting foreign people to understand the utmost importance and pain we feel and can make you understand why all the time under the soviet oppression was so dark for people who just recently had to fight so courageously to have own time, own country and own values..

It's hard to tell a story about a time that has been long gone, yet is in people's memories trough books and history lessons in school. Nevertheless - creators of "Blizzard of souls" are touching audiences with the simplicity, with extracted one person perspective, one joy and love, one... This is actually extremely hard to shine light on history trough a personal journey trough war days and relationships that are formed by the rush of war - everyone understands the urgency to take action and live this very second, to fullest, since there's great chance that might be the last sunrise, last meal, last kiss. Yet everyone is hoping to be able to live long enough to have that peace after.. Movie balances, telling us all the mix of emotions via superb camera work, brilliant movie soundtrack and acting that is heavenly simple and to the point. Some of the episodes are proudly written in the golden heritage of Latvian cinema, some will be. This is the movie that starts great line of stories - after the Alexander Green masterpiece here as cinematic marvel, people should watch "Chronicles of Melania" - these both are letting foreign people to understand the utmost importance and pain we feel and can make you understand why all the time under the soviet oppression was so dark for people who just recently had to fight so courageously to have own time, own country and own values.. No - this is not an easy and entertaining movie. This is a soul shaker. I would love to see 11 stars out of 10 - but giving here full 9 - as my effort towards "less biased" ratings.

When he disappears before a court date and the family's home is at risk if he doesn't show up, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) investigates amongst the locals to find out where he might be.

The sparse, beautiful winter settings are a perfect backdrop for the story. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that does as good a job as this one in communicating a sense of place.\n\nWinter's Bone may not be for everyone, though. There are no shoot-outs or florid romantic scenes. The moments of happiness are small, fleeting, and poignant; like a gift of generosity from a neighbor who knows you're in need, or the quiet assurances of an older sister to her younger siblings.

Rob Hall together with Scott Fischer: Jake Gyllenhaal , teamed up on a joint expedition .

He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.\n\nRhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. \n\nThe theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.\n\nThe future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. \n\nIs it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes. We're talking about a movie that lifts words, then says they came from a thief. A bit of a paradox if anything. Similarly, it would be silly for J.J. Abrams to direct a movie that's filled with scenes from every Steven Spielberg film, yet that happened with Super 8.\n\nIf Anonymous has a fault, it would be in jerking around the audience. The movie starts with an inventive use of a framing device, and quite appropriately in a theatre. We go back and Ben Johnson is jailed, only for us to go back 5 years to see him getting jailed. Then we go back another 40 and when we next see Johnson he's being set free. So  in which time is he released? Thankfully Anonymous is long enough to allow an audience to gain bearings.\n\nAnonymous is Emmerich's masterpiece, a radical far from his usual environmental apocalypse works. There could be a stigma surrounding the subject, which will be viewed as blasphemy by many. I'd like to reassure you that most popular cinema is an act of fiction. Shakespeare isn't available to rebut, and most moviegoers are not concerned with historical accuracy so long as the story is compelling and filled with drama, which Anonymous delivers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-28","keywords":"conspiracy theory,william shakespeare character,elizabeth i character,historical fiction,earl of oxford","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10 Reasons Why Shakespeare Is a Fraud","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1157013017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Director Roland Emmerich gives 10 reasons why he believes Shakespeare was a fraud."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000603/","name":"Vanessa Redgrave"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000667/","name":"David Thewlis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650089/","name":"John Orloff"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No more fabulous Technicolor experiments in color, no pulsating score in the vein of Goblin, but instead a stupid decision to retain Argento and Daria Nicolodi's 3 Mothers supernatural story, the weakest element of the show.\n\nI was a huge fan of Argento's "animal" titled thrillers Bird, Cat and Flies, and even owned a 16mm 'Scope print of Four Flies on Grey Velvet back in my movie buff days of the '70s. But I never got into his later supernatural horror shows, while admiring Suspiria for its technical brilliance.\n\nNow remakes are problematic in the first place, and just copying or aping an original like Gus Van Sant did with "Psycho" is an exercise in futility. But I did enjoy both the original "The Initiation of Sarah" and its fine TV remake. These are traditional horror films in the same genre as "Suspiria", set in a female world.\n\nA pornographer would have taken this remake opportunity (called porn-parody in the Adult biz) and used it perhaps for a Sweetheart Video of lesbian porn, with the top young and old actresses having romantic liaisons. "Confessions of a Sinful Nun" is a recent example from Sweetheart of this approach in a non-supernatural nunsploitation vein.\n\nBut Luca opted instead for the sadistic brand of horror porn, meat hooks and all, with plenty of gore and unpleasantness rather than erotic entertainment. His use of urination is yet another example of rejecting sex in favor of other staples of pornography (softcore division). And his casting of several of Europe's best actresses of recent decades goes for naught: Tilda Swinton quite professional in a lousy, paper-thin role; Angela Winkler solid but hardly up to her great work for German directors; Sophie Testud lost in the shuffle along with the fabulous Renee Soutendijk, and only Ingrid Caven allowed one scene of panache near the end. Bringing back Jessica Harper was a good idea, and her scene has some power.\n\nThe many dimly-lit scenes play poorly on the home screen, evidently "artistic" for theatrical runs, of which the movie was one big flop at the boxoffice.

No more fabulous Technicolor experiments in color, no pulsating score in the vein of Goblin, but instead a stupid decision to retain Argento and Daria Nicolodi's 3 Mothers supernatural story, the weakest element of the show.\n\nI was a huge fan of Argento's "animal" titled thrillers Bird, Cat and Flies, and even owned a 16mm 'Scope print of Four Flies on Grey Velvet back in my movie buff days of the '70s. But I never got into his later supernatural horror shows, while admiring Suspiria for its technical brilliance.\n\nNow remakes are problematic in the first place, and just copying or aping an original like Gus Van Sant did with "Psycho" is an exercise in futility. But I did enjoy both the original "The Initiation of Sarah" and its fine TV remake. These are traditional horror films in the same genre as "Suspiria", set in a female world.\n\nA pornographer would have taken this remake opportunity (called porn-parody in the Adult biz) and used it perhaps for a Sweetheart Video of lesbian porn, with the top young and old actresses having romantic liaisons. "Confessions of a Sinful Nun" is a recent example from Sweetheart of this approach in a non-supernatural nunsploitation vein.\n\nBut Luca opted instead for the sadistic brand of horror porn, meat hooks and all, with plenty of gore and unpleasantness rather than erotic entertainment. His use of urination is yet another example of rejecting sex in favor of other staples of pornography (softcore division). And his casting of several of Europe's best actresses of recent decades goes for naught: Tilda Swinton quite professional in a lousy, paper-thin role; Angela Winkler solid but hardly up to her great work for German directors; Sophie Testud lost in the shuffle along with the fabulous Renee Soutendijk, and only Ingrid Caven allowed one scene of panache near the end. Bringing back Jessica Harper was a good idea, and her scene has some power.\n\nThe many dimly-lit scenes play poorly on the home screen, evidently "artistic" for theatrical runs, of which the movie was one big flop at the boxoffice. The prologue staring Chloe Grace Moretz is terrible: poorly edited, uninvolving and utterly failing to engage the viewer in the story, just a waste of time and footage.\n\nJust when I had gained an interest in a relatively new director thanks to his sensitive gay-themed "Call Me" movie, the guy's feet of clay were revealed here -just another delusional hack.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68109,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-11-02","keywords":"1970s,witches' coven,telepathy,good versus evil,mysterious disappearance","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1749334809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJjNGJkYWEtNjFmOS00M2I5LTg4MjgtZjYzOTdhMGNiMjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJjNGJkYWEtNjFmOS00M2I5LTg4MjgtZjYzOTdhMGNiMjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the artistic director, an ambitious young dancer, and a grieving psychotherapist.

He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.\n\nRhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. \n\nThe theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.\n\nThe future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. \n\nIs it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes. We're talking about a movie that lifts words, then says they came from a thief. A bit of a paradox if anything. Similarly, it would be silly for J.J. Abrams to direct a movie that's filled with scenes from every Steven Spielberg film, yet that happened with Super 8.\n\nIf Anonymous has a fault, it would be in jerking around the audience. The movie starts with an inventive use of a framing device, and quite appropriately in a theatre. We go back and Ben Johnson is jailed, only for us to go back 5 years to see him getting jailed. Then we go back another 40 and when we next see Johnson he's being set free. So  in which time is he released? Thankfully Anonymous is long enough to allow an audience to gain bearings.\n\nAnonymous is Emmerich's masterpiece, a radical far from his usual environmental apocalypse works. There could be a stigma surrounding the subject, which will be viewed as blasphemy by many. I'd like to reassure you that most popular cinema is an act of fiction. Shakespeare isn't available to rebut, and most moviegoers are not concerned with historical accuracy so long as the story is compelling and filled with drama, which Anonymous delivers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-28","keywords":"conspiracy theory,william shakespeare character,elizabeth i character,historical fiction,earl of oxford","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10 Reasons Why Shakespeare Is a Fraud","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1157013017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Director Roland Emmerich gives 10 reasons why he believes Shakespeare was a fraud."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000603/","name":"Vanessa Redgrave"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000667/","name":"David Thewlis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650089/","name":"John Orloff"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It sounds weird, but for some reason, it shaped the sense of humor of a generation and possibly one of the inspirations that helped exceed the imagination and creativity of many cartoon shows that came after. The show itself has been terrific in its first three seasons, but after its first feature film, it slowly loses its touch until every character becomes something else other than what they were once known for. This latest Spongebob film might be the end of its glory as it seemingly panders the audience into another lame Alvin and the Chipmunks/The Smurfs approach, but surprisingly that only becomes a marketing stunt, and it turns out that most of the movie is basically just like the show, but at its original form. It didn't need any grand or blockbuster type of plot to save the material, we just need to revisit the stuff that we truly loved about Spongebob.\n\nOther than its creative animation and zany undersea world, Spongebob Squarepants has always been known for its richly established characters and unique sense of humor. I haven't seen the show in a while, specifically the newer episodes, but I do remember how the ones that followed season four have become paler incarnations of the show. This feature film, while stuck in posing as a typical family movie fare, is actually meant to stay loyal to what really defines this show. The characters have gone back to their classic personalities (Spongebob can now be reasonable again than just a complete goofball) and the humor is smartly priceless in an ultimately unhinged way. The film doesn't offer anymore bigger plot than retrieving the Krabby Patty secret formula, it's all about fooling at the audiences as it messes with the logic and their senses, the Spongebob way, of course.\n\nThe mix of animation and live-action is definitely never a stranger to Spongebob, but its involvement is often taken as a joke. Here, it's supposed to be its central idea. Though, it takes so long for them to get out of the water, in spite of its title, but when they do, it still sticks to its own surreal, extremely ludicrous style. But their welcoming antics up there felt forced, in comparison. The 3D stuff really exists to attract the viewers who thinks it's gonna be a cute adventure with the characters as silly superheroes, but it's mostly just a small payoff to those who have that expectation. It kind of cheats them, otherwise it's a cool trick for instead luring them to what makes this material so enjoyable. But we don't have to underestimate this approach too much, because apparently it's still pretty fun when they are in the real world, giving the humans some hilarious reactions, like the one who's wondering if the Krabby Patty he's eating is hallucinogenic after encountering the gang as superheroes.\n\nAs feature film goes, it doesn't go beyond bombastic, if it does then it's all about the weirdness instead of epic proportions. This is basically just like a new episode on a length of an actual movie. And the cast has always been great no matter what. Out of all the cartoons Tom Kenny has been, Spongebob will always be his best and he once again brings the lovable charm to the character. While Antonio Banderas makes a fun turn as the villain, but his moments are the one where he interacts to talking seagulls which amazingly works for this character.\n\nThe Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is what the fans deserve. Not sure how the newcomers would exactly react to it, but this movie fully represents the true spirit of the show. It would be a brilliant surprise to the ones who missed this great side of Spongebob. It didn't need any deeper sentiments or darkness (unless we're referring to its twisted humor, because it gets a little close to that.) Sure it's not the best episode ever either, but it has so many elements that remind us why we loved this show in the first place. The out-of-water scenes weren't as bad as many fans were worried about, it's just some randomly crazy addition to an already fun ride. Overall, it's more nostalgic than groundbreaking, I do hope this movie would be the salvation of this show. It won't change anyone's life or anything, we just like Spongebob to be Spongebob again and that's already given too much to a fan like me who grew up with the cartoon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"dinosaur,formula,plankton,secret formula,bubble","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi421768985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After spending his entire life under the sea in the Bikini Bottom Gulch, Spongebob, Patrick and the rest of their friends go on a quest to find the stolen recipe for their Krabby Patty burgers, which brings them into our world, where they encounter a nefarious pirate named Burger-Beard.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444786/","name":"Tom Kenny"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265067/","name":"Bill Fagerbakke"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196684/","name":"Paul Tibbitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020957/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008743/","name":"Jonathan Aibel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074184/","name":"Glenn Berger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384864/","name":"Stephen Hillenburg"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored, visually and audibly.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not bad!","reviewBody":"It's not the greatest medical drama and does not compare to ER as far as realism goes but as a nurse most of the medical stuff is correct and every show gets stuff wrong so don't not like a medical show because it's not 100% accurate. \n\nI like that they have taken this show on from a different angle - money and corruption! I don't live in the USA but I imagine this is actually quite accurate in the way hospitals are run and that it is all about money and not necessarily doing what's best for the patient. \n\nThe characters so far are interesting - I'm 7 episodes in and I like that some patients are in it for longer than an episode.

The actors were bland, no emotion whatsoever... the movie dragged throughout the whole ordeal, the acting was a bit forced, sometimes... The only good things on this piece of cr*p was the effects on the first kill and the beautiful dog (I love dogs) and the lead acctress, that had a very nice face, not looking "fake" like many others... the movie itself, was boring, dull, and a real letdown...

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

He's more bad-ass in this than Bond ever was!\n\nA word to the wise, though, this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish. It is a comedy but a very, very violent kind of comedy. And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into serious films or family friendly comedies.

I am male, mid sixties, and have watched, like many others, all the great (and not-so-great) horror films. After watching the ten episodes of 'The Handmaid's Tale' I can safely say that THIS is a real horror story. It makes the entire horror genre seem like cotton candy. After each episode I find myself shaking, often with tears in my eyes. I'm not going to talk about the story. I am going to tell you that the acting is beyond reproach. In almost every movie, every TV series, there are at least one or two characters that don't fit or are poorly portrayed. Not so here. I simply cannot find fault with the performances of the entire cast. Stellar! The sets, the direction, the camera work, the intensity all fit together seamlessly. This is a story of a good world...gone very wrong. This is a story about faith, twisted by evil intent, then thrust upon the common people. For me it is truly horrifying.

The adult-targeted humour is kept to a minimum and the physical comedy is amped up to levels that is normally irritating but here works an absolute treat. Its success can be attributed, in a big way, to the lovable alien Oh (Jim Parsons). A clumsy go-getter with endearing optimism, cuddly colour-changing looks, and amusing speech patterns, Oh steals the spotlight whenever he is on screen, which is about 95% of the time. As his plucky partner in adventure, Tip, Rihanna's precocious human child is fairly stock standard, whilst Steve Martin's dim-witted leader of Oh's Boov race lands a few hilarious moments among some dull ones.

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":426944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Funny but predictable - still entertaining if you let it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1630,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"disability,wilhelm scream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Die Goldfische","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3829447705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiZjViMDctZWE0Mi00NDdlLThjYzQtN2Q3YWQ0NjEyMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiZjViMDctZWE0Mi00NDdlLThjYzQtN2Q3YWQ0NjEyMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771713/","name":"Tom Schilling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1678891/","name":"Klaas Heufer-Umlauf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3474804/","name":"Lisa Bitter"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2285783/","name":"Alireza Golafshan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008261/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2285783/","name":"Alireza Golafshan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1487045/","name":"Justyna Müsch"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He does well - so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler. But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl; the mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agent Colin Bates. And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8423767/","name":"Patrick L.

Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel. He does well - so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler. But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl; the mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agent Colin Bates. And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8423767/","name":"Patrick L.

The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.\n\nGone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little "fun" in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.\n\nThis (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.\n\nHarry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.\n\nShe wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that "stab you in the back" thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.\n\nIt is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.\n\nThe characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.\n\nKreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.\n\nAll in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.\n\nNow I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":534103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-08-15","keywords":"friendship,argus filch character,abusive uncle,bullying,albus dumbledore character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192310553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.\n\nGone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little "fun" in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.\n\nThis (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.\n\nHarry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.\n\nShe wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that "stab you in the back" thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.\n\nIt is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.\n\nThe characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.\n\nKreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.\n\nAll in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.\n\nNow I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":534103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-08-15","keywords":"friendship,argus filch character,abusive uncle,bullying,albus dumbledore character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192310553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

In a mystery that carries him from gin-soaked jazz clubs in Harlem to the hard-edged slums of Brooklyn and, finally, into the gilded halls of New York's power brokers, Lionel contends with thugs, corruption and the most dangerous man in the city to honor his friend and save the woman who might be his own salvation.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1813221/","name":"Gugu Mbatha-Raw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113781/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113140/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504672/","name":"Jonathan Lethem"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).\n\nNow the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&amp;Ms.\n\nEmma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face ("now act SURPRISED" - "now show us a sense of WONDER" - "now look SAD"). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they spend the 200 million budget on?\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity for Disney.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Fantasy","Musical"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&amp;Ms.\n\nEmma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face ("now act SURPRISED" - "now show us a sense of WONDER" - "now look SAD"). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they spend the 200 million budget on?\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity for Disney.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Fantasy","Musical"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down.

On the surface, it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film, casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take, opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichés, including rooftop billowing fog, high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness, and larger than life acrobatic feats ("always check the garbage days" moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall). Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons (including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages) could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted, enjoyable cinematic fun. \n\nBut Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody, which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer, Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing, settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crime/mystery thriller and poignant character study, as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability, and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground, Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity, utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. \n\nOf course, being the work of a first time director, one would expect the occasional fumble, and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax, meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless, an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism (clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources) which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional, adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley, managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift, whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest, either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. \n\nThe casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius, as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film, beautifully blending child-like emotional simplicity, tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true, as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor, warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker, yet just as resonant.

On the surface, it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film, casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take, opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichés, including rooftop billowing fog, high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness, and larger than life acrobatic feats ("always check the garbage days" moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall). Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons (including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages) could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted, enjoyable cinematic fun. \n\nBut Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody, which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer, Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing, settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crime/mystery thriller and poignant character study, as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability, and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground, Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity, utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. \n\nOf course, being the work of a first time director, one would expect the occasional fumble, and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax, meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless, an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism (clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources) which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional, adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley, managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift, whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest, either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. \n\nThe casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius, as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film, beautifully blending child-like emotional simplicity, tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true, as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor, warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker, yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichés with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop, and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally, Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner, infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour, and bringing welcome life to the film.\n\nIt would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist: slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times, yet cleverly self-aware, comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness, and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic, cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody, straight out superhero film or character study (or ultimately all three), Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success, and one easily worth a watch.\n\n-7.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-13","keywords":"vigilante,superhero,gun running,organized crime,pimp","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Defendor: U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi554959897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around three characters: an everyday guy who comes to believe he's a superhero, his psychiatrist, and the teenager he befriends.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993507/","name":"Kat Dennings","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0644897/","name":"Sandra Oh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255931/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005584/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great.

The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.)

But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down. This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest. \n\nI am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epic nature of the true story. \n\nThe characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together.\n\nMy rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling. If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Their purpose and meaning to the unfolding mystery is becoming evident and damn fascinating. All thanks to the performers who have already got this perfectly down-pat in the first episode, and that allows the story to take shape and meaning for the remainder of the series.\n\nSo far this series is more than about fighting mums and a "who-done-it". What is so prevalent in the first episode is the underlying themes of parenthood, marital relationships and school-mom politics. I'm sure the writers will have more juice to add as the series progresses.\n\nFor now, it's the mystery that has got me hooked. And to heighten my viewing pleasure, it is the development of the characters and the conflicts surrounding them, and also within, that makes me want to watch it that little bit longer, hopefully right to the very end of the series that is slowly peeling away the hypocrisy and the nastiness of an affluent suburb/town!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":172437,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-02-19","keywords":"domestic violence,mother daughter relationship,abuse,murder,husband wife relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0940362/","name":"Shailene Woodley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050201/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0373561/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005082/","name":"David E.

On the surface, it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film, casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take, opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichés, including rooftop billowing fog, high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness, and larger than life acrobatic feats ("always check the garbage days" moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall). Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons (including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages) could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted, enjoyable cinematic fun. \n\nBut Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody, which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer, Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing, settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crime/mystery thriller and poignant character study, as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability, and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground, Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity, utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. \n\nOf course, being the work of a first time director, one would expect the occasional fumble, and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax, meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless, an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism (clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources) which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional, adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley, managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift, whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest, either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. \n\nThe casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius, as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film, beautifully blending child-like emotional simplicity, tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true, as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor, warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker, yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichés with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop, and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally, Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner, infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour, and bringing welcome life to the film.\n\nIt would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist: slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times, yet cleverly self-aware, comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness, and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic, cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody, straight out superhero film or character study (or ultimately all three), Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success, and one easily worth a watch.\n\n-7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-13","keywords":"vigilante,superhero,gun running,organized crime,pimp","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Defendor: U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi554959897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around three characters: an everyday guy who comes to believe he's a superhero, his psychiatrist, and the teenager he befriends."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993507/","name":"Kat Dennings"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0644897/","name":"Sandra Oh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005584/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer, Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing, settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crime/mystery thriller and poignant character study, as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability, and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground, Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity, utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. \n\nOf course, being the work of a first time director, one would expect the occasional fumble, and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax, meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless, an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism (clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources) which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional, adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley, managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift, whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest, either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. \n\nThe casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius, as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film, beautifully blending child-like emotional simplicity, tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true, as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor, warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker, yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichés with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop, and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally, Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner, infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour, and bringing welcome life to the film.\n\nIt would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist: slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times, yet cleverly self-aware, comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness, and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic, cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody, straight out superhero film or character study (or ultimately all three), Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success, and one easily worth a watch.\n\n-7.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-13","keywords":"vigilante,superhero,gun running,organized crime,pimp","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Defendor: U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi554959897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around three characters: an everyday guy who comes to believe he's a superhero, his psychiatrist, and the teenager he befriends.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993507/","name":"Kat Dennings","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0644897/","name":"Sandra Oh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255931/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005584/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It carried a genuine tongue-in-cheek mockery of the entire industry and blew up 'their' ridiculousness to the max. \n\nLets begin with the positive: Kristen Wiig as Alexanya Atoz is pure performance art. The styling and make-up is so on point. But even more impressive is her wicked accent. It was, hands down, the funniest aspect of the film. Every time she opened her mouth I died. Could not contain the laughter. Her dedication to that character's weird speech pattern was super impressive. The cameo performances were a delight in the original and that has managed to follow through effortlessly. More cameo's that are more irreverent and more outrageous than before. The cameos at the end are truly worth while. The few in the beginning are forgettable. The actors conviction. I cannot fault any of the actors for not putting in their best, assuming the material to work with was fairly weak to begin with, I found the actors conviction to the characters totally playful. \n\nSo what went wrong with this second installation? Quite honestly, it was the shift away from a parody of the fashion industry, moving towards a Wayans' brothers spoof of a spy film with a dash of espionage. And like any Wayans brother movie one can expect cheap visual gags to fill up free space - there's some really great lines in the film though (really great). Who thought that Zoolander 2 should shoot for the stars at 1h45m? The original barely hit 1h30m, that film had all that set-up and introduction to the world of Zoolander. Part Deux could have dived right in but instead played splish-splash with some really juvenile humour. \n\nYes, Zoolander is an idiot. He's an annoying character. A total self involved tool. But they save him from being despised by allowing the audience to laugh at him. Allowing us to point our fingers at his ridiculous face and laugh till the tears run. But that playground fun time is now over, forced to laugh with him. There's very few sidebar comments that grab our attention and remind us, 'Oh, Zoolander is a douche', not just an idiot.\n\nOther than that Zoolander 2 is a totally run-of-the-mill comedy, nothing too special or outrages, nothing too memorable our outstanding. Fun but not overwhelmingly so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-02-24","keywords":"absurdism,overweight child,model,modeling,fashion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1139323417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDU2MTkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyMTgzNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDU2MTkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyMTgzNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Derek and Hansel team up with an Interpol agent to find out who is behind the deaths of the world's biggest pop stars."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094563/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039303/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857620/","name":"Justin Theroux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831557/","name":"Nicholas Stoller"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Rated R\n\nBlack Rain stars Michael Douglas(Wall Street, Falling Down) and Andy Garcia(The Untouchables, Desperate Measures) as Detectives Nick Conklin and Charlie Vincent.  One day while eating lunch at a local diner, they witness a horrific mob killing.  The twist is that the killer is a dangerous gangster named Sato(Yusaku Matsuda) from Japan who is also wanted their for various other crimes.  Soon after, a chase ensues and Sato is captured.  The police tell Nick and Charlie that he must be returned to Japan in order to be prosecuted.  When they finally get to Japan, the police there are very generous in accepting Sato, only they're not the police, they're Sato's thugs in disguise.  So Nick and Charlie must go after him, but because they are foreigners, no one will help them in their investigation and they must also accept a new partner (Ken Takakura).\n\nFilmed on location in Tokyo, Japan, Ridley Scott, who also directed Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982) and Gladiator(2000) sets up a really dark tone for, much as he does in most of his films.\n\nIt's also surprising how low the rating is for this movie.

Rated R\n\nBlack Rain stars Michael Douglas(Wall Street, Falling Down) and Andy Garcia(The Untouchables, Desperate Measures) as Detectives Nick Conklin and Charlie Vincent.  One day while eating lunch at a local diner, they witness a horrific mob killing.  The twist is that the killer is a dangerous gangster named Sato(Yusaku Matsuda) from Japan who is also wanted their for various other crimes.  Soon after, a chase ensues and Sato is captured.  The police tell Nick and Charlie that he must be returned to Japan in order to be prosecuted.  When they finally get to Japan, the police there are very generous in accepting Sato, only they're not the police, they're Sato's thugs in disguise.  So Nick and Charlie must go after him, but because they are foreigners, no one will help them in their investigation and they must also accept a new partner (Ken Takakura).\n\nFilmed on location in Tokyo, Japan, Ridley Scott, who also directed Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982) and Gladiator(2000) sets up a really dark tone for, much as he does in most of his films.\n\nIt's also surprising how low the rating is for this movie.  It's a classic like so many other of Scott's films.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51899,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-09-22","keywords":"japan,yakuza,police chase,osaka japan,counterfeit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847264/","name":"Ken Takakura"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035763/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015234/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093271/","name":"Craig Bolotin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507863/","name":"Warren Lewis"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"The Naked Gun" is without a doubt the best skewering of all cop movie cliches available in this day and age.  It works on every conceivable level and a few that haven't been conceived yet.\n\nBut what puts it over the top is Leslie Nielsen.\n\nIt's amazing: he was great in "Airplane!", another classic from the ZAZ team (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), and in the lamentably short TV series "Police Squad!".  But here, he spreads his wings and flies to new heights of insanity and delerium.  With jaw set square and tongue firmly in cheek, Neilsen makes the role of Lt. Frank Drebin all his own and the movie-going public's collective life is all the more enriched because of it.\n\nHe's aided and abetted by greats like Kennedy, Presley and Montalban (who knew?) and the movie even finds good moments for John Houseman and Reggie Jackson.  \n\nAs I said, the movie takes off and finds great things to do with police cars with a mind all their own and goes on from there to take on such cliches as car chases, illegal searches, the cleaning out of the desk, the trip to the police lab, shoot-outs, the lax housework of a single police detective, etc., etc., etc.....\n\nAnd what other cop movie in the history of the world has a music video in the middle, courtesy of Herman's Hermits?\n\nJust one.\n\nTen stars and a Dugout Dog for "The Naked Gun", the film that answers once and for all - can Leslie Nielsen do comedy?\n\nI think you know the answer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":160159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1988-12-02","keywords":"police detective,spoof,slapstick comedy,parody,assassin","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Naked Gun","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3084976409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNDZhYTAtM2EzNy00OGVlLTgxM2YtOWRhMmY5OTA4MGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNDZhYTAtM2EzNy00OGVlLTgxM2YtOWRhMmY5OTA4MGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000558/","name":"Leslie Nielsen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001636/","name":"Priscilla Presley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001740/","name":"O.J.

"The Naked Gun" is without a doubt the best skewering of all cop movie cliches available in this day and age.  It works on every conceivable level and a few that haven't been conceived yet.\n\nBut what puts it over the top is Leslie Nielsen.\n\nIt's amazing: he was great in "Airplane!", another classic from the ZAZ team (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), and in the lamentably short TV series "Police Squad!".  But here, he spreads his wings and flies to new heights of insanity and delerium.  With jaw set square and tongue firmly in cheek, Neilsen makes the role of Lt. Frank Drebin all his own and the movie-going public's collective life is all the more enriched because of it.\n\nHe's aided and abetted by greats like Kennedy, Presley and Montalban (who knew?) and the movie even finds good moments for John Houseman and Reggie Jackson.  \n\nAs I said, the movie takes off and finds great things to do with police cars with a mind all their own and goes on from there to take on such cliches as car chases, illegal searches, the cleaning out of the desk, the trip to the police lab, shoot-outs, the lax housework of a single police detective, etc., etc., etc.....\n\nAnd what other cop movie in the history of the world has a music video in the middle, courtesy of Herman's Hermits?\n\nJust one.\n\nTen stars and a Dugout Dog for "The Naked Gun", the film that answers once and for all - can Leslie Nielsen do comedy?\n\nI think you know the answer.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":160159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1988-12-02","keywords":"police detective,spoof,slapstick comedy,parody,assassin","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Naked Gun","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3084976409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNDZhYTAtM2EzNy00OGVlLTgxM2YtOWRhMmY5OTA4MGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNDZhYTAtM2EzNy00OGVlLTgxM2YtOWRhMmY5OTA4MGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000558/","name":"Leslie Nielsen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001636/","name":"Priscilla Presley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001740/","name":"O.J.

Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like "the only law is gravity" and "everyone dies, it's just a matter of how", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60493,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-12-04","keywords":"criminal,bikini,time bomb,aerial camera shot,movie flop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2854073113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzgxODMwODg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NTI4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzgxODMwODg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NTI4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young FBI agent infiltrates an extraordinary team of extreme sports athletes he suspects of masterminding a string of unprecedented, sophisticated corporate heists.

Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like "the only law is gravity" and "everyone dies, it's just a matter of how", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60493,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-12-04","keywords":"criminal,bikini,time bomb,aerial camera shot,movie flop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2854073113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzgxODMwODg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NTI4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzgxODMwODg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NTI4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young FBI agent infiltrates an extraordinary team of extreme sports athletes he suspects of masterminding a string of unprecedented, sophisticated corporate heists.

The show also seems bent on portraying the kids as mentally challenged too. Sure one of them has some tech savvy but, seriously... some of the 'mistakes' they made are 3rd grader nonsense, not high school. \n\nNot believable at all. And I'm pretty forgiving of most marvel titles. I've liked a lot of them just fine. This one is just... awful.\n\nNot sure how the critics are rating this so high.

It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it. But of course it came too late and now the show has been cancelled after it just started to find its footing.\n\nContrary to some other comments I've seen, Enterprise did NOT use its cast to its fullest potential. Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something. Reed was just starting to get some good stuff this season. Enterprise had a wonderful opportunity to connect every Trek series together and revitalize the franchise but all it did (and most people believe this) was bury it. Despite Enterprise's accomplishments, its failures reign supreme. As much as I love Trek, it needs a rest. Maybe after a few years it will be brought back by people who have new ideas to bring to it. Then, hopefully, we will truly go where no one has gone before."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"earth starship,earthling,terran,space explorer,earthman","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000836/","name":"Scott Bakula"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082517/","name":"John Billingsley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086883/","name":"Jolene Blalock"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094909/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053559/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103804/","name":"Brannon Braga"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Blu-Ray Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2275393049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you're looking for action, save this for later. If you want to see a realistic take on space exploration and its mental implications, it's time to watch this.\n\nRealism is the keyword for this film. It doesn't try to convince the viewers with effects or stunts but rather in the way that you could for a brief while really feel you're in space. The director, Eric Hayden's father has been working on the Galileo probe that went to Jupiter which probably had its contribution to this film's script. The whole design of the ship and the mission is very realistic and it'd be quite close to the actual way we would go to Europa if we ever would.\n\nWithout going into spoilers, there is another level going on in the film. More human. Again the characters are realistic and they act like a well trained astronauts would. But as the events unfold, the mental evolution of the main character becomes analogous with the craft's journey both in space and fate.\n\nThere's a hint of third level on the movie which probably means I have to watch this movie again. It's not just the craft or the man inside who's making the journey but us, as human beings collectively.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-06-16","keywords":"accident,low budget sci fi movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Push","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735054105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A science fiction art film about an adventurous mission to Jupiter's moon that is cut short when disaster strikes, killing the co-pilot.

If you're looking for action, save this for later. If you want to see a realistic take on space exploration and its mental implications, it's time to watch this.\n\nRealism is the keyword for this film. It doesn't try to convince the viewers with effects or stunts but rather in the way that you could for a brief while really feel you're in space. The director, Eric Hayden's father has been working on the Galileo probe that went to Jupiter which probably had its contribution to this film's script. The whole design of the ship and the mission is very realistic and it'd be quite close to the actual way we would go to Europa if we ever would.\n\nWithout going into spoilers, there is another level going on in the film. More human. Again the characters are realistic and they act like a well trained astronauts would. But as the events unfold, the mental evolution of the main character becomes analogous with the craft's journey both in space and fate.\n\nThere's a hint of third level on the movie which probably means I have to watch this movie again. It's not just the craft or the man inside who's making the journey but us, as human beings collectively.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-06-16","keywords":"accident,low budget sci fi movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Push","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735054105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A science fiction art film about an adventurous mission to Jupiter's moon that is cut short when disaster strikes, killing the co-pilot.

It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it. But of course it came too late and now the show has been cancelled after it just started to find its footing.\n\nContrary to some other comments I've seen, Enterprise did NOT use its cast to its fullest potential. Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something. Reed was just starting to get some good stuff this season. Enterprise had a wonderful opportunity to connect every Trek series together and revitalize the franchise but all it did (and most people believe this) was bury it. Despite Enterprise's accomplishments, its failures reign supreme. As much as I love Trek, it needs a rest. Maybe after a few years it will be brought back by people who have new ideas to bring to it.

He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.\n\nHellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.\n\nThe plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.\n\nI didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.\n\nI didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
