The movie was written and directed by Olivier Assayas.\n\nGuillaume Canet as publisher Alain Danielson, who is married to the TV actress Slena (Juliette Binoche). They are friends with another couple, author Léonard Spiegel (Vincent Macaigne) and political consultant Valerie, portrayed Nora Hamzawi. Into the mix comes Laure d'Angerville played by Christa Théret. She works for Alain as "Head of Digital Transition."\n\nBecause this is a French film, everyone sleeps with everyone else, and everyone gathers in groups of four, six, or eight to talk, talk, and talk. (They also gather in cafes to talk.)\n\nNothing is going quite right for any of them, and they are all dissatisfied with their lives. This is despite the fact that they are beautiful, successful, relatively wealthy people. (Remember this is a French film.)\n\nOn the positive side is that the acting is excellent, the plot moves forward steadily, if slowly, and the movie embodies everything I know about French intellectuals. OK--it's true that all I know about French intellectuals is what I've seen in movies about French intellectuals.

The movie was written and directed by Olivier Assayas.\n\nGuillaume Canet as publisher Alain Danielson, who is married to the TV actress Slena (Juliette Binoche). They are friends with another couple, author Léonard Spiegel (Vincent Macaigne) and political consultant Valerie, portrayed Nora Hamzawi. Into the mix comes Laure d'Angerville played by Christa Théret. She works for Alain as "Head of Digital Transition."\n\nBecause this is a French film, everyone sleeps with everyone else, and everyone gathers in groups of four, six, or eight to talk, talk, and talk. (They also gather in cafes to talk.)\n\nNothing is going quite right for any of them, and they are all dissatisfied with their lives. This is despite the fact that they are beautiful, successful, relatively wealthy people. (Remember this is a French film.)\n\nOn the positive side is that the acting is excellent, the plot moves forward steadily, if slowly, and the movie embodies everything I know about French intellectuals. OK--it's true that all I know about French intellectuals is what I've seen in movies about French intellectuals. Even so, by that criterion it looks right.\n\nIf you like dialog films, with great French actors, this film is for you. If you like movies with more action and less talk, then Non-Fiction isn't for you.\n\nWe saw on the large screen at Rochester's great Little Theatre. It will work well enough on the small screen.\n\nI think it's worth seeing, but I'm somewhat prejudiced, because I have wanted to see La Binoche act ever since "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" in 1988.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-01-16","keywords":"gay,female nudity,male frontal nudity,male nudity,male rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1581693465","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmNjg4YmUtN2JmZS00MWViLTk0ZmMtNDBlMDc2ODlhNDk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmNjg4YmUtN2JmZS00MWViLTk0ZmMtNDBlMDc2ODlhNDk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in the Parisian publishing world, an editor and an author find themselves in over their heads, as they cope with a middle-age crisis, the changing industry and their wives.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531195/","name":"Vincent Macaigne"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000801/","name":"Olivier Assayas"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0423337/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0351089/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000801/","name":"Olivier Assayas"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unfortunately, one would have to eliminate pretty much the entire main storyline and all the major characters in order to find it.  \n\nThis tale of `three people caught in a web of their own making' is so thoroughly inept, overwrought and inconsequential that it seems more like a parody of film noir than a serious entry in the genre.   The crime that these three people perpetrated in their youth  the one that keeps coming back to haunt them in their approaching middle-age - seems a piddling one at best for a film of this type.  An even more serious problem is that the three lead performers seem stuck in roles that have come to define their métier as actors.  Nick Nolte, for instance, plays his customary down-and-out, barely-teetering-on-the-edge-of-sanity middle aged loser whose capricious nature makes him forever a threat to the security of the group, while Jeff Bridges portrays the common sense, constantly put-upon ringleader who just wants to forget all about the past but who has a hard time keeping a leash on the unpredictable Nolte.   Sharon Stone completes the trio as Bridges' now moody, alcoholic wife  a pale imitation of her much more meaty role in Martin Scorcease's `Casino.'  Stone's over-the-top thespian simpering reduces the (fortunately) few scenes she is in to the level of unintentional high comedy.  Moreover, in their attempt to provide a dual level structure to their tale  crosscutting scenes of the past with scenes of the present  the filmmakers have been forced to employ actors who look nothing like their contemporary counterparts.  The result is, initially, confusing and, ultimately, quite ludicrous.\n\nWhat is most strange about `Simpatico' is that, while the story itself fizzles and the audience could care less what happens to these three whining, puling, muking central characters, writer/director Matthew Warchus and co-author David Nicholls somehow manage to create a back story and two minor characters who engage both our sympathy and our interest.  These come in the form of the always splendid Albert Finney as the man our intrepid band of halfwit con men managed to entrap into an extortion scheme twenty years earlier, and the charming Catherine Keener as the highly principled grocery store cashier who finds herself unwittingly a pawn in Bridges' plot to rein Nolte in.  Finney and Keener provide so much warmth and humanity in their few scenes together that we find ourselves regretting that the film does not revolve around them entirely.  Wisely, after we wheeze our way through all the hullabaloo and nonsense necessary to bring the main plot to its ludicrous conclusion, Warchus closes the film with a coda focused on these two winning characters.  The finale, in some inexplicable way, seems more like a beginning than an ending and we find ourselves wanting to see what happens to this offbeat, likeable couple.  By wasting our time concentrating on the Nolte/Bridges/Stone triumvirate of insipidity, the filmmakers end up making us feel even more resentful in the long run.

Nonetheless enjoyable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91619,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance","Sport"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"legs,cheerleading squad,bikini,teenage romance,female nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244630/","name":"Eliza Dushku","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103038/","name":"Jesse Bradford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0715636/","name":"Peyton Reed"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335449/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070566/","name":"Jessica Bendinger"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I've seen the film three times and the first two times was terrifying to me in parts. The last viewing wasn't as scary, but maybe I was distracted by seeing this on DVD for the first time, which enhanced the visuals and added some nice 5.1surround sound.\n\nAt two hours and 10 minutes, it's a bit long but there are very few lulls, if any. Gary Oldham gives his normal intense performance as Dracula and it never hurts to have Anthony Hopkins in the film. \n\nThe only negative I found was Keannu Reeves, who sounds a bit wooden in his lines. Is it my imagination, or is he a terrible actor? Maybe it's just his voice. Nonetheless, Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Sadie Frost and Bill Campbell all give good support to this film which is a real feast for the senses.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":202890,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"1992-11-13","keywords":"dracula,vampire,horror movie remake,monster sex,female vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bram Stoker's Dracula","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3978142745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGUxZTM4NzQtYjhiOS00ZDNkLWIyNmItMTMwMGM1NzcwNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGUxZTM4NzQtYjhiOS00ZDNkLWIyNmItMTMwMGM1NzcwNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bram Stoker's Dracula"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000213/","name":"Winona Ryder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053492/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831290/","name":"Bram Stoker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

The last viewing wasn't as scary, but maybe I was distracted by seeing this on DVD for the first time, which enhanced the visuals and added some nice 5.1surround sound.\n\nAt two hours and 10 minutes, it's a bit long but there are very few lulls, if any. Gary Oldham gives his normal intense performance as Dracula and it never hurts to have Anthony Hopkins in the film. \n\nThe only negative I found was Keannu Reeves, who sounds a bit wooden in his lines. Is it my imagination, or is he a terrible actor? Maybe it's just his voice. Nonetheless, Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Sadie Frost and Bill Campbell all give good support to this film which is a real feast for the senses.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":202890,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"1992-11-13","keywords":"dracula,vampire,horror movie remake,monster sex,female vampire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bram Stoker's Dracula","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3978142745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGUxZTM4NzQtYjhiOS00ZDNkLWIyNmItMTMwMGM1NzcwNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGUxZTM4NzQtYjhiOS00ZDNkLWIyNmItMTMwMGM1NzcwNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bram Stoker's Dracula","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000213/","name":"Winona Ryder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053492/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831290/","name":"Bram Stoker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

The movie that he (personally) shot in five countries over a three week period with a cast, crew and equipment that fit in one van, a film which he put together for under $500,000 made over $4 million worldwide. Edwards was rewarded with the opportunity to direct 2014's "Godzilla" reboot. Critics and audiences, who gave "Monsters" generally positive reviews, were rewarded with a sequel, "Monsters: Dark Continent" (R, 1:59). But before we talk about whether the sequel really qualifies as a reward, let's set the stage for the second film by taking a quick look back at the first.\n\nThe story of the original "Monsters" has NASA bringing samples of possible living organisms back from one of Jupiter's moons, only to inadvertently introduce Earth to a new species that is larger and deadlier than anything currently on the planet. The Monsters end up spreading throughout northern Mexico and a quarantine of that half of the country is planned. The focus of the film is the efforts of a photojournalist to get his employer's daughter safely out of Mexico and back to the U.S. without getting killed by the monsters or trapped in the quarantine zone. The sequel picks up about ten years after the first film ends and has all new characters in a completely different setting and with a very different plot.\n\nThe production schedule for "Godzilla" prevented Edwards from directing "Monsters: Dark Continent" (although he did serve as Executive Producer) and the sequel's writers, Jay Basu and Tom Green (the latter making his directorial debut with this film), made the sequel about the soldiers who are fighting the monsters. These creatures are about 300 feet tall and look like a spider, an octopus and a cockroach somehow all made a baby together and it was shot up with more steroids than every professional baseball and football player on the planet could use in a lifetime. No longer confined to Mexico, these creatures have become a world-wide problem. The U.S. military is trying to bomb the monsters into oblivion, but, at least in the Middle East, the collateral damage from those bombing campaigns has created a dangerous new insurgency that troops on the ground are needed to quell. As in the original film, the follow-up is mostly a story of human survival, with the monsters practically fading into the background (a point that some praise, but many criticize). The main focus is on a squad of Soldiers from Detroit who end up fighting the local insurgency under the battle-hardened Staff Sergeant Noah Frater (Johnny Harris). The member of the squad with which Frater ends up spending the most time is Private Michael Parkes (Sam Keely). Parkes is as scared as Frater is determined. Although we see the squad on patrol, and even killing one of the monsters with the small arms that they carry, most of the action takes place on a mission to rescue four fellow soldiers who are believed to be trapped by the insurgents. As is always the case in combat, these young soldiers have to depend on each other and on the wisdom of their leaders if they are to survive. And, as is often the case in war movies, inexperience clashes with experience, idealism clashes with reality and each soldier has to defeat his fear before he can ever hope to defeat the enemy. This film is a combination of "The Hurt Locker", "Saving Private Ryan", "Platoon" and "Starship Troopers", but with much more intensity.\n\n"Monsters: Dark Continent" delivers in terms of the emotions experienced by soldiers in high-stress situations, but that's all it does. For one thing, everything about the marketing of the film – the title, the movie poster, the trailers – is misleading. Based on the title, I expected combat in the deepest, darkest jungles of Africa (maybe like a modern version of "Predator"), not a story set in the villages of the part of northern Africa that is better described as part of the Middle East. Based on what I saw and heard before seeing this movie, I also expected lots of battles against, you know – monsters. The monsters really are gigantic, frightening, bad-tempered destruction machines, but they are mainly relegated to the role of background scenery. We see the insurgents take more lives than the creatures of the film's title. In the few scenes where we observe the monsters up close, we mainly just see them destroying a few buildings, when we can tell that they're capable of so much more. (Oh, the tragedy of wasted monster potential.) Even though I don't feel like I got what I paid for, I was impressed with the performances of the actors playing soldiers, but that wasn't enough for me  or maybe it was too much. The action showing each man beneath the warrior was so incredibly intense that I'm hard-pressed to call this movie "entertaining" and the over-grown creepy-crawlies which could have added a lot to the story were largely MIA.

Willis-Aiello duets of Bing Crosby's "Swinging on a Star" and Paul Anka's "Side by Side" are a bit of fun in an otherwise mixed bag.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1991-05-24","keywords":"time bomb,neo screwball comedy,worst picture razzie winner,character name as title,getting out of jail","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hudson Hawk","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224029977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5MWQyZjktYmYwOS00MjNkLWFlMTUtNGY4ZjBjYTk1MDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5MWQyZjktYmYwOS00MjNkLWFlMTUtNGY4ZjBjYTk1MDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000732/","name":"Danny Aiello","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000510/","name":"Andie MacDowell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499724/","name":"Michael Lehmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019968/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061794/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469234/","name":"Robert Kraft","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The main character of the film has a hard time trying to find it at first, for his destiny lies somewhere upon the seemingly non-existent highway.\n\nPeople looking for "Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road" may have just as hard a time looking for the movie itself, as it was not theatrically released, has not been released on DVD, but continues to circulate around small theaters and film festivals since 2002, in search of more eager viewers who will no doubt be both surprised and inspired by the film's truthfulness and sense of morals.\n\nYet "Interstate 60" plays like anything but a Surgeon General's warning. It isn't as openly strict or hard-nosed. It has a sort of subtle warning inside it that lets the viewer decide what it is about. It's a film that stays with you after it's over, and that's a rare thing these days.\n\nIt all starts with a rich kid named Neal Oliver (James Marsden, "X-Men"). Neal's 22nd birthday has just arrived, and with it a shiny-red BMW sports car, with the license plate specially modeled after his father's own personal motto. In fact, the entire convertible seems to be modeled after Neal's father's own tastes. "I woulda killed to have something like this when I was your age," his dad mutters. We have a feeling he really would have, too.\n\nNeal makes a wish for his birthday, to find a meaning to his life. It is overheard by an odd man named O.W. Grant (full name: One Wish Grant), who decides to grant Neal his wish - by sending a painter's bucket flying from above, only to come to a stop on Neal's skull.\n\nOut of it for a while, Neal wakes up again and finds his perception noticeably different. He notices things he never noticed before; his senses are more acute. A strange doctor named Ray (Christopher Lloyd) explains a thing or two about perception and blindness to Neal, before Neal finds out there is no doctor on the staff at the hospital named Ray (though that seems a bit odd, don't you think?).\n\nNeal meets Ray again in a skyscraper, where Ray gives Neal a job to transport a small briefcase to Denvar (yes, DenVAR), a small town located along I-60. Neal reluctantly agrees to go on this journey in hopes of finding a girl he can't rid his mind of, and so he finally locates this nonexistent highway. Along his journey he once again meets O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), as well as Laura (Amy Jo Johnson), a woman seeking as much sex as possible; a cop (Kurt Russell) in a small drug-infested town; an ex-advertising agent played by Chris Cooper; and finally he finds the girl of his dreams (literally), Lynn (Amy Smart). Along his journey, Neal comes to terms with himself and who he really is, and though this is predictable the way the film gets the message across is more than ingenious.\n\nThe writer and director of the film is Bob Gale, the man most people will always remember as the creator and sole writer of the three "Back to the Future" films. Gale tried his hand at directing a few times, including the 1995 "interfilm" called "Mr. Payback," which I have not seen but have heard is a supposedly horrid excuse for a film. "Interstate 60" is not - it is a cleverly-written little film that avoided being released into the mainstream, and for a reason: It didn't want to become Hollywoodized. It hasn't. And it shows.\n\n"Interstate 60" is unmistakably a low-budget film, but it is all the better for it. It has some important messages that really should be seen by everyone. In a time when films like "Gigli" are invading the film market, this is a breath of fresh air, a step towards a better side of film-making, a side with morals for today's youth and future generations.\n\nThere are some great messages in this film, it's a shame that the majority of moviegoers and families seeking quality films will never even see this film, much less hear about it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31071,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-09-10","keywords":"road trip,alternate reality,magic 8 ball,road movie,time warp","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005188/","name":"James Marsden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000621/","name":"Kurt Russell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301826/","name":"Bob Gale"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022335/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040305/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039180/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301826/","name":"Bob Gale"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But I have to say, seriously though, it was just OK. Not going to be on Roeper's 2006 picks, but good enough for a Sunday afternoon on Showtime. If you go see it, I would recommend this to put you in the right spirit; alcohol and a packed theatre. The movie is funny but not clever. You definitely need a little something to wash it down with. There's a lot of bad herpes jokes, guys calling each other fags, and a painfully bad callback involving a guy vomiting. The jokes are abundant though and for every miss there's a solid hit or two. \n\nMy major complaint with the movie is the sense that it was missing something or parts where I felt there was missed opportunity. Every scene seemed to play like the next and I think it would have been cool to see something that was set apart and memorable. For example a fantasy/dream/passout sequence with Artie in a major league game with bikini chicks handing him beers at the plate and one of the Yankee's pitching to him, but it's a softball. I don't know, something like that. If not that, they could of had a really good crazy prank scene somewhere in the half way through to take you away from the main plot for 5 minutes. Along the lines of the horse in the deans office in Animal House, or the police car in American Graffiti. Just something to contrast with Italians tossing around softballs and drinking in a bar.\n\nAs for Artie, he was great for the role of "Artie" and after 20 minutes you easy got lost in the character, forgetting the Stern show aspect. Forgetting of course they named the character Artie, gave him a girlfriend who he can't commit to, had him drink too much, smoke too much, and have issues with his father's death. Nice Stretch. Why not give him a Sirius t-shirt?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7904,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Sport"],"datePublished":"2006-09-15","keywords":"adult son lives with his mother,adult child lives with mother,softball,baseball,beer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Beer League","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3015246105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMyYjNjMzUtZTllOC00OTM3LTg0MjMtNDg3ZThlZmUzODRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMyYjNjMzUtZTllOC00OTM3LTg0MjMtNDg3ZThlZmUzODRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Echo Bridge Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005119/","name":"Artie Lange"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220867/","name":"Anthony DeSando"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780980/","name":"Frank Sebastiano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0135558/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232025/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0166069/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780980/","name":"Frank Sebastiano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005119/","name":"Artie Lange"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But I have to say, seriously though, it was just OK. Not going to be on Roeper's 2006 picks, but good enough for a Sunday afternoon on Showtime. If you go see it, I would recommend this to put you in the right spirit; alcohol and a packed theatre. The movie is funny but not clever. You definitely need a little something to wash it down with. There's a lot of bad herpes jokes, guys calling each other fags, and a painfully bad callback involving a guy vomiting. The jokes are abundant though and for every miss there's a solid hit or two. \n\nMy major complaint with the movie is the sense that it was missing something or parts where I felt there was missed opportunity. Every scene seemed to play like the next and I think it would have been cool to see something that was set apart and memorable. For example a fantasy/dream/passout sequence with Artie in a major league game with bikini chicks handing him beers at the plate and one of the Yankee's pitching to him, but it's a softball. I don't know, something like that. If not that, they could of had a really good crazy prank scene somewhere in the half way through to take you away from the main plot for 5 minutes. Along the lines of the horse in the deans office in Animal House, or the police car in American Graffiti. Just something to contrast with Italians tossing around softballs and drinking in a bar.\n\nAs for Artie, he was great for the role of "Artie" and after 20 minutes you easy got lost in the character, forgetting the Stern show aspect. Forgetting of course they named the character Artie, gave him a girlfriend who he can't commit to, had him drink too much, smoke too much, and have issues with his father's death. Nice Stretch. Why not give him a Sirius t-shirt?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7904,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Sport"],"datePublished":"2006-09-15","keywords":"adult son lives with his mother,adult child lives with mother,softball,baseball,beer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Beer League","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3015246105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMyYjNjMzUtZTllOC00OTM3LTg0MjMtNDg3ZThlZmUzODRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMyYjNjMzUtZTllOC00OTM3LTg0MjMtNDg3ZThlZmUzODRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Echo Bridge Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005119/","name":"Artie Lange","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220867/","name":"Anthony DeSando"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780980/","name":"Frank Sebastiano"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0135558/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232025/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0166069/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780980/","name":"Frank Sebastiano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005119/","name":"Artie Lange"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Everything I heard left me feeling like yeah, OK, I'm going for Denzel. Denzel vs. Clive Owen will be interesting.\n\nFrom the first shots and opening credits, you are submerged in artistic vision, and a finely honed piece of work the likes of which I haven't seen in years. I'd almost give this one a ten.. and I don't hand out tens freely. I do not want to spoil this. You have to walk in cold, and let this film grab you by the short and curlies.\n\nThis is one film where there isn't a spare frame or wasted cheap shot. Every zinger zings, and there are laughs too, laughs at merciful intervals to break the tension and remind an audience on the edges of its seats that movie-going's supposed to be entertaining, dammit. The cinematography is brilliant, and the music is fantastic - true cinematic score, true genius.

Everything I heard left me feeling like yeah, OK, I'm going for Denzel. Denzel vs. Clive Owen will be interesting.\n\nFrom the first shots and opening credits, you are submerged in artistic vision, and a finely honed piece of work the likes of which I haven't seen in years. I'd almost give this one a ten.. and I don't hand out tens freely. I do not want to spoil this. You have to walk in cold, and let this film grab you by the short and curlies.\n\nThis is one film where there isn't a spare frame or wasted cheap shot. Every zinger zings, and there are laughs too, laughs at merciful intervals to break the tension and remind an audience on the edges of its seats that movie-going's supposed to be entertaining, dammit. The cinematography is brilliant, and the music is fantastic - true cinematic score, true genius. I can't praise this one enough.\n\nChristopher Plummer is superb, in what is (perhaps coincidentally) an ironic bit of casting. Jodie Foster rises to a challenging persona with aplomb and ease, and my only complaint of the entire exercise is that her character's name 'Madeline White' is perhaps a little cliché.

I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Danny escapes his troubles in the adrenaline-pumping fantasies of the cinema, especially the JACK SLATER film series.\n\nThe JACK SLATER movies spoof the action franchises popular at the time, like DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON. Jack Slater is the ultimate badass, working for the LAPD but doing things his own way. Chomping on cigars, kicking down doors. Going where other cops wouldn't dare.\n\nIn the film, the star of the JACK SLATER series is real-world action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is LAST ACTION HERO's biggest meta concept as Schwarzenegger stars as a parody of himself (playing both Arnold and Arnold-as-Jack).\n\nWith the help of an enchanted ticket given to Nick by the famed escape artist Harry Houdini, Danny is able to enter the world of the newest JACK SLATER movie and help Jack beat the bad guys. It should be a dream come true, but instead of just going along with it, Danny tries to shatter Jack's worldview by proving that he "lives" in a fictional movie universe, full of improbable explosions, predictable one-liners, and physics-defying stunts. Danny calls out Jack for using well-known Arnold catchphrases like "I'll be back" and tries to explain the absurdity of Jack's LAPD colleague being an animated anthropomorphic cat (voiced by Danny DeVito). Jack thinks Danny's crazy (obviously), but Danny's uncanny knowledge of secret information (gleaned from watching prior installments of the JACK SLATER series, as well as the opening scenes from this one) gets him assigned as Jack's partner, in true buddy movie fashion.\n\nDanny is always completely self-aware about being the comic sidekick in an action movie. He knows Jack Slater's world is governed by plot contrivances and movie clichés. He even calls out the villain for monologuing. Austin O'Brien doesn't do a bad job in the film, but he does start to get on my nerves a little.\n\nThe fun really starts once the villain (Charles Dance) gets ahold of the magic ticket and enters the real world, a place where heroes can bleed and bad guys can actually win. Jack and Danny track him to the star-studded premiere of JACK SLATER IV, where fictional hero Jack Slater comes face-to-face with Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger (among other fun celebrity cameos).\n\nThe satire of LAST ACTION HERO is on-point. Besides getting Arnold Schwarzenegger to spoof himself, the movie is directed by John McTiernan, who directed DIE HARD (1988), and the screenplay was co-written by Shane Black, who wrote LETHAL WEAPON (1987). The top-notch pedigree surely helps sell the film's high concept.\n\nThe script has a lot of potential for the right actor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger seems like he's having a lot of fun with the material. It wouldn't be the same without a real A-list action star playing Jack Slater. Arnold has a good sense of humor about himself and seems to enjoy playing with his image.\n\nOne of the best in-jokes for serious movie buffs comes early in the film when Danny's English teacher, played by Joan Plowright, introduces a clip from Laurence Olivier's HAMLET (1948), suggesting that the students might know the British acting legend from his late-career role of Zeus in CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) or an older TV commercial for Polaroid. Plowright is, of course, Olivier's widow.\n\nIn addition to HAMLET, the movie includes nods to Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957), Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA_(1992), and WITNESS (1985) with Harrison Ford. In the movie world Danny warns Jack not to trust his FBI buddy John Practice because he is played by F. Murray Abraham, the guy who "killed Mozart" (an allusion to AMADEUS (1984)). A Humphrey Bogart-type detective in a trench coat appears in one of the JACK SLATER police station scenes. And since "Arnold Schwarzenegger" can't exist in the fictional world of Jack Slater, his famous role in the TERMINATOR films is played instead by Sylvester Stallone.\n\nThe JACK SLATER action is hilariously over-the-top and stylized, satirizing Hollywood action blockbusters and further contrasting the fantasy world of the silver screen with the real world Danny knows. The original story, developed by Zak Penn and Adam Leff, is quite clever and the film, unconventional as it is, succeeds because of its uniqueness. The movie's a lot of fun and there are plenty of Easter eggs for hardcore cinephiles."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1993-06-18","keywords":"villain,taxi,funeral,video store,child drives a car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Last Action Hero","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1823080729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlMTc2NWMtZTMyNy00MWJjLWFjMTAtZGRmMjQ4ODAwYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlMTc2NWMtZTMyNy00MWJjLWFjMTAtZGRmMjQ4ODAwYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000719/","name":"F.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun! This is entertainment, after all. My rating: 7 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-23","keywords":"character name as series title,surname as series title,one word series title,2010s,reboot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1395771/","name":"Lucas Till","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1159702/","name":"Tristin Mays","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2058713/","name":"Justin Hires"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0504531/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0957453/","name":"Lee David Zlotoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006997/","name":"Peter M.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun! This is entertainment, after all.

I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun! This is entertainment, after all.

There aren't a lot of movies like this, definitely not many mainstream ones, but I'd put it in the same category as "Special" with Michael Rappaport playing a total loser who develops bizarre super powers.

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"politics,political thriller,u.s. president,political assassination,white house","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3461588761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001173/","name":"Aaron Eckhart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332840/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4950667/","name":"Creighton Rothenberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4951717/","name":"Katrin Benedikt"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy.

Tarantino, Scorsese, Kuebrick and many others all share distinct characteristics that make there films recognizable to those serious about cinema. The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?\n\nSummary\n\nBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name "Baby" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is. \n\nReview\n\nPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level. We then proceed to a long tracking shot of Baby navigating to a coffee shop, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful shots of 2017. I never thought Watching someone get coffee would be this entertaining. Wright does a good job from the start of putting us into this kids world while simultaneously showing us why he doesn't belong in it. The casting choices were all good and added different elements to the story. Baby was the only one tied to music physically through his iPod, but each character was choreographed as if they were listening too. The action was shot really well especially the getaway scenes, both on foot and in the car. The car chase scenes are pure brilliance making The Fast and The Furious movies look 2nd tier. Edgar truly kept me engaged and I never felt cheated in any scene. \n\nCons\n\nMuch of the film focused on visuals to the point where I felt some characters were a tad bit flat. Subtracting Baby and Doc (Kevin Spacy), I felt the others could have had a little more substance. Some of their decisions and actions felt somewhat robotic in my opinion. With that being said Buddy (Hamm) and Batts (Foxx) did shine in a couple of scenes due to them being quality actors. With this being said please understand that even this didn't ruin this movie due to them still being entertaining characters. \n\nLastly the only other minor issue I had was the romance. Although there was nothing wrong with the acting or chemistry between the characters, it was just a little difficult to believe or get invested in.\n\nConclusion/Grade\n\nWhat makes Baby Driver great is that it is a unique experience and is visually stunning. Edgar Wright does a great job of blending action, suspense, romance and comedy making it one of the most enjoyable films of 2017. \n\n8.1/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":475579,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-06-28","keywords":"hearing impairment,robbery,chase,bank,heist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""TeKillYah" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2482288921","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3NWYxZTItZDIzYi00ZjllLWI5NGMtNjZjZDM2OWI2OTBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3NWYxZTItZDIzYi00ZjllLWI5NGMtNjZjZDM2OWI2OTBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After being coerced into working for a crime boss, a young getaway driver finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5052065/","name":"Ansel Elgort"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1256532/","name":"Jon Bernthal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358316/","name":"Jon Hamm"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942367/","name":"Edgar Wright"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194736/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942367/","name":"Edgar Wright"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The premise is so simple that it's almost a parody of movie pitches (Homer Simpson's line was "I saw this movie about a bus that had to SPEED around a city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'."). Fortunately this film came to be much better than the sum of its parts, and it's deservedly remembered as one of the most entertaining films of the 90s.\n\nWhat distinguishes Speed is its humanity, due in no small part to the character of Annie (Sandra Bullock). The best example of this is the moment when Annie, while driving the bus, thinks she has struck a baby stroller. She becomes so distraught that she lets go of the steering wheel, never mind the fact that she is in charge of driving a bomb-laden bus through the L.A. suburbs. It's one of several moments that draw us into the film by helping us identify with the characters, and it's all the more elegant for its simplicity. This movie isn't complex, but it doesn't claim to be.\n\nThere is a certain irony that Speed succeeds so well on a human level, since Jan de Bont is not generally considered an "actor's director". He started as a cinematographer, and even when he talks about directing he discusses technical aspects and seldom mentions working with actors. Nowhere was this more evident than Speed 2, which pretty much killed his directorial career. Given that, it's all the more remarkable what he pulled off in the original Speed, as everything seemed to come together for him.\n\nThe overall performances really serve this picture well.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0111257, Title: Speed, 
 --- Description: Speed: Directed by Jan de Bont. With Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton. A young police officer must prevent a bomb exploding aboard a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0111257/","name":"Speed","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjc0MjYyN2EtZGRhMy00NzJiLWI2Y2QtYzhiYTU3NzAxNzg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young police officer must prevent a bomb exploding aboard a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0111257/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"jeremyglick","dateCreated":"2005-03-01","inLanguage":"English","name":"Thoroughly entertaining","reviewBody":"Speed is one of my favorite action movies of all time, just a notch below contemporaries like Terminator 2 and Die Hard. The premise is so simple that it's almost a parody of movie pitches (Homer Simpson's line was "I saw this movie about a bus that had to SPEED around a city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'."). Fortunately this film came to be much better than the sum of its parts, and it's deservedly remembered as one of the most entertaining films of the 90s.\n\nWhat distinguishes Speed is its humanity, due in no small part to the character of Annie (Sandra Bullock). The best example of this is the moment when Annie, while driving the bus, thinks she has struck a baby stroller. She becomes so distraught that she lets go of the steering wheel, never mind the fact that she is in charge of driving a bomb-laden bus through the L.A. suburbs. It's one of several moments that draw us into the film by helping us identify with the characters, and it's all the more elegant for its simplicity. This movie isn't complex, but it doesn't claim to be.\n\nThere is a certain irony that Speed succeeds so well on a human level, since Jan de Bont is not generally considered an "actor's director". He started as a cinematographer, and even when he talks about directing he discusses technical aspects and seldom mentions working with actors. Nowhere was this more evident than Speed 2, which pretty much killed his directorial career. Given that, it's all the more remarkable what he pulled off in the original Speed, as everything seemed to come together for him.\n\nThe overall performances really serve this picture well. Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain. Plus he has one of my favorite bad-guy lines of all time (Traven: "You're crazy." Payne: "Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric.").\n\n8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":344038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-06-10","keywords":"bus,bomb,time bomb,public transport,police","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Speed","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126484761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdlYTUxZTEtYTI2Mi00NGFmLWFmN2UtYjljZmE4MzFlM2I0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdlYTUxZTEtYTI2Mi00NGFmLWFmN2UtYjljZmE4MzFlM2I0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "June 10th"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000206/","name":"Keanu Reeves","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000454/","name":"Dennis Hopper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003662/","name":"Graham Yost"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Zieja</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times.

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-20","keywords":"elderly people,worst picture razzie winner,dancing,uncanny valley,singing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2898837273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3716653/","name":"Jason Derulo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355822/","name":"Lee Hall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515908/","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But director John Milius had set out to create something very different: an epic Aryan myth which translated the qualities of Wagnerian opera to cinema, and in large part he succeeded. \n\nConan has a sweeping epic feel, and is heavily dependent upon and driven by its setting and music to a degree that is very rare. As important as the deeds of the legendary hero, which are shown in brief and violent spurts of action, are the place and the culture that shaped that legend. The journey that created the myth, in short, is equal to the myth itself, and this is the logic and justification for the setting-heavy approach taken by Milius. And Basil Poledouris' wonderful music, which starts out Wagnerian and brassy, but adds middle Eastern touches as Conan's journey takes him in that direction, tracks along with Conan to show up the breadth of his epic journey while celebrating his heroic achievements. \n\nUltimately the story that gets told is somewhat less worthy of Milius' Wagnerian ambitions than are the music and the visuals, but the overall results more than justify the effort, especially when compared to the Italian sword and sandal knock-offs which followed this much copied but never equaled classic of the fantasy genre.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1982-04-15","keywords":"evil sorcerer,cult,warlord,cult film,eating human flesh","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi488422937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFlYzYwNTMtZmIzYi00MWZhLTgwYjMtM2I2ODllMDc5OTI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFlYzYwNTMtZmIzYi00MWZhLTgwYjMtM2I2ODllMDc5OTI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000469/","name":"James Earl Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001884/","name":"Max von Sydow"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587518/","name":"John Milius"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006728/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0397574/","name":"Robert E.

But director John Milius had set out to create something very different: an epic Aryan myth which translated the qualities of Wagnerian opera to cinema, and in large part he succeeded. \n\nConan has a sweeping epic feel, and is heavily dependent upon and driven by its setting and music to a degree that is very rare. As important as the deeds of the legendary hero, which are shown in brief and violent spurts of action, are the place and the culture that shaped that legend. The journey that created the myth, in short, is equal to the myth itself, and this is the logic and justification for the setting-heavy approach taken by Milius. And Basil Poledouris' wonderful music, which starts out Wagnerian and brassy, but adds middle Eastern touches as Conan's journey takes him in that direction, tracks along with Conan to show up the breadth of his epic journey while celebrating his heroic achievements. \n\nUltimately the story that gets told is somewhat less worthy of Milius' Wagnerian ambitions than are the music and the visuals, but the overall results more than justify the effort, especially when compared to the Italian sword and sandal knock-offs which followed this much copied but never equaled classic of the fantasy genre.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1982-04-15","keywords":"evil sorcerer,cult,warlord,cult film,eating human flesh","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi488422937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFlYzYwNTMtZmIzYi00MWZhLTgwYjMtM2I2ODllMDc5OTI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFlYzYwNTMtZmIzYi00MWZhLTgwYjMtM2I2ODllMDc5OTI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000469/","name":"James Earl Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001884/","name":"Max von Sydow"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587518/","name":"John Milius"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006728/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0397574/","name":"Robert E.

Then for the next hour, it turns into an animated film which stays close to the novel The Futurological Congress, a completely surreal experience.\n\nThe first stands as a commentary on how the film industry is exploiting artists and the fascist standpoint of the studios along with all the ethical and moral conundrums. But it's when the animated section starts that we understand that it's actually a much wider problem we are seeing here, it's not just the film industry but the whole world that is forgetting the true nature of being human and is embracing the virtual world of lies.\n\nAlthough it throws some of its concept on your face and may feel a little over ambitious to some it's an epic journey that is truly a unique experience.

Then for the next hour, it turns into an animated film which stays close to the novel The Futurological Congress, a completely surreal experience.\n\nThe first stands as a commentary on how the film industry is exploiting artists and the fascist standpoint of the studios along with all the ethical and moral conundrums. But it's when the animated section starts that we understand that it's actually a much wider problem we are seeing here, it's not just the film industry but the whole world that is forgetting the true nature of being human and is embracing the virtual world of lies.\n\nAlthough it throws some of its concept on your face and may feel a little over ambitious to some it's an epic journey that is truly a unique experience.

Though 20 minutes longer, it successfully wall - papers over the main points of criticism of the original.

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic.

He is back. I was bored of the idea of another Anti-Nazi film but I'm telling you it's not. This is a film about pride, bravery, principles, choice, humanity. As usual from Malick: great shots and cinematography, great monologues, such an incredible soundtrack that deserved an Oscar nomination (also the cinematography). But still the editing got me confused at some scenes, it was a weakness point. The cast are all good especially August Diehl &amp; Valerie Pachner. No cliches, no heroes, just a simple man whose opinion won't affect the war and no one would listen to it, but he is still standing for his principles to make himself and his family proud of himself as a human. A Hidden Life of a hidden family. Some people could get bored quickly so it's simply not for them. They have a lot of films for their taste. It's ok everyone has a taste.

He is back. I was bored of the idea of another Anti-Nazi film but I'm telling you it's not. This is a film about pride, bravery, principles, choice, humanity. As usual from Malick: great shots and cinematography, great monologues, such an incredible soundtrack that deserved an Oscar nomination (also the cinematography). But still the editing got me confused at some scenes, it was a weakness point. The cast are all good especially August Diehl &amp; Valerie Pachner. No cliches, no heroes, just a simple man whose opinion won't affect the war and no one would listen to it, but he is still standing for his principles to make himself and his family proud of himself as a human. A Hidden Life of a hidden family. Some people could get bored quickly so it's simply not for them. They have a lot of films for their taste. It's ok everyone has a taste. Just enjoy and let people enjoy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21348,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-01-17","keywords":"world war two,nazi,anti nazism,death penalty,third reich","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Select Theaters Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4230135577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225944/","name":"August Diehl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5638960/","name":"Valerie Pachner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800314/","name":"Maria Simon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0630986/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"duration":"PT2H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Had Pierre Curie not been killed as he was, it is likely that he would have eventually died of the effects of radiation, as did his wife, their daughter Irène, and her husband Frédéric Joliot.\n\nI'm a great fan of Rosamund Pike and enjoyed her performance in this very dull average film I suggest read the book or watch the far superior 1943 film with Greer Garson "Madam Curie." and Walter Pidgeon as Pierre.\n\nIt was nominated for 7 Oscars and a much better film directed by Mervyn LeRoy and based on Ève Curie the daughter of Madam Curie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15015,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-06-15","keywords":"scientist,physicist,science,physics,chemistry","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1577631257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxMzMxYWQtZjM5Mi00ZGYzLTgyNzUtZWFjNDQ5NTliYjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxMzMxYWQtZjM5Mi00ZGYzLTgyNzUtZWFjNDQ5NTliYjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"A story of the scientific and romantic passions of Marie Sklodowska-Curie (Polish scientist) and Pierre Curie, and the reverberation of their discoveries throughout the 20th century.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275431/","name":"Yvette Feuer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1597296/","name":"Mirjam Novak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2277869/","name":"Marjane Satrapi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2113666/","name":"Jack Thorne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9706688/","name":"Lauren Redniss"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Throughout the show unless you switch off your brain completely, you keep asking yourself "why are they doing this?" and the only answer is "so the show can go on with characters overcoming unrealistic self-imposed difficulties". Parts of the plot are so generic and americanesque that they do not fit in within Russian reality at all, but are otherwise easily recognizable. Hotel clerk woman is a copycat of Saul's girlfriend for example. Script is filled with such glaring holes, that even taking it for a dark unfunny comedy doesn't help. Actors seem smarter than the script and it appears you can sometimes see them cringe... Bortich is her usual blank-o-wood expression range, same for the protagonist's what'shername daughter. But it wouldn't be complete as a pile of ... excitement without feminist angle. Pretty much all men are incapable flaccid trash, while all women are almighty... Makes me not ever want to let a pregnant woman take my seat on a public transport - she is apparently stronger than me and doesn't need it... Hell, she could probably just walk any distance... It's filmed alright though.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-29","keywords":"flower","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586485/","name":"Anna Mikhalkova","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1148964/","name":"Evgeniy Grishkovets","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230507/","name":"Tatyana Dogileva"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0725950/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

    <desc lang="pl">W sierpniu 2020 roku szkocki zespół rockowy Biffy Clyro w Barrowland Ballroom w Glasgow po raz pierwszy zagrał utwory ze swojego nowego, znakomicie przyjętego albumu "A Celebration of Endings". Występ, który odbył się w czasie pandemii, musiał mieć dość kameralny charakter, ale mimo to muzycy przygotowali spektakularny show. Udowodnili, że wbrew niełatwym okolicznościom granie muzyki na żywo wciąż ma wielki sens.</desc>

The premise is so simple that it's almost a parody of movie pitches (Homer Simpson's line was "I saw this movie about a bus that had to SPEED around a city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'."). Fortunately this film came to be much better than the sum of its parts, and it's deservedly remembered as one of the most entertaining films of the 90s.\n\nWhat distinguishes Speed is its humanity, due in no small part to the character of Annie (Sandra Bullock). The best example of this is the moment when Annie, while driving the bus, thinks she has struck a baby stroller. She becomes so distraught that she lets go of the steering wheel, never mind the fact that she is in charge of driving a bomb-laden bus through the L.A. suburbs. It's one of several moments that draw us into the film by helping us identify with the characters, and it's all the more elegant for its simplicity. This movie isn't complex, but it doesn't claim to be.\n\nThere is a certain irony that Speed succeeds so well on a human level, since Jan de Bont is not generally considered an "actor's director". He started as a cinematographer, and even when he talks about directing he discusses technical aspects and seldom mentions working with actors. Nowhere was this more evident than Speed 2, which pretty much killed his directorial career. Given that, it's all the more remarkable what he pulled off in the original Speed, as everything seemed to come together for him.\n\nThe overall performances really serve this picture well. Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain. Plus he has one of my favorite bad-guy lines of all time (Traven: "You're crazy." Payne: "Poor people are crazy, Jack.

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-20","keywords":"elderly people,worst picture razzie winner,dancing,uncanny valley,singing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2898837273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3716653/","name":"Jason Derulo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355822/","name":"Lee Hall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515908/","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout.

It's only about 80 minutes long, but that's about right for a Tom Green movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12890,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2002-09-13","keywords":"man wears eyeglasses,harvard,black comedy,crying during sex,voice over narration","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stealing Harvard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4237989913","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWIzMmYwNTQtYWM2Ni00NWM2LWJmODMtY2ZkNWE3OWJhZTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWIzMmYwNTQtYWM2Ni00NWM2LWJmODMtY2ZkNWE3OWJhZTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Stealing Harvard","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005134/","name":"Jason Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338381/","name":"Tom Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005182/","name":"Leslie Mann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0567126/","name":"Bruce McCulloch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0405271/","name":"Martin Hynes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865847/","name":"Peter Tolan"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Set against a backdrop of increasing frustrations by young British women with their second class status, which they perceive to be epitomised by the vacuous sexploitation of women in the "Miss World Pageant"; we see Keira Knightley ("Sally") and a feisty Jesse Buckley ("Jo") decide to take the fight to the patriarchal establishment as they plot to disrupt the show and hopefully shame the powers that be (men and women) behind it. Whilst it certainly has credentials when dealing with objectification; it fails to even attempt to seriously reconcile how aspirations amongst women (and, perhaps more importantly, women of colour) from different parts of the world - and remember we are talking 1970, here - were not necessarily in alignment with the rather linear white middle-class protest agenda presented to us here. It has all the substance of a student rebellion movie, and that's a shame. Buckley is good, and Phyllis Logan as Knightley's mother "Evelyn" brings some sense of the conflict faced by older women vis-à-vis career v family; but all in all, this film is at best a lukewarm hors d'oeuvres for the true, ongoing, achievements of the "women's lib" movement...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7105,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-03-13","keywords":"1970s,beauty contest,women's liberation,sexism,feminist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2456141337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5NDBkMGMtYjcyOS00NTVkLWJjNjMtNWM4M2YyMjU4ZjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5NDBkMGMtYjcyOS00NTVkLWJjNjMtNWM4M2YyMjU4ZjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of women hatch a plan to disrupt the 1970 Miss World beauty competition in London."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1813221/","name":"Gugu Mbatha-Raw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2976580/","name":"Jessie Buckley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1339400/","name":"Philippa Lowthorpe"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022869/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037450/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0292451/","name":"Rebecca Frayn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0960711/","name":"Gaby Chiappe"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Set against a backdrop of increasing frustrations by young British women with their second class status, which they perceive to be epitomised by the vacuous sexploitation of women in the "Miss World Pageant"; we see Keira Knightley ("Sally") and a feisty Jesse Buckley ("Jo") decide to take the fight to the patriarchal establishment as they plot to disrupt the show and hopefully shame the powers that be (men and women) behind it. Whilst it certainly has credentials when dealing with objectification; it fails to even attempt to seriously reconcile how aspirations amongst women (and, perhaps more importantly, women of colour) from different parts of the world - and remember we are talking 1970, here - were not necessarily in alignment with the rather linear white middle-class protest agenda presented to us here. It has all the substance of a student rebellion movie, and that's a shame. Buckley is good, and Phyllis Logan as Knightley's mother "Evelyn" brings some sense of the conflict faced by older women vis-à-vis career v family; but all in all, this film is at best a lukewarm hors d'oeuvres for the true, ongoing, achievements of the "women's lib" movement...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7105,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-03-13","keywords":"1970s,beauty contest,women's liberation,sexism,feminist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2456141337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5NDBkMGMtYjcyOS00NTVkLWJjNjMtNWM4M2YyMjU4ZjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5NDBkMGMtYjcyOS00NTVkLWJjNjMtNWM4M2YyMjU4ZjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of women hatch a plan to disrupt the 1970 Miss World beauty competition in London.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1813221/","name":"Gugu Mbatha-Raw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2976580/","name":"Jessie Buckley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1339400/","name":"Philippa Lowthorpe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037450/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0292451/","name":"Rebecca Frayn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0960711/","name":"Gaby Chiappe"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Kohtunik: Directed by Andres Puustusmaa. With Märt Avandi, Matti Kröger, Matti Kröger, Sakari Kuosmanen. The Judge (Mait Malmsten) is a man who represents strict rules and laws in the courtroom. However, his own personal life is an absolute mess. After the judge makes a decision to give a long prison sentence to a woman, the woman's brother (Märt Avandi) starts following the judge to change his mind about the verdict. The judge stays adamant. The verdict is final. A conflict takes place between the men, resulting in the judge suddenly becoming a criminal himself.

Tim runs towards being a dad, while Zoe runs away from being a mum. Terrified that her life won't be her own anymore, Zoe is still determined to tick off a list of their wildest dreams before the baby arrives. Zoe's increasing denial about her impending birth pushes her, and her relationship, to the limit. BABY DONE is a semi-autobiographical story inspired by the filmmakers' own reaction to starting a family.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4194124/","name":"Rose Matafeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507535/","name":"Matthew Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120593/","name":"Emily Barclay"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3555793/","name":"Curtis Vowell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0537672/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3089836/","name":"Sophie Henderson"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.\n\nYes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.\n\nThe writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.\n\nIf your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie.

He shares initials with Serge Gainsbourg and counts among his accomplishments Spanish versions of Gainsbourg songs. His friends call him Francés, Frenchman. He has problems managing his anger; he had brushes with the law, has been sentenced to community service and is one short step away from doing time. A subject that has obvious possibilities in the hands of a competent scriptwriter.\n\nPeretti is a capable and experienced actor with a flair for comedy which bodes well for the subject. Unfortunately, expectations are frustrated. The first part of the movie is devoid of wit (except perhaps for the first scene) and Peretti is wasted.

He shares initials with Serge Gainsbourg and counts among his accomplishments Spanish versions of Gainsbourg songs. His friends call him Francés, Frenchman. He has problems managing his anger; he had brushes with the law, has been sentenced to community service and is one short step away from doing time. A subject that has obvious possibilities in the hands of a competent scriptwriter.\n\nPeretti is a capable and experienced actor with a flair for comedy which bodes well for the subject. Unfortunately, expectations are frustrated. The first part of the movie is devoid of wit (except perhaps for the first scene) and Peretti is wasted. So is Julianne Nicholson, saddled with a thankless role; her presence in Buenos Aires is never explained and she seems to be around just to lust for Sergio. But the worst is yet to come; midway through, the movie jumps awkwardly into the crime genre and all credibility is thrown overboard.\n\nThe final insult: Gainsbourg's songs are sappy enough, but their River Plate versions are much worse.

I did feel as though "Spinster" lagged at some points and wondered if scenes could've been altered or re-worked. Some of the jokes didn't land as you'd expect them too but it's still a decent enough film to get through on a gloomy evening.\n\nFollow @snobmedia for more reviews!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":707,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-08-07","keywords":"loneliness","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744275481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjkxMzIyMjMtYzhlZS00MDBiLWEyZjAtZDgzYTRhYzRjNzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjkxMzIyMjMtYzhlZS00MDBiLWEyZjAtZDgzYTRhYzRjNzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After her partner breaks up with her on her 39th birthday, Gaby tackles her fears of loneliness as well as preconceptions of what it means for a woman to be single.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2003229/","name":"Chelsea Peretti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448861/","name":"Susan Kent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9694289/","name":"Nadia Tonen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0233555/","name":"Andrea Dorfman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0451089/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0383512/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0297253/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1251179/","name":"Jennifer Deyell"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has an interesting concept, an app that can tell you when you'll die with unbelievable accuracy. That's fun, right?

One its people, an old woman, preserving the memory of his late husband, being happy when her daughter and granddaughter visits her, having need of a little pig in a sort of version of Pig story by Ion Creanga , punishing the killers of her granddaughter in a manner remembering The Virgin Spring by Ingmar Bergman , having the chance than a rich man being very generous with her.

Indeed this is a rare gem in cinema. I give this 9 out of 10. The script is tight, the music score good and the performances are amazing.\n\nIts a simple story of a school teacher who is forced to retire. He finds no comfort in his retirement as he is denied his pension and there is absolutely no one in the school who is sad to see him go. Living with an unfaithful life, this school teacher lives a lonely life. Never to bow down to anyone and nor letting anyone sympathise with him, he portrays a classic and rare case of a strong human being.\n\nAs i say this, it was sad to see him break down when a kid showers him a rare gift of love. If this movie does not touch your soul or move you, then you truly belong to the cold hearted. Keep a handkerchief ready.\n\nPlease watch this movie. It is a masterpiece .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3205,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1994-10-28","keywords":"preparatory school,teacher student relationship,school faculty,retirement,boarding school","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000627/","name":"Greta Scacchi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000546/","name":"Matthew Modine"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001214/","name":"Mike Figgis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052233/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711905/","name":"Terence Rattigan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Indeed this is a rare gem in cinema. I give this 9 out of 10. The script is tight, the music score good and the performances are amazing.\n\nIts a simple story of a school teacher who is forced to retire. He finds no comfort in his retirement as he is denied his pension and there is absolutely no one in the school who is sad to see him go. Living with an unfaithful life, this school teacher lives a lonely life. Never to bow down to anyone and nor letting anyone sympathise with him, he portrays a classic and rare case of a strong human being.\n\nAs i say this, it was sad to see him break down when a kid showers him a rare gift of love. If this movie does not touch your soul or move you, then you truly belong to the cold hearted. Keep a handkerchief ready.\n\nPlease watch this movie. It is a masterpiece .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3205,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1994-10-28","keywords":"preparatory school,teacher student relationship,school faculty,retirement,boarding school","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000627/","name":"Greta Scacchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000546/","name":"Matthew Modine"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001214/","name":"Mike Figgis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052233/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711905/","name":"Terence Rattigan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I haven't watched any Swiss film before, at least to my knowledge?\n\nIt's absolutely amazing. The acting from both Sarah Spale and Luna Mwezi is sublime and extremely believable. At times it's really hard to get through, since the story revolving around Mia and her mom is very sad and somewhat depressing. The daily struggle of the daughter Mia, trying to help her mother, is very touching, although very sad.\n\nI had to stop the movie a few times, just to get a break. Definitely cried through a lot of the tough scenes. I had to remind myself it's "just" a movie, but it felt very real.\n\nAnyways, if you get a chance to watch this movie - I thoroughly recommend you should.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":613,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-11-18","keywords":"mother daughter relationship,coming of age,drug addicted woman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Platzspitzbaby","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1005371161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3768173/","name":"Jerry Hoffmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1282623/","name":"Sarah Spale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457412/","name":"Luna Mwezi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1301190/","name":"Pierre Monnard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075448/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1825205/","name":"André Küttel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457413/","name":"Michelle Halbheer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11979752/","name":"Franziska K.

Apparently only ONE other recommended this? This is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time. I stumbled upon this movie by chance, and decided to give it a try. It was very much worth it!! I haven't watched any Swiss film before, at least to my knowledge?\n\nIt's absolutely amazing. The acting from both Sarah Spale and Luna Mwezi is sublime and extremely believable. At times it's really hard to get through, since the story revolving around Mia and her mom is very sad and somewhat depressing. The daily struggle of the daughter Mia, trying to help her mother, is very touching, although very sad.\n\nI had to stop the movie a few times, just to get a break. Definitely cried through a lot of the tough scenes. I had to remind myself it's "just" a movie, but it felt very real.\n\nAnyways, if you get a chance to watch this movie - I thoroughly recommend you should.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":613,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-11-18","keywords":"mother daughter relationship,coming of age,drug addicted woman","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Platzspitzbaby","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1005371161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3768173/","name":"Jerry Hoffmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1282623/","name":"Sarah Spale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457412/","name":"Luna Mwezi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1301190/","name":"Pierre Monnard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075448/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1825205/","name":"André Küttel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457413/","name":"Michelle Halbheer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11979752/","name":"Franziska K.

However, it lacks artistic direction and balance. Not a contradiction in terms exactly.\n\nfor example, the opening scene shows her being exhibited in a medical seminar and the end of the movie displays her physical remains which would later be put in a Paris Musueum. My point is that the Director could have taken more attention to detail and put the lady into a greater prospective, perhaps a prequel to the main part of the story (the recent Johnny Depp movie 'Dark shadows" a case in point) showing the lady in her tribal land and how she met the Doctor before arriving to England. The explanation in the movie is all too bland and passed over for the most part. The same applied for the ending although there were some explanatory subtitles and compensating visual glimpses of when she was returned to South Africa.\n\nWhat we see in this film is no different from what still goes on in our world today but in a different way. We go-global in order to see the very thing that this humble woman was subjected to and we pay to see it, sometimes on the internet - animals as well as humans - and it is only perhaps in western countries that there are anti-voice against the abuse in circuses.\n\nWe should watch this film and want to be shocked. Unlike the spectators shown throughout the film, we have the benefit of a greater education and enhanced knowledge but abuse such as Saartje Baartman is shown to endure in the movie, goes on to this day.\n\nThere was a lack of cohesion at times in the transition from going London to Paris and then later when Saartje found herself in the Brothels. Yes, she drank and smoked and was inevitably sensitive and temperamental given her real life role play but this is indeed an extraordinary film about an extraordinary woman who is extraordinary for her courage and determination and not so unordinary from any other woman except for her buttocks and her labia, according to the medical scientists.\n\nI certainly enjoyed this film more than the "Hobbit' which bored the pants off me (except for the special effects) and yes 'Venus Noire' is slow and often repetitive but I can share empathy with the Director and in an unkind, cruel, uncomfortable way, this is entertainment.\n\nOn a general note, there is no swearing or offensive violence, despite the harsh treatment Saartje Baartman endured while away from South Africa. Yes, she is mostly naked for large sections of the film and there are a couple of later scenes in Paris where she is in a sexual situation but apart from that, this is not a film for a sexual voyeur and don't expect to see flashes of an unusually large labia because you will not.\n\nThe standard of acting in this film is excellent. I may be wrong here but this is a French film and so good sub-titles in English or language of your choice are important. I suggest that there are a lot of other movies out there who will shock and offend you a whole lot more than this one.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2010-10-27","keywords":"brothel,nudity,racism,exhibition,female nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135788313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MzZhZjUtNmU4MC00NjcxLWI1NDktYTRjNDY1NmVlMDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MzZhZjUtNmU4MC00NjcxLWI1NDktYTRjNDY1NmVlMDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4070086/","name":"Yahima Torres"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414325/","name":"Andre Jacobs"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332709/","name":"Olivier Gourmet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444244/","name":"Abdellatif Kechiche"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022545/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028908/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444244/","name":"Abdellatif Kechiche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480308/","name":"Ghalya Lacroix"}],"duration":"PT2H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the 19th century, a black woman from Africa is on display throughout Europe as an exotic curiosity." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1401643/","name":"Vénus noire","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMwMmVhZTMtOGVlOC00ZGJiLThhNmUtZDhmM2FhY2UwNTUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0ODAyOTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the 19th century, a black woman from Africa is on display throughout Europe as an exotic curiosity.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1401643/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"mrcibubur","dateCreated":"2013-01-02","inLanguage":"English","name":"Extraordinary Film about an Extraordinary Woman","reviewBody":"I finally watched this movie earlier today with a sorrowful heart after first hearing about it a couple of years ago. hard to get it here in Indonesia on DVD, finally got it on two split You Tube downloads.\n\nYes this is not a film for the faint hearted, it is extremely graphic and harsh in its direction to say the least and certainly long at 2 hours 40 minutes (comparable with the Hobbit which I saw on new Years Eve).\n\nThe film is an artistic portrayal of a dignified South African tribal woman who is abused and misled once she arrives first to England and then later to Paris. However, it lacks artistic direction and balance. Not a contradiction in terms exactly.\n\nfor example, the opening scene shows her being exhibited in a medical seminar and the end of the movie displays her physical remains which would later be put in a Paris Musueum. My point is that the Director could have taken more attention to detail and put the lady into a greater prospective, perhaps a prequel to the main part of the story (the recent Johnny Depp movie 'Dark shadows" a case in point) showing the lady in her tribal land and how she met the Doctor before arriving to England. The explanation in the movie is all too bland and passed over for the most part. The same applied for the ending although there were some explanatory subtitles and compensating visual glimpses of when she was returned to South Africa.\n\nWhat we see in this film is no different from what still goes on in our world today but in a different way. We go-global in order to see the very thing that this humble woman was subjected to and we pay to see it, sometimes on the internet - animals as well as humans - and it is only perhaps in western countries that there are anti-voice against the abuse in circuses.\n\nWe should watch this film and want to be shocked. Unlike the spectators shown throughout the film, we have the benefit of a greater education and enhanced knowledge but abuse such as Saartje Baartman is shown to endure in the movie, goes on to this day.\n\nThere was a lack of cohesion at times in the transition from going London to Paris and then later when Saartje found herself in the Brothels. Yes, she drank and smoked and was inevitably sensitive and temperamental given her real life role play but this is indeed an extraordinary film about an extraordinary woman who is extraordinary for her courage and determination and not so unordinary from any other woman except for her buttocks and her labia, according to the medical scientists.\n\nI certainly enjoyed this film more than the "Hobbit' which bored the pants off me (except for the special effects) and yes 'Venus Noire' is slow and often repetitive but I can share empathy with the Director and in an unkind, cruel, uncomfortable way, this is entertainment.\n\nOn a general note, there is no swearing or offensive violence, despite the harsh treatment Saartje Baartman endured while away from South Africa. Yes, she is mostly naked for large sections of the film and there are a couple of later scenes in Paris where she is in a sexual situation but apart from that, this is not a film for a sexual voyeur and don't expect to see flashes of an unusually large labia because you will not.\n\nThe standard of acting in this film is excellent. I may be wrong here but this is a French film and so good sub-titles in English or language of your choice are important. I suggest that there are a lot of other movies out there who will shock and offend you a whole lot more than this one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2010-10-27","keywords":"brothel,nudity,racism,exhibition,female nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135788313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MzZhZjUtNmU4MC00NjcxLWI1NDktYTRjNDY1NmVlMDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MzZhZjUtNmU4MC00NjcxLWI1NDktYTRjNDY1NmVlMDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4070086/","name":"Yahima Torres","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414325/","name":"Andre Jacobs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332709/","name":"Olivier Gourmet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444244/","name":"Abdellatif Kechiche"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028908/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444244/","name":"Abdellatif Kechiche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480308/","name":"Ghalya Lacroix"],"duration":"PT2H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a crime show about characters (not as good as "The Closer" -- the crime show I adored this summer -- mind you), and I enjoyed it. At times, it seemed far-fetched, and the whole Senator plot-point in the pilot seemed awful easy, but the dialogue worked, the characters intrigue me, and the chemistry is great.

It's not bad!","reviewBody":"It's not the greatest medical drama and does not compare to ER as far as realism goes but as a nurse most of the medical stuff is correct and every show gets stuff wrong so don't not like a medical show because it's not 100% accurate. \n\nI like that they have taken this show on from a different angle - money and corruption! I don't live in the USA but I imagine this is actually quite accurate in the way hospitals are run and that it is all about money and not necessarily doing what's best for the patient. \n\nThe characters so far are interesting - I'm 7 episodes in and I like that some patients are in it for longer than an episode. There are characters you want to root for the do gooders and there are characters you love to hate who are selfish, rich and really in the wrong business. Oh and there's a main character that's a nurse which is always a plus since we basically make the hospitals run! \n\nSo if you like medical dramas give it a go! I've seen them all - ER is the best, I've got a soft spot for Greys Anatomy even though sometimes it's ridiculous m, Code Black is great, Chicago Med is alright, The night shift was good.

But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions.

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).\n\nNow the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&amp;Ms.\n\nEmma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face ("now act SURPRISED" - "now show us a sense of WONDER" - "now look SAD"). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they spend the 200 million budget on?\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity for Disney.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Fantasy","Musical"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down.

I can't praise this one enough.\n\nChristopher Plummer is superb, in what is (perhaps coincidentally) an ironic bit of casting. Jodie Foster rises to a challenging persona with aplomb and ease, and my only complaint of the entire exercise is that her character's name 'Madeline White' is perhaps a little cliché. Beyond that, there isn't a filmmaker alive who brings New York to the screen with anything approximating Spike Lee's vision.\n\nIt seems there hasn't been a lot of junket for this one, and that Spike Lee's presence has been downplayed... as if the studio downplayed the fact that this is a Spike Lee film slightly, until the word was out that this film is over and beyond what an audience might already expect from one of his films.\n\nSo... let me just say.. man o man this is a cinematic mind-blowing amazing one and a half hours... it's brilliant, tight, funny, articulate, intense, and high time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":353578,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).\n\nNow the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible?

Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened?

There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my "seeing as many 2018 films as possible" quest.\n\nThis is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We're supposed to "care" about these characters when in fact we don't. They're not bad actors, actually, some surprised me, but at the end of the day, we just want to see some flying limbs.

And of course cue the blood card. It's laid out all on here. Well at least the tree rape was a solid homage, but I still prefer the original's.\n\nAll in all, "Evil Dead" can't be described as "awful", "insulting", or a bad remake. It can be described as "not scary", "average", or really both of those things.

They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well.

And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\n\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\n\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like.

The performances of Kline and Judd were magnificent. The use of Porter's songs was astonishing. The sets and costumes sublime. However, it was the way that the director swept you along and hurled you into the final sequence with Porter saying goodbye to Linda and going to meet his maker that will linger in my mind forever.

This film may not be historically accurate, some of the vocal performances may have done the songs less than justice, but this was a great, great movie. The performances of Kline and Judd were magnificent. The use of Porter's songs was astonishing. The sets and costumes sublime. However, it was the way that the director swept you along and hurled you into the final sequence with Porter saying goodbye to Linda and going to meet his maker that will linger in my mind forever. With the possible exception of Moulin Rouge, the only musical film of the last 40 years that could live up to those of the classic era.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11160,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Niezwyciezona: Directed by Tom Kolinski. With Joanna Jedrzejczyk, Kami Barzini, Mike Brown, Chris Cornell. A dynamic and emotional story of fighting, passion and sacrifice. From 2016 to 2018, the filmmakers accompanied Joanna Jedrzejczyk, a multiple UFC champion, who at her time conquered the world of female MMA. To stay on top, the Polish fighter has to constantly confront her opponents and her own body, which is forced to make superhuman efforts over and over again.

You should see it. Its all about the writing, though.\n\nMcCarthy's writing style comes after the Clancy/Ludlum model where things are diced into parallel episodes but unified in a grand arc driven by the cosmic principle that good triumphs and the bad guys get punished. This has become the cinematic norm, so whenever we pass through a scene-story, we know how it fits in a universe powered by a machine of justice.\n\nMcCarthy has the intelligence to open the world, introducing into his novels the notion of apparently unraveled justice. We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.\n\nBut its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.\n\nThe other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That "viewing" piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice. \n\nIts all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.\n\nSo why am I unhappy?\n\nBecause the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.\n\nHere, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled. \n\nYes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for? PT Andersen? Sean Penn? When the Coens simply rely on their competence, they steal from us the things that they uniquely can do: confabulate and confuse reality.

All the talent that has been brought to this project has been first rate. The writing is excellent. All the actors down to the very minor ones nail their characters and deliver superb believable performances. The cinematography, sound and other technical elements are 'invisible,' which means that those aspects of the film have been done flawlessly.\n\nThe movie is very funny with many laughs. The comedy emerges from the situations as everyone in the film plays it straight as if it were a drama.\n\nIt takes a very skilled director to pull off this type of story successfully.

If you watch this expecting a movie full of action and suspense you will be disappointed.\n\nHere's what's good about this film. All the talent that has been brought to this project has been first rate. The writing is excellent. All the actors down to the very minor ones nail their characters and deliver superb believable performances. The cinematography, sound and other technical elements are 'invisible,' which means that those aspects of the film have been done flawlessly.\n\nThe movie is very funny with many laughs. The comedy emerges from the situations as everyone in the film plays it straight as if it were a drama.\n\nIt takes a very skilled director to pull off this type of story successfully. Minor flaws can make it not work. This film works.\n\nI think if you drop your fast paced thriller expectations for this film you will find it extremely enjoyable.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-07-13","keywords":"untrustworthiness,watching tv,friend,contemplating suicide,crying","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You Kill Me","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi249757977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc2OTkwNGItYzIxMy00YzMwLTlkYzEtYTMwYTc3MGY3YTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc2OTkwNGItYzIxMy00YzMwLTlkYzEtYTMwYTc3MGY3YTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from IFC","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005561/","name":"Luke Wilson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001093/","name":"John Dahl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143069/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208303/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1321655/","name":"Christopher Markus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1321656/","name":"Stephen McFeely"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

On the surface, it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film, casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take, opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichés, including rooftop billowing fog, high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness, and larger than life acrobatic feats ("always check the garbage days" moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall). Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons (including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages) could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted, enjoyable cinematic fun. \n\nBut Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody, which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer, Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing, settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crime/mystery thriller and poignant character study, as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability, and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground, Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity, utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. \n\nOf course, being the work of a first time director, one would expect the occasional fumble, and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax, meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless, an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism (clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources) which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional, adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley, managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift, whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest, either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. \n\nThe casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius, as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film, beautifully blending child-like emotional simplicity, tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true, as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor, warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker, yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichés with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop, and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally, Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner, infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour, and bringing welcome life to the film.\n\nIt would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist: slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times, yet cleverly self-aware, comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness, and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic, cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody, straight out superhero film or character study (or ultimately all three), Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success, and one easily worth a watch.\n\n-7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-13","keywords":"vigilante,superhero,gun running,organized crime,pimp","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Defendor: U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi554959897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around three characters: an everyday guy who comes to believe he's a superhero, his psychiatrist, and the teenager he befriends."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993507/","name":"Kat Dennings"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0644897/","name":"Sandra Oh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005584/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Suffering from inner demons he retreats to the wilderness (the farm) and experiences an epiphany through the physical manifestation of his creators, going back and finally confronting and conquering the demons. (Dirty D = Dirty Devil)Along the way he even awakens the dead (the knife wielder at the club), banishes a horde of false prophets (all the fake Pooties), and can bring people to rapture through sheer silence alone.

    <desc lang="pl">The Internship: Directed by Shawn Levy. With Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rose Byrne, Aasif Mandvi.

This time I'm coming at you with the Internship, the latest comedy starring that dynamic duo Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who entertained us with Wedding Crashers. Well it seems eight years later the team who helped make that fun comedy have returned to make what many are calling a remake/ knock off of the "romantic" comedy. Is it true, or is there more to this movie than meets the eye? Please read on to hear my opinions. \n\nI'll agree that there are many similarities to the plot of Wedding Crashers. The two smooth talkers seem to be living the dream, until something happens to derail their train and send them on a new path that is for the better. Instead of banging babes and finding true love though, this time it's more about taking a chance and bridging a gap between generations all the while addressing the trials within. This is where one of my strengths of this movie comes in, the relevance of the plot to me. The Internship addresses big problems that faces many today, the security and safety of a job and the challenge that our culture has become. Being a student currently going through similar trials, I found the production team did a good job showing the various struggles that the younger generation faces, and their accompanying Impressing parents, cynical approaches to problems, the substitution of technology for life, and many more issues are all well integrated into this movie to drive the point across. Lucky for the audience it's not done in too cheesy a manner that it makes you think it's an 80's/90's sitcom. Something else I liked was the fact that all of the characters in their intern group had a problem, which allowed for yes you guessed it BALANCE, which we all know I like. Of course it's not just solely a bunch of smart college kids pulling miracles out of the air, and complaining about their problems. No Vaughn and Wilson's characters have their own problems that they had to face as they get integrated into a new world that the younger generation seems to run. Now we've seen these problems before I won't lie, but there is some fresh chemistry between the older generation and newer generation that shows off a dual teacher-student relationship. \n\nWith limited space let's move on to the comedy. The Internship switches gears from odd/awkward sex scenarios that floods the dialog and bounces into the land of stereotypical nerds, generation gaps, and new experiences that go a different route. For me this allowed for some balance in humor, with many of the "inspirational" speeches and geek events making me laugh at points through the movie. Character references from star wars, insults using computer vernacular, and dressing up as literature with some pizazz await those who go to this movie, so be ready for this humor. I like the diversity, and some of the creativity these guys did, but from the responses of the other audience members that wasn't the same case. Don't worry though they still laughed, but more so on the sexual situations that still appear a good number of times. As for the older generation, the team also digs up some references from the previous decades, which although were sometimes over my head, still entertained the audience and me at points. However, this could have been due to the delivery of the lines and acting that went with it.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, the acting. Like Wedding Crashers Vaughn and Wilson are the same duo that entertained us years ago, delivering their lines in the same manner as they did back then. Vaughn delivers his lines at a rapid pace in a jumbled, hyper mess that has random words flying through the air. Wilson joins him in the stamped of words, but then brought sarcasm to the table to retaliate some of the quips thrown at him. Not one to be backed down, Vaughn would come right back with his spin on sarcastic dialog and usually throw in his natural, goofy face that brought the finishing punch to the humor. However, this is what these guys almost always do in their comedies, which means that if you are tired of this chemistry then you probably don't want to see this movie, because you might get annoyed with the brotherhood these two share. Yet there are other props due to some of the other cast members. The lovely Rose Byrne is a combination of beauty and good acting as she adds an Australian accent into mix and plays more of the love story part, yet her character is a step down from her previous parts. Josh Brener, the phone commercial guy, had a fun character as well, being the classic and hopeful nerd with a goal that seems impossible. As for the "bad" guy of this movie, Max Minghella did a nice job adding some British edge to the villain, but for the most part it was the same character with more bite and computer skills, than political bark. The rest of the group is fine, each doing a good job at the role they are playing and looking the part in every scene. \n\nThe Internship is a fun summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. While it is definitely not the most original movie, there are plenty of jokes to keep you laughing and having fun, no matter what generation you are from. However, there are a lot of similarities, primarily the acting, that this movie has and I will say is a somewhat knock off of Wedding Crashers. If you are looking for a fun group movie or just some mindless fun, well consider this film; otherwise wait for Redbox for this film.

Well it seems eight years later the team who helped make that fun comedy have returned to make what many are calling a remake/ knock off of the "romantic" comedy. Is it true, or is there more to this movie than meets the eye? Please read on to hear my opinions. \n\nI'll agree that there are many similarities to the plot of Wedding Crashers. The two smooth talkers seem to be living the dream, until something happens to derail their train and send them on a new path that is for the better. Instead of banging babes and finding true love though, this time it's more about taking a chance and bridging a gap between generations all the while addressing the trials within. This is where one of my strengths of this movie comes in, the relevance of the plot to me. The Internship addresses big problems that faces many today, the security and safety of a job and the challenge that our culture has become. Being a student currently going through similar trials, I found the production team did a good job showing the various struggles that the younger generation faces, and their accompanying Impressing parents, cynical approaches to problems, the substitution of technology for life, and many more issues are all well integrated into this movie to drive the point across. Lucky for the audience it's not done in too cheesy a manner that it makes you think it's an 80's/90's sitcom. Something else I liked was the fact that all of the characters in their intern group had a problem, which allowed for yes you guessed it BALANCE, which we all know I like. Of course it's not just solely a bunch of smart college kids pulling miracles out of the air, and complaining about their problems. No Vaughn and Wilson's characters have their own problems that they had to face as they get integrated into a new world that the younger generation seems to run. Now we've seen these problems before I won't lie, but there is some fresh chemistry between the older generation and newer generation that shows off a dual teacher-student relationship. \n\nWith limited space let's move on to the comedy. The Internship switches gears from odd/awkward sex scenarios that floods the dialog and bounces into the land of stereotypical nerds, generation gaps, and new experiences that go a different route. For me this allowed for some balance in humor, with many of the "inspirational" speeches and geek events making me laugh at points through the movie. Character references from star wars, insults using computer vernacular, and dressing up as literature with some pizazz await those who go to this movie, so be ready for this humor. I like the diversity, and some of the creativity these guys did, but from the responses of the other audience members that wasn't the same case. Don't worry though they still laughed, but more so on the sexual situations that still appear a good number of times. As for the older generation, the team also digs up some references from the previous decades, which although were sometimes over my head, still entertained the audience and me at points. However, this could have been due to the delivery of the lines and acting that went with it.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, the acting. Like Wedding Crashers Vaughn and Wilson are the same duo that entertained us years ago, delivering their lines in the same manner as they did back then. Vaughn delivers his lines at a rapid pace in a jumbled, hyper mess that has random words flying through the air. Wilson joins him in the stamped of words, but then brought sarcasm to the table to retaliate some of the quips thrown at him. Not one to be backed down, Vaughn would come right back with his spin on sarcastic dialog and usually throw in his natural, goofy face that brought the finishing punch to the humor. However, this is what these guys almost always do in their comedies, which means that if you are tired of this chemistry then you probably don't want to see this movie, because you might get annoyed with the brotherhood these two share. Yet there are other props due to some of the other cast members. The lovely Rose Byrne is a combination of beauty and good acting as she adds an Australian accent into mix and plays more of the love story part, yet her character is a step down from her previous parts. Josh Brener, the phone commercial guy, had a fun character as well, being the classic and hopeful nerd with a goal that seems impossible. As for the "bad" guy of this movie, Max Minghella did a nice job adding some British edge to the villain, but for the most part it was the same character with more bite and computer skills, than political bark. The rest of the group is fine, each doing a good job at the role they are playing and looking the part in every scene. \n\nThe Internship is a fun summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. While it is definitely not the most original movie, there are plenty of jokes to keep you laughing and having fun, no matter what generation you are from. However, there are a lot of similarities, primarily the acting, that this movie has and I will say is a somewhat knock off of Wedding Crashers. If you are looking for a fun group movie or just some mindless fun, well consider this film; otherwise wait for Redbox for this film.

I do not think it was as good as the first but still, very good. This movie was full of awesome action sequences. Some would say implausible but what action movie is realistic? I also kind of got the vibe that the producers of this movie were a bit mad at Vin Diesel but all that could be just part of the storyline, which I like. I guess the XXX will always be someone new, even more the opposite of James Bond.\n\nAugustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) seems to be the main recurring character. We learn a little bit about his past, his scarred face in particular. He chooses an old military acquaintance named Darius Stone (Ice Cube) as the new, badder and meaner XXX. This time, they have to stop an evil Secretary of Defense, Gen. George Octavius Deckert (Willem Dafoe) from having all those in the chain of command above him assassinated.

I guess the XXX will always be someone new, even more the opposite of James Bond.\n\nAugustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) seems to be the main recurring character. We learn a little bit about his past, his scarred face in particular. He chooses an old military acquaintance named Darius Stone (Ice Cube) as the new, badder and meaner XXX. This time, they have to stop an evil Secretary of Defense, Gen. George Octavius Deckert (Willem Dafoe) from having all those in the chain of command above him assassinated.

This time I'm coming at you with the Internship, the latest comedy starring that dynamic duo Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who entertained us with Wedding Crashers. Well it seems eight years later the team who helped make that fun comedy have returned to make what many are calling a remake/ knock off of the "romantic" comedy. Is it true, or is there more to this movie than meets the eye? Please read on to hear my opinions. \n\nI'll agree that there are many similarities to the plot of Wedding Crashers. The two smooth talkers seem to be living the dream, until something happens to derail their train and send them on a new path that is for the better. Instead of banging babes and finding true love though, this time it's more about taking a chance and bridging a gap between generations all the while addressing the trials within. This is where one of my strengths of this movie comes in, the relevance of the plot to me. The Internship addresses big problems that faces many today, the security and safety of a job and the challenge that our culture has become. Being a student currently going through similar trials, I found the production team did a good job showing the various struggles that the younger generation faces, and their accompanying Impressing parents, cynical approaches to problems, the substitution of technology for life, and many more issues are all well integrated into this movie to drive the point across. Lucky for the audience it's not done in too cheesy a manner that it makes you think it's an 80's/90's sitcom. Something else I liked was the fact that all of the characters in their intern group had a problem, which allowed for yes you guessed it BALANCE, which we all know I like. Of course it's not just solely a bunch of smart college kids pulling miracles out of the air, and complaining about their problems. No Vaughn and Wilson's characters have their own problems that they had to face as they get integrated into a new world that the younger generation seems to run. Now we've seen these problems before I won't lie, but there is some fresh chemistry between the older generation and newer generation that shows off a dual teacher-student relationship. \n\nWith limited space let's move on to the comedy. The Internship switches gears from odd/awkward sex scenarios that floods the dialog and bounces into the land of stereotypical nerds, generation gaps, and new experiences that go a different route. For me this allowed for some balance in humor, with many of the "inspirational" speeches and geek events making me laugh at points through the movie. Character references from star wars, insults using computer vernacular, and dressing up as literature with some pizazz await those who go to this movie, so be ready for this humor. I like the diversity, and some of the creativity these guys did, but from the responses of the other audience members that wasn't the same case. Don't worry though they still laughed, but more so on the sexual situations that still appear a good number of times. As for the older generation, the team also digs up some references from the previous decades, which although were sometimes over my head, still entertained the audience and me at points. However, this could have been due to the delivery of the lines and acting that went with it.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, the acting. Like Wedding Crashers Vaughn and Wilson are the same duo that entertained us years ago, delivering their lines in the same manner as they did back then. Vaughn delivers his lines at a rapid pace in a jumbled, hyper mess that has random words flying through the air. Wilson joins him in the stamped of words, but then brought sarcasm to the table to retaliate some of the quips thrown at him. Not one to be backed down, Vaughn would come right back with his spin on sarcastic dialog and usually throw in his natural, goofy face that brought the finishing punch to the humor. However, this is what these guys almost always do in their comedies, which means that if you are tired of this chemistry then you probably don't want to see this movie, because you might get annoyed with the brotherhood these two share. Yet there are other props due to some of the other cast members. The lovely Rose Byrne is a combination of beauty and good acting as she adds an Australian accent into mix and plays more of the love story part, yet her character is a step down from her previous parts. Josh Brener, the phone commercial guy, had a fun character as well, being the classic and hopeful nerd with a goal that seems impossible. As for the "bad" guy of this movie, Max Minghella did a nice job adding some British edge to the villain, but for the most part it was the same character with more bite and computer skills, than political bark. The rest of the group is fine, each doing a good job at the role they are playing and looking the part in every scene. \n\nThe Internship is a fun summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. While it is definitely not the most original movie, there are plenty of jokes to keep you laughing and having fun, no matter what generation you are from. However, there are a lot of similarities, primarily the acting, that this movie has and I will say is a somewhat knock off of Wedding Crashers. If you are looking for a fun group movie or just some mindless fun, well consider this film; otherwise wait for Redbox for this film.

Just because David Ayer who wrote The Training Day directed this movie, expectation was very high from the beginning. Please do not built high expectation or compare to Training Day because it is unfair to the Street Kings. Yes, this movie is not as good as the Training Day, but does it mean this is a bad movie to see? I say "NO". Keanu Reeves was taking a lot of blames(from his early years Dude....but DUDE, that was like 20 plus years ago!!! Give him a break!!!) In my eyes, keanu Reeves was very believable.

Just because David Ayer who wrote The Training Day directed this movie, expectation was very high from the beginning. Please do not built high expectation or compare to Training Day because it is unfair to the Street Kings. Yes, this movie is not as good as the Training Day, but does it mean this is a bad movie to see? I say "NO". Keanu Reeves was taking a lot of blames(from his early years Dude....but DUDE, that was like 20 plus years ago!!! Give him a break!!!) In my eyes, keanu Reeves was very believable. His good looks makes his alcoholic, out of control, bad cop believable as he is invisible/untouchable. Oscar winner, Forest Whitaker seems over acting through the movie. Chris Evans was great additional character to spice up the movie.

"The Naked Gun" is without a doubt the best skewering of all cop movie cliches available in this day and age.  It works on every conceivable level and a few that haven't been conceived yet.\n\nBut what puts it over the top is Leslie Nielsen.\n\nIt's amazing: he was great in "Airplane!", another classic from the ZAZ team (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), and in the lamentably short TV series "Police Squad!".  But here, he spreads his wings and flies to new heights of insanity and delerium.  With jaw set square and tongue firmly in cheek, Neilsen makes the role of Lt. Frank Drebin all his own and the movie-going public's collective life is all the more enriched because of it.\n\nHe's aided and abetted by greats like Kennedy, Presley and Montalban (who knew?) and the movie even finds good moments for John Houseman and Reggie Jackson.  \n\nAs I said, the movie takes off and finds great things to do with police cars with a mind all their own and goes on from there to take on such cliches as car chases, illegal searches, the cleaning out of the desk, the trip to the police lab, shoot-outs, the lax housework of a single police detective, etc., etc., etc.....\n\nAnd what other cop movie in the history of the world has a music video in the middle, courtesy of Herman's Hermits?\n\nJust one.\n\nTen stars and a Dugout Dog for "The Naked Gun", the film that answers once and for all - can Leslie Nielsen do comedy?\n\nI think you know the answer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":160159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1988-12-02","keywords":"police detective,spoof,slapstick comedy,parody,assassin","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Naked Gun","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3084976409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNDZhYTAtM2EzNy00OGVlLTgxM2YtOWRhMmY5OTA4MGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNDZhYTAtM2EzNy00OGVlLTgxM2YtOWRhMmY5OTA4MGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000558/","name":"Leslie Nielsen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001636/","name":"Priscilla Presley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001740/","name":"O.J.

So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.\n\nDerek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-02-27","keywords":"male model,fashion model,conspiracy,fashion,malaysia","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852132/","name":"Christine Taylor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045189/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766153/","name":"Drake Sather"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357453/","name":"John Hamburg"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No way does this deserve it's 7+ IMDb rating","reviewBody":"Poor acting, really bad story. Boring... it's taken them 5 episodes to get exactly nowhere with the plot so far. Also.. the characters in this show are Stupid... and I do mean stupid with a capital S... characters. Seriously... Nobody is this clueless. \n\nThe entire theory of the show seems to be that the bad guys are bad guys because everyone on the planet is so dumb that they haven't noticed the idiotic stunts they've pulled. The show also seems bent on portraying the kids as mentally challenged too. Sure one of them has some tech savvy but, seriously... some of the 'mistakes' they made are 3rd grader nonsense, not high school. \n\nNot believable at all. And I'm pretty forgiving of most marvel titles. I've liked a lot of them just fine. This one is just... awful.\n\nNot sure how the critics are rating this so high. It's absolutely NOT that great a show... it's not even that good a show... it's borderline awful. \n\nWatch it if you have some time to kill and nothing else decent is on... that's about the only advice I can give.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23815,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-11-21","keywords":"shared universe,superheroine,teenager,super villain,marvel cinematic universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7968341/","name":"Rhenzy Feliz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4555391/","name":"Lyrica Okano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4722966/","name":"Virginia Gardner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0213225/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0218858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335634/","name":"Stephanie Savage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0777300/","name":"Josh Schwartz"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3938893593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk4NDA0OGMtNGI2Yi00OWQyLWEzYjMtZmJiOWNkZDViNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk4NDA0OGMtNGI2Yi00OWQyLWEzYjMtZmJiOWNkZDViNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Season 3, the Runaways frantically search for their captured friends Chase, Gert, and Karolina.

Most of the time though, their output is rarely above mediocre and even often terrible, the worst without any redeeming qualities. Yet there is something compulsive about their relatively consistent badness, speaking as somebody who does not actually mind low-budget and can get enjoyment out of this kind of story, as long as some kind of effort is obvious.\n\n'Monster Island', starting off on a kind note or at least an attempt an honest attempt of a kind note if it doesn't come over that year, is not one of The Asylum's worst. Nowhere near, although there is hardly anything good in 'Monster Island' to me (did have to look hard for them too) it isn't completely irredeemable like their worst efforts are. This is from personal perspective of course. Still found it monstrously bad, the flaws are many, almost every other way, and they are not small, huge actually. Saying this with regret not malice, and there is much more to the problem than being derivative.\n\nIts least bad asset is the production design, the one asset where effort was obvious. Though this is only marginally so rather than significantly so. A particularly good job was done with the caves as has been said already. Some of the photography was okay.\n\nElsewhere, the production values were really poorly done and that the film was made on the cheap is obvious. It looks pretty drab, but it's the disorganised looking editing and last minute looking visual effects, that would even look out of date in the 50s, that come off worst. The submarine is used poorly and there is nothing authentic about it, it didn't look like a submarine and looked like it was filmed in a tank. What can be remembered of the music has very little presence and the film might as better well not had music at all because it didn't fit, added nothing and wouldn't have sounded appealing on its own.\n\nWas expecting little from the script, and it turned out to be worse than expected with the cheese and awkwardness too frequently being rather hard to take. Predictability was hardly unexpected and would have tolerated it, providing that there was some degree of fun and suspense. Unfortunately, 'Monster Island' completely failed to be fun, even on a guilty pleasure level, and the stupidity became intelligence-insulting and exhausting after a while. The suspense was also absent and the whole film felt dreary. The monster action is limited, or at least what the underused creatures are given to do. What there was leaves one confused, bored and shouting at the screen in frustration and the creatures have little personality let alone menace or soul.\n\nGot the sense that the director Mark Atkins had little plan of how to direct or structure 'Monster Island' or what to do with it or that his heart was barely in it. The characters were neither interesting or worth rooting for, there is so little to them in personality or development, their nonsensical decision making is both frustrating and disreacting and how they're written has been seen before many times. The acting is poor at best, the biggest name being Eric Roberts who acts like a sleepwalking robot.\n\nConcluding, very bad. 2/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":582,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-06-01","keywords":"sea monster,helicopter,submarine,psychotronic film,underwater scene","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3779051289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000616/","name":"Eric Roberts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865084/","name":"Toshi Toda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345685/","name":"Adrian Bouchet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it. But of course it came too late and now the show has been cancelled after it just started to find its footing.\n\nContrary to some other comments I've seen, Enterprise did NOT use its cast to its fullest potential. Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something. Reed was just starting to get some good stuff this season.

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16201,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something. Reed was just starting to get some good stuff this season. Enterprise had a wonderful opportunity to connect every Trek series together and revitalize the franchise but all it did (and most people believe this) was bury it. Despite Enterprise's accomplishments, its failures reign supreme. As much as I love Trek, it needs a rest. Maybe after a few years it will be brought back by people who have new ideas to bring to it.

Entire generations of young Polish boys have been raised on it (including myself), often playing under the tables pretending that it's the ''Rudy'' tank. The Communist propaganda didn't matter and was actually quite weak. In fact, the series felt more pro-Russian (and pro-Georgian) than pro-Communist. And it even contained a few thinly-veiled hints of Stalinist crimes: after all, when we first meet Janek, he lives in the middle of the Siberian taiga forest. It doesn't take a genius to figure out how he got there - he was certainly deported along with 1 or 2 millions other Poles in 1939-1941. There are also various characters in the series who refer to various nasty gossips about the Soviet Red Army - an oblique way of acknowledging that the Soviet ''liberation'' of Poland wasn't perceived as such by many (if not most) Poles.\n\nThe series is divided into 21 episodes of 1 hour each. In the first 8 episodes, we follow Janek, Gustlik, Grigorij and their boss Olgierd from Oka (in 1943) to Gdansk (in March 1945). The war is almost over, Olgierd dies, but then the series is resurrected for 13 more episodes that last barely a month (from March to May 1945). Tomek Czeresniak joins the crew that fights German saboteurs on the Pomeranian seacoast and then joins the big offensive across the Odra river all the way to Berlin. Generally speaking, the later episodes are slightly better than the earlier ones - the action scenes are more exciting, and Wieslaw Golas (playing Tomek) is way more fun than Roman Wilhelmi (who plays Olgierd). Particularly exciting is the episode when the tank crew is taken prisoner by the Germans near the Odra river, and the ''Rudy'' tank is used as target practice on an artillery range. The episode when the tank enters the flooded subway tunnels in Berlin is also very impressive.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1405,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"G","genre":["War","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1966-05-09","keywords":"tank,polish army,t 34 tank,german shepherd,soldier","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301515/","name":"Janusz Gajos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0669813/","name":"Franciszek Pieczka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696243/","name":"Wlodzimierz Press"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098526/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041720/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
