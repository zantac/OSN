Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation.

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something.\n\nThe Movie, surprisingly, has more plot than you would think. M. Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world, such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards, creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me, it is as silly as it sounds.\n\nLt. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice, once and for all, thus stopping his plans for world domination.\n\nFrom there on in, the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician, respectively. Chun-Li, Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat.\n\nLike I said, the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service, since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside, Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau ("The Room") when you close your eyes, and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring.\n\nWell, why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons, two are part of the movie, and one is a personal thing.\n\n1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over, there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top, but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie, and as a result, he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything, he gives us a theatrical villain which, for his character, works very well.\n\n2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest, writing a movie is easy, but writing a good movie is hard. The director (Who is also the writer) took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it, and a fairly well done one at that. Sure, not in execution, but in originality, it works.\n\n3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's, and as such, I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age, and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor, but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes, and how cool M. Bison was to me (in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool).\n\nThis movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good, but understand from my point of view, even knowing how bad it is, having no character development, some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances, including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight, I still like it.\n\nIt's cheesy, terrible and ridiculous, but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come, and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is, "This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely, you've heard of it." In other words, go see this movie if you haven't already.\n\n7/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69655,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1994-12-23","keywords":"campy,guile character,m. bison character,fight,rescue","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Street Fighter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi921305369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzliYzAyNmUtOGI3MC00YjJlLWJmZjYtNDU5MmRiMmQ3MWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzliYzAyNmUtOGI3MC00YjJlLWJmZjYtNDU5MmRiMmQ3MWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000471/","name":"Raul Julia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001840/","name":"Ming-Na Wen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040904/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0680251/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And, in the end, you will think it was worth every minute spent watching.\n\nAs you can tell, I really liked this movie a lot.\n\nMy only complaint was Robs smoking... ;-)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142685,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-03-31","keywords":"new york,new york city,binge drinking,september 11 2001,year 1991","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1472839961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlMTgxMGMtZWE5NC00NjA1LWEzNTgtMmVhZGZjNTY0MzNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlMTgxMGMtZWE5NC00NjA1LWEzNTgtMmVhZGZjNTY0MzNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211087/","name":"Emilie de Ravin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3533310/","name":"Caitlyn Rund"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002339/","name":"Allen Coulter"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yes, seven. No, I'm not talking about the David Fincher directed thriller, nor am I referring to Samurai, Dwarfs or the lucky number. In this context, seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.\n\nParticular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts, the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision, studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory "shocker" ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly, director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline, but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes, a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh, as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably, but chiefly, my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loud-mouthed anti-hero category (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Snakes on a Plane), and on the other, his more nuanced (as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be) roles. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-19","keywords":"interracial couple,neighbor,suburb,double standard,suburbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lakeview Terrace: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3043295257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Samuel L.

The movie was originally meant to be screened last month, with an appearance by co-star Joe Pantoliano. Joey Pants did come (his daughter is a student here), but technical difficulties plagued the screening twenty minutes in. Joe was very apologetic and stayed to answer questions for a while and in the meantime they set up another screening for tonight. No Joe tonight (he's apparently filming a new pilot for CBS about waterfront crime), but the movie did work so I can tell you what it's all about.\n\nJeff Bridges stars as a recent divorcée who is down on his luck in a small town. Looking for a way to make it big and have the means to spoil his son, he decides to make a porn movie. He does this with the help of his supportive friends, including Pantoliano, Ted Danson, William Fichtner, Tim Blake Nelson and Patrick Fugit. Their film will be distinctive because it will be made by and feature talent from their own small town. Now I know this entire plot sounds kind of corny but it is well executed  everyone laughed pretty hard throughout.\n\nBesides having a great cast, what makes this movie different is that it is a sex comedy for and by adults. This may be a tough sell, but I can say that at least half of tonight's audience was definitely professors and community members, rather than students. Though there is little nudity or hard language, this is an R-movie because of its frank discussion of sex. It's funny because these guys are trying to be respectful by replacing words for genitalia with other appropriate, but ridiculous terms.\n\nAs I mentioned, the cast was great and everyone was prefect for their role. Pantoliano plays the appropriately named writer-director of the production, Some Idiot. Danson plays a gay friend who tries too hard at hiding his sexual orientation, making for some very funny and awkward moments. Fichtner does a really good job with making a fairly plain character entertaining and fun to watch. Bridges plays a loser in the vein of "The Dude", except he's got it together a little more and is a little cleaner cut. About half of Bridges performance is voice-over as well, which was done fairly well. My biggest complaint would be that their female characters receive very little screen time and are underdeveloped. The cut we saw really underused Lauren Graham and Judy Greer.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Michael Traeger, whose most notable previous credit was writing the script of MTV's Dead Man on Campus (ouch). The script was really funny and the direction was suitable, though not very special. Based on what Joe said at the first screening, it sounds like they will only be changing the opening of the film  so the cut I saw was pretty close to finished. I believe it will be hitting theaters late spring/early summer. All in all it was an entertaining little indie comedy and its worth checking out for a good laugh.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6320,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-04-28","keywords":"small town,loser,adult filmmaking,pornographic film,hot","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Amateurs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2207580441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJkZDkwNzktZDNiMS00NzFhLThhYTktM2FhZDg5ODQ2ZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJkZDkwNzktZDNiMS00NzFhLThhYTktM2FhZDg5ODQ2ZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Amateurs"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001101/","name":"Ted Danson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001592/","name":"Joe Pantoliano"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870592/","name":"Michael Traeger"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010508/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870592/","name":"Michael Traeger"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something.\n\nThe Movie, surprisingly, has more plot than you would think. M. Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world, such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards, creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me, it is as silly as it sounds.\n\nLt. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice, once and for all, thus stopping his plans for world domination.\n\nFrom there on in, the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician, respectively. Chun-Li, Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat.\n\nLike I said, the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service, since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside, Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau ("The Room") when you close your eyes, and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring.\n\nWell, why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons, two are part of the movie, and one is a personal thing.\n\n1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over, there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top, but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie, and as a result, he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything, he gives us a theatrical villain which, for his character, works very well.\n\n2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest, writing a movie is easy, but writing a good movie is hard. The director (Who is also the writer) took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it, and a fairly well done one at that. Sure, not in execution, but in originality, it works.\n\n3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's, and as such, I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age, and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor, but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes, and how cool M. Bison was to me (in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool).\n\nThis movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good, but understand from my point of view, even knowing how bad it is, having no character development, some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances, including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight, I still like it.\n\nIt's cheesy, terrible and ridiculous, but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come, and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is, "This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely, you've heard of it." In other words, go see this movie if you haven't already.\n\n7/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69655,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1994-12-23","keywords":"campy,guile character,m. bison character,fight,rescue","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Street Fighter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi921305369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzliYzAyNmUtOGI3MC00YjJlLWJmZjYtNDU5MmRiMmQ3MWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzliYzAyNmUtOGI3MC00YjJlLWJmZjYtNDU5MmRiMmQ3MWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000471/","name":"Raul Julia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001840/","name":"Ming-Na Wen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040904/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0680251/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Since Donnie Brasco, many movies have used this same formula using an undercover agent to partake in organized crime takedowns, but it was really Donnie Brasco that started, or at least rejuvenated, this form of the genre.\n\nThe only reason I can think that it is only a 7.7 on IMDB is probably because this mafia genre has incredibly high expectations for it with the likes of The Godfather(s), Goodfellas, and even Heat. It doesn't pack the punch that those movies have and is more subdued in its delivery, but the pacing is impeccable and there is barely a moment in the entire runtime that is even a momentary letdown, which is rare. Donnie Brasco goes in a different direction than these films, focusing distinctly on the impact the job has on Joe Pistone's marriage, as well as the relationship he unionizes with "Lefty", in a groundbreaking role by Al Pacino, who plays an over-the-hill, stagnated, and somewhat desperate, made mafia member who feels unappreciated and disrespected to a level that deep down inside he wants out of it.\n\nNot only are the performances all solid throughout, particularly from Pacino, Ann Hesche, Michael Madsen, and Depp, but the writing is excellent and the musical score is emotionally stunning. Anyone who is a fan of the genre or classic movies in general will definitely not regret watching Donnie Brasco, a top 25 movie here. It's a 9/10, but I'm giving it a 10/10 since compared with what the average movie is today or in the past twenty years, Donnie Brasco is way above them in heart, originality, execution, and acting talent.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":292163,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-02-28","keywords":"mafia,fbi agent,money,cutting off a leg,racial slur","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Donnie Brasco: Extended Cut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3768189721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY2M2NiY2ItMDNjMC00NDE2LWJkZjYtZTA0ZDEyODBiM2RkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY2M2NiY2ItMDNjMC00NDE2LWJkZjYtZTA0ZDEyODBiM2RkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000514/","name":"Michael Madsen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001565/","name":"Mike Newell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038108/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013696/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0685587/","name":"Joseph D.

It's a 9/10, but I'm giving it a 10/10 since compared with what the average movie is today or in the past twenty years, Donnie Brasco is way above them in heart, originality, execution, and acting talent.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":292163,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-02-28","keywords":"mafia,fbi agent,money,cutting off a leg,racial slur","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Donnie Brasco: Extended Cut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3768189721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY2M2NiY2ItMDNjMC00NDE2LWJkZjYtZTA0ZDEyODBiM2RkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY2M2NiY2ItMDNjMC00NDE2LWJkZjYtZTA0ZDEyODBiM2RkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000514/","name":"Michael Madsen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001565/","name":"Mike Newell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038108/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013696/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0685587/","name":"Joseph D.

It drew me in to its world without me hardly noticing it - a world of ultra-realism, burnished, you must say, by some quite incredible performances from Katie Jarvis and the rest of the cast.\n\nOne night of disturbed sleep after watching it and I am still in their world, out on the bleak and beautiful flatlands bordering Essex and London which so many people speed through every day as they journey between London and mainland Europe on the Eurostar trains. I myself have taken that journey a few times and wondered what the people's lives were like who lived in this strange landscape where London has parked so much of the stuff that it doesn't want to see - the giant container terminals, the power plants and the chemical works.\n\nFish Tank perhaps gives a taste of those lives, but it does much more than that. Especially it gives us a heroine who we can't help caring for deeply, despite and partly because she is on the outside so nasty, rude and violent. Through some of the things she gets up to as she wonders around we see a natural love of life bursting to get out though. We also have an attractive and kind man come into the picture who, through his natural goodness, offers an outlet for her yearnings for understanding, fun, and intimacy.\n\nThe story starts off slowly as we get to know 15-year old Mia, her family and the wider (and very limited) world around her. But it picks up and becomes tautly gripping at times - and it never slips into sentimentality or offers false redemption. It is all the better for that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61035,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-09-11","keywords":"15 year old,older man younger woman relationship,dancing,council estate,sex with a minor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fish Tank","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2257454105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MjIyMTcwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MjIyMTcwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everything changes for 15yr old Mia when her mum brings home a new boyfriend.

It drew me in to its world without me hardly noticing it - a world of ultra-realism, burnished, you must say, by some quite incredible performances from Katie Jarvis and the rest of the cast.\n\nOne night of disturbed sleep after watching it and I am still in their world, out on the bleak and beautiful flatlands bordering Essex and London which so many people speed through every day as they journey between London and mainland Europe on the Eurostar trains. I myself have taken that journey a few times and wondered what the people's lives were like who lived in this strange landscape where London has parked so much of the stuff that it doesn't want to see - the giant container terminals, the power plants and the chemical works.\n\nFish Tank perhaps gives a taste of those lives, but it does much more than that. Especially it gives us a heroine who we can't help caring for deeply, despite and partly because she is on the outside so nasty, rude and violent. Through some of the things she gets up to as she wonders around we see a natural love of life bursting to get out though. We also have an attractive and kind man come into the picture who, through his natural goodness, offers an outlet for her yearnings for understanding, fun, and intimacy.\n\nThe story starts off slowly as we get to know 15-year old Mia, her family and the wider (and very limited) world around her. But it picks up and becomes tautly gripping at times - and it never slips into sentimentality or offers false redemption. It is all the better for that.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61035,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-09-11","keywords":"15 year old,older man younger woman relationship,dancing,council estate,sex with a minor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fish Tank","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2257454105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MjIyMTcwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MjIyMTcwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everything changes for 15yr old Mia when her mum brings home a new boyfriend.

There is a reason it could not procure a wide-release. It is a very difficult film, I felt the trailer represents the film quite well and what to expect. I wasn't able to watch this film until about 4yrs after I watched the trailer the first time, and I loved it so much I immediately watched it again, and seeing it a second time was just as good, especially in light of what you learn the first time you watch the film. This film definitely begs to be watched multiple times.\n\nThis is absolutely not a science fiction film, but a film about confronting your past, and finding the truth, it is definitely a time travel film for women. The script is very well-written, it is beautifully filmed, the acting is superb. I am surprised this was ever made because of it's difficult subject matter revolving around a very troubled women in her early 30's who witnesses an elderly woman jumping out of her apartment building and killing herself, and ends up in a time warp going all the way back to when she was in the womb. To say anymore would ruin the film.\n\nIf you are a fan of well-made movies that explore topics such as rape, incest, suicide, and adultery, without condoning the acts (a true rarity these days), but while somewhat objectively observing them, you will like this film.

There is a reason it could not procure a wide-release. It is a very difficult film, I felt the trailer represents the film quite well and what to expect. I wasn't able to watch this film until about 4yrs after I watched the trailer the first time, and I loved it so much I immediately watched it again, and seeing it a second time was just as good, especially in light of what you learn the first time you watch the film. This film definitely begs to be watched multiple times.\n\nThis is absolutely not a science fiction film, but a film about confronting your past, and finding the truth, it is definitely a time travel film for women. The script is very well-written, it is beautifully filmed, the acting is superb. I am surprised this was ever made because of it's difficult subject matter revolving around a very troubled women in her early 30's who witnesses an elderly woman jumping out of her apartment building and killing herself, and ends up in a time warp going all the way back to when she was in the womb. To say anymore would ruin the film.\n\nIf you are a fan of well-made movies that explore topics such as rape, incest, suicide, and adultery, without condoning the acts (a true rarity these days), but while somewhat objectively observing them, you will like this film. It is a tense at times, and somewhat difficult to watch. There are many mysteries revealed, some things we know at the beginning, and as the film progresses, we see them in full. \n\nIt is a shame this film didn't get wider distribution, because in the end this film is about confronting the past and the possibility of redemption, it is both heartbreaking and hopeful. It is a lot more than I get from the dreck coming out of Hollywood. \n\nGod Bless ~Amy","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":483,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Romance","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-06-15","keywords":"four word title,title directed by female,written by director,female protagonist,abusive boyfriend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Thousand Kisses Deep","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1763615513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for A Thousand Kisses Deep","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288976/","name":"Emilia Fox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092886/","name":"Jodie Whittaker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001831/","name":"David Warner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527325/","name":"Dana Lustig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293122/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476384/","name":"Alex Kustanovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3730130/","name":"Vadim Moldovan"],"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yes, seven. No, I'm not talking about the David Fincher directed thriller, nor am I referring to Samurai, Dwarfs or the lucky number. In this context, seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.\n\nParticular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts, the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision, studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory "shocker" ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly, director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline, but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes, a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh, as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably, but chiefly, my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loud-mouthed anti-hero category (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Snakes on a Plane), and on the other, his more nuanced (as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be) roles. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-19","keywords":"interracial couple,neighbor,suburb,double standard,suburbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lakeview Terrace: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3043295257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Samuel L.

The first one was okay, as was the second (which I actually preferred to the first). But I'll Always Know is quite obviously the worst of the three, and I'm basing this purely on the merits of this film. I don't really care that the cast isn't the same, and I wasn't even particularly concerned about the obvious plot difficulties surrounding the catalyst death.\n\nThis is a direct-to-video movie, but even keeping that in mind, I can't give this movie better than a 3. The first half to 3/4 of the movie isn't terrible--it's about the level of quality you'd expect (low, but watchable). However, the last part of the movie just disintegrates and really makes it obvious that you made a mistake in ever wasting your time with it. I won't give anything away, but a lot of the movie is spent trying to figure out who this film's Fisherman is. Based on what you know about the three films, try to imagine the absolute WORST idea for the identity of the Fisherman. If you decide to watch this movie, that's the ending you're going to get. I guarantee it. If your idea even halfway seems like it would be decent, you haven't come up with the worst idea yet. \n\nI strongly recommend turning off the film right before the big reveal.\n\nYou've been warned.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11419,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-22","keywords":"cleavage,colorado,bikini,scantily clad female,slasher","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2427322649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWVkM2U2OTktZWI2MC00ZDZkLWIyNzctNDU2YjkzMjg5NjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWVkM2U2OTktZWI2MC00ZDZkLWIyNzctNDU2YjkzMjg5NjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Screen Gems"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627492/","name":"Brooke Nevin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0655959/","name":"David Paetkau"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1722914/","name":"Torrey DeVitto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234893/","name":"Sylvain White"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0242028/","name":"Lois Duncan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919115/","name":"Michael D.

The first one was okay, as was the second (which I actually preferred to the first). But I'll Always Know is quite obviously the worst of the three, and I'm basing this purely on the merits of this film. I don't really care that the cast isn't the same, and I wasn't even particularly concerned about the obvious plot difficulties surrounding the catalyst death.\n\nThis is a direct-to-video movie, but even keeping that in mind, I can't give this movie better than a 3. The first half to 3/4 of the movie isn't terrible--it's about the level of quality you'd expect (low, but watchable). However, the last part of the movie just disintegrates and really makes it obvious that you made a mistake in ever wasting your time with it. I won't give anything away, but a lot of the movie is spent trying to figure out who this film's Fisherman is. Based on what you know about the three films, try to imagine the absolute WORST idea for the identity of the Fisherman. If you decide to watch this movie, that's the ending you're going to get. I guarantee it. If your idea even halfway seems like it would be decent, you haven't come up with the worst idea yet. \n\nI strongly recommend turning off the film right before the big reveal.\n\nYou've been warned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11419,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-22","keywords":"cleavage,colorado,bikini,scantily clad female,slasher","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2427322649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWVkM2U2OTktZWI2MC00ZDZkLWIyNzctNDU2YjkzMjg5NjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWVkM2U2OTktZWI2MC00ZDZkLWIyNzctNDU2YjkzMjg5NjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627492/","name":"Brooke Nevin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0655959/","name":"David Paetkau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1722914/","name":"Torrey DeVitto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234893/","name":"Sylvain White"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0242028/","name":"Lois Duncan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919115/","name":"Michael D.

Although the flamboyantly gay "Stephone" was a Hader favorite on Saturday Night Live, do not expect a stereotype with Milo: this is a human and not a joke.\n\nWiig's Maggie is a flawed character, and both sibs are scarred by their dreadful childhood. How they eventually come to depend on each other is a thing of beauty.\n\nFinally, cheers to Craig Johnson for the way he wrote Luke Wilson's Lance: the straight guy who just wants Maggie to be happy and have his children. Johnson makes him a noble character unlike the buffoon so many in Hollywood would have made of this type.\n\nThe chemistry between Wiig and Hader is incredible, and Wilson is a joy to behold. This is a must-see.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-09-11","keywords":"brother sister relationship,siblings,suicide attempt,adultery,estrangement","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Skeleton Twins","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726134809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyODExZjUtNGFlYy00NzM4LTlkM2YtYjM0YmQwMzI1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyODExZjUtNGFlYy00NzM4LTlkM2YtYjM0YmQwMzI1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer For The Skeleton Twins"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1325419/","name":"Kristen Wiig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005561/","name":"Luke Wilson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2574897/","name":"Craig Johnson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152336/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0402483/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2574897/","name":"Craig Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2114730/","name":"Mark Heyman"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Although the flamboyantly gay "Stephone" was a Hader favorite on Saturday Night Live, do not expect a stereotype with Milo: this is a human and not a joke.\n\nWiig's Maggie is a flawed character, and both sibs are scarred by their dreadful childhood. How they eventually come to depend on each other is a thing of beauty.\n\nFinally, cheers to Craig Johnson for the way he wrote Luke Wilson's Lance: the straight guy who just wants Maggie to be happy and have his children. Johnson makes him a noble character unlike the buffoon so many in Hollywood would have made of this type.\n\nThe chemistry between Wiig and Hader is incredible, and Wilson is a joy to behold. This is a must-see.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-09-11","keywords":"brother sister relationship,siblings,suicide attempt,adultery,estrangement","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Skeleton Twins","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726134809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyODExZjUtNGFlYy00NzM4LTlkM2YtYjM0YmQwMzI1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyODExZjUtNGFlYy00NzM4LTlkM2YtYjM0YmQwMzI1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer For The Skeleton Twins","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1325419/","name":"Kristen Wiig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005561/","name":"Luke Wilson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2574897/","name":"Craig Johnson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152336/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0402483/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2574897/","name":"Craig Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2114730/","name":"Mark Heyman"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In this, the second entry the flames are fanned with her two romantic rivals the handsome and unpredictable detective, Mike and the dependable dentist, Norman. There is some comedy as both men show up at the tree lot buying Hannah a tree. Comedy is had, as one tree is donated to charity and the other the two men attach to Hannah's car. There is some great banter with both mother and sister, as each tries to put their romantic choice forward as the obvious candidate for Hannah. But this is a murder mystery, and post a date with our dentist, Hannah arrives at the tree lot to pick up her check for the cookies. Together Hannah and Norman find the owner's dead body. Mike tries but fails to keep Hannah out of this investigation.\n\nFun cosy mystery that has a bit of a Christmas theme with cookies and plum pudding.

After a routine call take them to an apartments building. There they meet residents,cops, caretaker already in the scenario ; all of them are trapped inside a building quarantined by the CDC after the outbreak of a mysterious virus which becomes humans into bloodthirsty murderers . Acceptable remake full of eerie scenes with zombies and creepy scenes .This following packs a sinister and horrifying atmosphere by means of shaky camera and videotape as well as the former Spanish films titled REC 1, and 2 . The eerie tale deals with a reporter (Jennifer Carpenter )who leads a TV team inside the quarantined building , in which communication means have been cut-off and police agents are not relaying information to those closed inside. They soon learn that a woman living in the building has been infected by something unknown and after that are attacked by the zombie-like creatures . The journalist , a fireman (Jay Hernandez) and his cameraman occupying to spend themselves the night against the zombies . There , they find residents already in the scenario have been possessed by strange demoniac forces . After that , the tenants and inhabitants are brutally attacked by psycho people ; they soon learn that people living in the building has been infected by something unknown. The group attempts the getaway but they only encounter that have been sealed off and try to avoid the bloody attacks .\n\nThis sequel to one of the highest earning horror movies of the last years titled ¨Rec¨ is realized in similar premise to original and contains a good cast as Jennifer Carpenter, Jay Hernandez , Johnathon Schaech ,Steve Harris and Rade Serbedzija. It's a solid movie , a terror story plenty of suspense, restless horror, and in documentary style. Film itself takes place from point of sight from cameraman. The flesh-eating zombies appearance deliver the goods plenty of screams, shocks and tension .The horror moments are compactly made and fast moving . It packs tension, shocks, thrills,chills and lots of gore and blood , but the original is far superior . Well worth seeing if you like shaky cameras, such us ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 Days/Weeks¨ and ¨Cloverfield¨ .

After a routine call take them to an apartments building. There they meet residents,cops, caretaker already in the scenario ; all of them are trapped inside a building quarantined by the CDC after the outbreak of a mysterious virus which becomes humans into bloodthirsty murderers . Acceptable remake full of eerie scenes with zombies and creepy scenes .This following packs a sinister and horrifying atmosphere by means of shaky camera and videotape as well as the former Spanish films titled REC 1, and 2 . The eerie tale deals with a reporter (Jennifer Carpenter )who leads a TV team inside the quarantined building , in which communication means have been cut-off and police agents are not relaying information to those closed inside. They soon learn that a woman living in the building has been infected by something unknown and after that are attacked by the zombie-like creatures . The journalist , a fireman (Jay Hernandez) and his cameraman occupying to spend themselves the night against the zombies . There , they find residents already in the scenario have been possessed by strange demoniac forces . After that , the tenants and inhabitants are brutally attacked by psycho people ; they soon learn that people living in the building has been infected by something unknown. The group attempts the getaway but they only encounter that have been sealed off and try to avoid the bloody attacks .\n\nThis sequel to one of the highest earning horror movies of the last years titled ¨Rec¨ is realized in similar premise to original and contains a good cast as Jennifer Carpenter, Jay Hernandez , Johnathon Schaech ,Steve Harris and Rade Serbedzija. It's a solid movie , a terror story plenty of suspense, restless horror, and in documentary style. Film itself takes place from point of sight from cameraman. The flesh-eating zombies appearance deliver the goods plenty of screams, shocks and tension .The horror moments are compactly made and fast moving . It packs tension, shocks, thrills,chills and lots of gore and blood , but the original is far superior . Well worth seeing if you like shaky cameras, such us ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 Days/Weeks¨ and ¨Cloverfield¨ . Dark cinematography filmed in Downtown, Los Angeles, California, Hollywood, Los Angeles, and Sony Pictures Studios by Ken Seng .The picture produced by Julio Fernandez (Filmax Productions) is professionally directed by John Erik Dowdle but with no originality and based on the Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza film, two magnificent experts on terror genre .

Quarantine 2 was not a movie I had my heart on seeing, basically because I didn't think it could live up to the standard of its predecessor (or the Spanish original.) On that count, I was right. This isn't as good as the first movie. Having said that, one of my tests for any horror movie is whether it has the ability to scare you and make you jump. This one does that, so I have to call it a good movie. It has a lot of chills and jump out of your seat moments, my wife actually screamed at least twice that I recall. It works, in other words. That fright quality isn't as sustained as it is in the first movie, though. In fact, this is pretty slow off the top. A few people board an airplane and they're not feeling too well. If you've seen the first movie, then you know what's happening (or, more to the point, what's going to happen) so you're basically just waiting for it.\n\nOne thing that I noted was that the events of this movie were taking place at the same time as the events of Quarantine. In fact, one of the airplane passengers is using the airplane's wifi to watch a news broadcast about the quarantined building in Los Angeles. While the disease and its effects are pretty much the same, there's more of an effort made here to get to the background and origins of the disease, which is really dealt with only in a few hints toward the end of Quarantine.\n\nQuarantine (and Rec) are filmed in a "Blair Witch" style - hand held cameras recording the action as it takes place. Quarantine 2 takes a more standard approach to movie-making. I think the hand held camera idea has been done to death, quite frankly, so I didn't miss it. It's clear that the ending of this movie was also intended to set up another potential sequel. That was just a little too obvious. Basically, I'd say this isn't as good as the movies that spawned it, but as a horror movie it's still very effective.

For the first third of the movie I felt like the actors were still just "running lines" and we were waiting for the real film with acting and expression to start. Danny asks for Hailey's opinions, suggestions, plans of action all the time and even asks her to interrogate suspects "She won't talk to me ...maybe she'll talk to you?" Really? Jonas has never been to an Art Gallery. He's intimidated by Art. Really? Viv is still only eating at food trucks for lunch. Really? Whatever plot twists Hailey assumes might have happened must have happened. Done deal. Then they follow that trail and arrest whoever is on that path. I must say I wasn't expecting the reveal but I'm sure many other viewers did work out who the killer was. I love this genre when the mysteries are well-constructed and (relatively) believable and the characters are good actors, have good chemistry and good dialogue. I've always enjoyed Kellie Martin's work so let's hope the third part is more watchable and rewarding.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":547,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-06-10","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005192/","name":"Kellie Martin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046420/","name":"Giacomo Baessato"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494892/","name":"Viv Leacock"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0733227/","name":"Michael Robison"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032922/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1456912/","name":"Nancy Grace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3687965/","name":"Michelle Ricci"}],"duration":"PT2H","timeRequired":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For the first third of the movie I felt like the actors were still just "running lines" and we were waiting for the real film with acting and expression to start. Danny asks for Hailey's opinions, suggestions, plans of action all the time and even asks her to interrogate suspects "She won't talk to me ...maybe she'll talk to you?" Really? Jonas has never been to an Art Gallery. He's intimidated by Art. Really? Viv is still only eating at food trucks for lunch. Really? Whatever plot twists Hailey assumes might have happened must have happened. Done deal. Then they follow that trail and arrest whoever is on that path. I must say I wasn't expecting the reveal but I'm sure many other viewers did work out who the killer was. I love this genre when the mysteries are well-constructed and (relatively) believable and the characters are good actors, have good chemistry and good dialogue. I've always enjoyed Kellie Martin's work so let's hope the third part is more watchable and rewarding.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":547,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-06-10","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005192/","name":"Kellie Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046420/","name":"Giacomo Baessato","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494892/","name":"Viv Leacock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0733227/","name":"Michael Robison"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032922/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1456912/","name":"Nancy Grace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3687965/","name":"Michelle Ricci"],"duration":"PT2H","timeRequired":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.\n\nBrilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.\n\nPolanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, "What will happen to us?" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.\n\nA mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's "Summer of Sam" and Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.\n\nSomething worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.\n\nThe Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.\n\n--Shelly","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":773505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-09-25","keywords":"pianist,holocaust,survival,nazi occupied poland,person in a wheelchair falls from height","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pianist","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi988938521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470981/","name":"Thomas Kretschmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277975/","name":"Frank Finlay"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030304/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053177/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844262/","name":"Wladyslaw Szpilman"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

This film has those items sprinkled throughout. For men like me it's reassuring to have an average looking man win the heart of a gorgeously vivacious woman, even after finding out in real life they've been married more than 10 years. And also for married men it's encouraging to see that a woman is willing to fall in love with that man again after that much time has passed. I became so involved with the passage of this romance I fretted over the director dropping the ball in the final minutes, only to be surprised by one of the most convincing and satisfying endings I've seen.\n\nThose actors that supported the main story also supplied a warmth that left an after taste that was richly enjoyable. My mother told me to never criticise other peoples' cooking, but I so enjoyed the film that those little thoughts didn't come to anything. It's not a complicated story, but importantly it's an interesting story, like a favourite meal I can see myself sitting down to enjoy again and again.\n\nI've done a small number of reviews for films that surprised and unexpectedly delighted me, such that I hope you may feel the same. A realistic 7.5 score feels understated but heartfelt.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":146,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1365460/","name":"Julia Benson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1193045/","name":"Peter Benson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3379570/","name":"Tori Barban"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1068982/","name":"Claude Desrosiers"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228741/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5949587/","name":"Gemma Holdway"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film has those items sprinkled throughout. For men like me it's reassuring to have an average looking man win the heart of a gorgeously vivacious woman, even after finding out in real life they've been married more than 10 years. And also for married men it's encouraging to see that a woman is willing to fall in love with that man again after that much time has passed. I became so involved with the passage of this romance I fretted over the director dropping the ball in the final minutes, only to be surprised by one of the most convincing and satisfying endings I've seen.\n\nThose actors that supported the main story also supplied a warmth that left an after taste that was richly enjoyable. My mother told me to never criticise other peoples' cooking, but I so enjoyed the film that those little thoughts didn't come to anything. It's not a complicated story, but importantly it's an interesting story, like a favourite meal I can see myself sitting down to enjoy again and again.\n\nI've done a small number of reviews for films that surprised and unexpectedly delighted me, such that I hope you may feel the same. A realistic 7.5 score feels understated but heartfelt.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":146,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1365460/","name":"Julia Benson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1193045/","name":"Peter Benson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3379570/","name":"Tori Barban"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1068982/","name":"Claude Desrosiers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228741/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5949587/","name":"Gemma Holdway"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Following the war, Piller becomes an investigator assigned the task of identifying and redistributing stolen art, resulting in the flamboyant van Meegeren being accused of collaboration - a crime punishable by death. But, despite mounting evidence, Piller, with the aid of his assistant (Krieps), becomes increasingly convinced of Han's innocence and finds himself in the unlikely position of fighting to save his life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001602/","name":"Guy Pearce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051903/","name":"Claes Bang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3043279/","name":"Vicky Krieps"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6679051/","name":"Dan Friedkin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0473978/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0241129/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650089/","name":"John Orloff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1318843/","name":"Mark Fergus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1319757/","name":"Hawk Ostby"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. \n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":618603,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic. In fact, as the opening titles state, the film is dedicated to "my sister, who made me sit on top of the wardrobe".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Wojtek is a young Polish man who falls in love with a Ukrainian young mother. Fabicki, the film's director, was a promising start. He depicted Polish life as it is in the post Communist world where Poland is trying to rebuild itself as a capitalistic society. Wojtek would learn that money and materialism isn't everything. While Poland has come a long way since Communism, some things still stay the same.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":360,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-11-17","keywords":"fall from height,accident,kissing,male female relationship,marriage proposal","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2252397/","name":"Antoni Pawlicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891502/","name":"Nataliya Vdovina","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102765/","name":"Jacek Braciak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264614/","name":"Slawomir Fabicki"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147152/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264614/","name":"Slawomir Fabicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367885/","name":"Denijal Hasanovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2256587/","name":"Marek Pruchniewski"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. \n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":618603,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

    <desc lang="pl">A Love Yarn: Directed by Peter Burger. With Anna Hutchison, Simon Arblaster, Olivia Tennet, Annie Whittle. The owner of a quaint New Zealand yarn shop, Sophie Markham, gets her world flipped upside down after learning her top supplier of yarn, King Farms, is stopping production. Much to her surprise, the charming yet stuck-in-his-ways Samuel King has traveled all the way from New York to audit the business model of the farm. Desperate to keep her shop going, Sophie convinces Samuel to give her two weeks to learn the ropes of yarn spinning and raise enough money to buy the mill herself. With Samuel's help, Sophie comes up with a fundraising plan to host a "knit-off" and auction at the local makers market.

And it just fails to deliver I did like the ending only because you don't necessarily see that all the time but the movie itself didn't deliver on scares it didn't deliver on even goriness I'd say. It is mediocre is it worth paying for no.

    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

The characters act like the everything they do must be out of perfection. When in reality, some of the film's characters would be gruff, careless people.\n\nThe movie is spellbinding from the first shot. That is undoubtfully because of the character development, which so many movies fail at these days. And not only are they adequately developed, they are engaging. The audience can relate to them as well as understand them. Now these are signs of a superb movie in the making. \n\nThe movie opens with a small boy, about ten years of age, being overtaken by a man who we later learn is a death sentenced escapee. He orders the pedestrian to bring selected materials to him early the next morning, and never to tell a soul of his terrifying experience. He does as he is told.\n\n The boy is named Finnegan Bell, a poor, unfortunate child who lives with his older sister and her husband. The uncle, Joe, soon excepts a job from an extraordinarily eccentric mistress, Ms. Dinsmoor, and her spoiled daughter, Estella. Under circumstances, Finn is able to meet the young girls, about ten years of age as well, and later on becomes close friends with her and the woman \n\nYears pass, Finn is still inevitably attracted to Estella, despite her emotionless personality. Unfortunately, she leaves the state to study her future career. Finn is devastated. He gives up his wonderful talent of art and goes into cruise drive for the next seven years. \n\nAn offer is made to him almost a decade later, to move to New York, where Estella lives at this time, and pursue a career as a professional artist. He excepts, and soon after he arrives, his paths cross with his love once again, but things aren't as they seem at first sight. \n\nDo Finn and Estella follow a life of marriage together? Is Estella still interested in Finn, or does she have other romantic plans? I will not revel the answers to these questions. I will leave it up to you to watch this masterpiece destined to become a romantic classic. However, I will say that if you are not familiar with this old tale from Charles Dickens, things are very unpredictable, and this is not you typical, run-of-the-mill love story.\n\n The performances are truly Oscar worthy, too bad I didn't see this movie when I came out. For I am reviewing it a year later, because I saw it on video, for free, that is. But I certainly would have paid full price to screen this gem, just to tell others how mesmerizing it is.\n\n \tI loved Anne Bancroft, as the crazy widow. She is gorgeous, breathtaking, and one of a kind, as is Paltrow, as Estella herself. Ethan Hawke performs a down-to-earth character with interest and convincing situation. Chris Cooper, Robert DeNiro and Kim Dickens all provide strong supporting role, especially De Niro, but none are on screen enough to make an actual mark.\n\n Another beautiful element in "Great Expectations" is the production design: in the houses the atmosphere is all lush, glamorous and interesting. It provides the characters with a firm foundation, which they certainly take advantage of. As a matter of fact, everyone involved with the creation of the film takes careful interest into everything they do. For this is one of the most luscious movies of the decade.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-01-30","keywords":"estella character,whiskey,cigarette,love,gulf coast","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Great Expectations (1998)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi715850009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmY2UxMDktNTZkYi00MGQ3LTk2Y2QtZDdlN2FmMTZjM2JlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmY2UxMDktNTZkYi00MGQ3LTk2Y2QtZDdlN2FmMTZjM2JlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000279/","name":"Hank Azaria"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079747/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002042/","name":"Charles Dickens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322248/","name":"Mitch Glazer"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A more slow-moving, uninteresting film would be hard to find. Other critics of the film have done a good job of laying out the plot, so I won't take up your time. My low rating is based on the low (lowest) energy that this film puts out. It is as though no one has the energy to show emotion. As though the Portugal heat has had its effect on everyone.

The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.\n\nBrilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.\n\nPolanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, "What will happen to us?" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.\n\nA mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's "Summer of Sam" and Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.\n\nSomething worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.\n\nThe Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.\n\n--Shelly","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":773505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-09-25","keywords":"pianist,holocaust,survival,nazi occupied poland,person in a wheelchair falls from height","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pianist","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi988938521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470981/","name":"Thomas Kretschmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277975/","name":"Frank Finlay"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030304/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053177/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844262/","name":"Wladyslaw Szpilman"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.\n\nPolanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, "What will happen to us?" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.\n\nA mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's "Summer of Sam" and Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.\n\nSomething worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.\n\nThe Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.\n\n--Shelly","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":773505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-09-25","keywords":"pianist,holocaust,survival,nazi occupied poland,person in a wheelchair falls from height","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pianist","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi988938521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470981/","name":"Thomas Kretschmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277975/","name":"Frank Finlay"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030304/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053177/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844262/","name":"Wladyslaw Szpilman"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45206,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-20","keywords":"architect,united states,usa,mother son relationship,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One Fine Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3298689305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926165/","name":"Mae Whitman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195234/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783559/","name":"Terrel Seltzer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800124/","name":"Ellen Simon"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Full credit to all involved, if you are not sure if you want to watch it you should, they did it very well","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"communism,deportation,soviet union,political repression,rape attempt","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ashes in the Snow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi372423193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMzMjQ4YzMtNzI1OC00NzdhLTk1MWMtOWVlMDYwZDNiMjExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2525790/","name":"Bel Powley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2966840/","name":"Lisa Loven Kongsli","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909412/","name":"Martin Wallström"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2101256/","name":"Marius A.

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It stars Sean Connery, Adolfo Celi, Claudine Auger, Rick Van Nutter and Martine Beswick. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.\n\nThe fourth outing for James Bond (Connery) sees 007 assigned to the Bahamas to try and thwart SPECTRE's number 2 operative, Emilio Largo (Celi). Largo has hijacked two atomic bombs from NATO and sets about extorting huge ransoms of money. If his terms are not met he will blow up major cities.\n\nIt was meant to be the first James Bond film, but Thunderball became part of a long drawn out legal battle between Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. Eventually an out of court settlement was reached and Thunderball rolled into theatres in 1965. After the colossal success of Goldfinger, and Bond as a pop culture phenomenon, producers Albert Broccoli &amp; Harry Saltzman knew that they had to try and up the ante to keep Bond on top. They were also acutely aware that many imitators were springing up on film and TV. These facts led Bond to go epic, with the producers going for a more is more approach, however, Thunderball is a considerable step down from Goldfinger.\n\nAs with many other Bond movies, Thunderball polarises opinions amongst the fans. Some are happy to laud the pure entertainment value on offer, the reliance on hardware and gadgets viewed as an aid to the Bond persona and not a hindrance to his humanistic worth. Technically the film is often exceptional, be it on or under the water, director Young really crafts some Bondian quality. The exotic Bahamas locale is beautifully realised by Ted Moore, Barry's blunderbuss score is one of his best for a Bond movie and Connery has charisma in abundance. The girls, too, are delightful, particularly Auger who positively sizzles with sexuality. Bond's by play with M, Q and Felix Leiter (Nutter very enjoyable and more charismatic than Cec Linder in Goldfinger) is well scripted and performed. While for those who adore the gadgets and daring stunts? Thunderball excels with its assortment of trick vehicles, under water weaponry and aids and radioactive pills! Without doubt the near $6 million budget is all up there on the screen.\n\nYet for other fans, and this is the category I fall into, it's a film of too many flaws to be considered one of the greats. Whilst it's undeniable that when it hits the high points it excites royally (the extended underwater battle is eye popping brilliance), but there's too much languid passages in the overlong running time. Young himself lamented that he couldn't get the pace right on account of the plot structure. The other major problem for me is Celi as Largo. Visually he's striking, with his white hair and eye patch, he well looks villainous, but physically he's wrong and someone you can't buy into as a man able to not only take on Bond, but to overcome him as well! While the finale lacks a grandness to reward those having sat for over 2 hours with the film. But what do I know? Film made a stunning $141 million at the box office! And the fanaticism that began with Goldfinger reached epic proportions here.\n\nThe more is more approach worked for the makers, and it ensured that for the time being Bond was going to stay in this epic, gadget effects strewn groove.

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It stars Sean Connery, Adolfo Celi, Claudine Auger, Rick Van Nutter and Martine Beswick. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.\n\nThe fourth outing for James Bond (Connery) sees 007 assigned to the Bahamas to try and thwart SPECTRE's number 2 operative, Emilio Largo (Celi). Largo has hijacked two atomic bombs from NATO and sets about extorting huge ransoms of money. If his terms are not met he will blow up major cities.\n\nIt was meant to be the first James Bond film, but Thunderball became part of a long drawn out legal battle between Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. Eventually an out of court settlement was reached and Thunderball rolled into theatres in 1965. After the colossal success of Goldfinger, and Bond as a pop culture phenomenon, producers Albert Broccoli &amp; Harry Saltzman knew that they had to try and up the ante to keep Bond on top. They were also acutely aware that many imitators were springing up on film and TV. These facts led Bond to go epic, with the producers going for a more is more approach, however, Thunderball is a considerable step down from Goldfinger.\n\nAs with many other Bond movies, Thunderball polarises opinions amongst the fans. Some are happy to laud the pure entertainment value on offer, the reliance on hardware and gadgets viewed as an aid to the Bond persona and not a hindrance to his humanistic worth. Technically the film is often exceptional, be it on or under the water, director Young really crafts some Bondian quality. The exotic Bahamas locale is beautifully realised by Ted Moore, Barry's blunderbuss score is one of his best for a Bond movie and Connery has charisma in abundance. The girls, too, are delightful, particularly Auger who positively sizzles with sexuality. Bond's by play with M, Q and Felix Leiter (Nutter very enjoyable and more charismatic than Cec Linder in Goldfinger) is well scripted and performed. While for those who adore the gadgets and daring stunts? Thunderball excels with its assortment of trick vehicles, under water weaponry and aids and radioactive pills! Without doubt the near $6 million budget is all up there on the screen.\n\nYet for other fans, and this is the category I fall into, it's a film of too many flaws to be considered one of the greats. Whilst it's undeniable that when it hits the high points it excites royally (the extended underwater battle is eye popping brilliance), but there's too much languid passages in the overlong running time. Young himself lamented that he couldn't get the pace right on account of the plot structure. The other major problem for me is Celi as Largo. Visually he's striking, with his white hair and eye patch, he well looks villainous, but physically he's wrong and someone you can't buy into as a man able to not only take on Bond, but to overcome him as well! While the finale lacks a grandness to reward those having sat for over 2 hours with the film. But what do I know? Film made a stunning $141 million at the box office! And the fanaticism that began with Goldfinger reached epic proportions here.\n\nThe more is more approach worked for the makers, and it ensured that for the time being Bond was going to stay in this epic, gadget effects strewn groove. Connery wasn't happy, he had voiced his concerns about Bond becoming characterless, while he hated the mania surrounding the films and his role within them. He would return for the next instalment, You Only Live Twice, question was, would it be his last performance as Bond? 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112960,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1965-12-30","keywords":"underwater battle,official james bond series,007,james bond character,nassau","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Thunderball","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2087978777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4ZjRlYmEtZWRlMy00MDMxLTlhMTctYmNjZjE2M2JkYjU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4ZjRlYmEtZWRlMy00MDMxLTlhMTctYmNjZjE2M2JkYjU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this James Bond film"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000805/","name":"Claudine Auger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148041/","name":"Adolfo Celi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0950109/","name":"Terence Young"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0394200/","name":"John Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926525/","name":"Jack Whittingham"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It starts as a comedy, something you might expect because of the main actress, but soon the situations become real and more dramatic.\n\nThe rest of the cast includes well known actors like Alfred Molina, Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Margot Robbie.\n\nOverall: Don't expect a comedy because of Tina Fey. It starts like that but it evolves to other genres really quick. It might not be a great movie but it's not boring and you get something out of the inner journey of the protagonist.

It starts as a comedy, something you might expect because of the main actress, but soon the situations become real and more dramatic.\n\nThe rest of the cast includes well known actors like Alfred Molina, Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Margot Robbie.\n\nOverall: Don't expect a comedy because of Tina Fey. It starts like that but it evolves to other genres really quick. It might not be a great movie but it's not boring and you get something out of the inner journey of the protagonist. How easy is to feel unnatural situations as normal when you are a long way from home...","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-03-04","keywords":"afghanistan,journalist,karaoke,dancing,infidelity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2132324889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NjkyODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcxNTA1NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NjkyODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcxNTA1NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the Kim Barker's memoir, Tina Fey plays a journalist reporting from war-town Afghanistan and Pakistan.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275629/","name":"Glenn Ficarra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0720135/","name":"John Requa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013731/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199243/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1061622/","name":"Robert Carlock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5092324/","name":"Kim Barker"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Go ahead and call it "Aaron Brockovich." But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means. Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death. I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep. I love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it. The fight continues to this day.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2019-12-06","keywords":"environmental pollution,water pollution,lawyer as protagonist,chemical pollution,chemical contamination","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3717512985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the true story of Robert Bilott, an attorney who took on the DuPont company in an environmental suit exposing a decades-long history of chemical pollution in drinking water."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000209/","name":"Tim Robbins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0783031/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484360/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10164264/","name":"Nathaniel Rich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3918350/","name":"Mario Correa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1996352/","name":"Matthew Michael Carnahan"}],"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Go ahead and call it "Aaron Brockovich." But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means. Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death. I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep. I love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it. The fight continues to this day.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2019-12-06","keywords":"environmental pollution,water pollution,lawyer as protagonist,chemical pollution,chemical contamination","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3717512985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the true story of Robert Bilott, an attorney who took on the DuPont company in an environmental suit exposing a decades-long history of chemical pollution in drinking water.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000209/","name":"Tim Robbins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0783031/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484360/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10164264/","name":"Nathaniel Rich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3918350/","name":"Mario Correa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1996352/","name":"Matthew Michael Carnahan"],"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's lean and mean, a bit melodramatic in a few scenes, but also tough to stomach for its cruel depiction of corruption and murderous police units. Viewers follow a woman who loses her husband after he gets shot by unknown assailants. This prompts her to try and look for his murderers, and her search leads her to a police inspector who promises they will be found if she agrees to work for him as an informant. However, she soon realizes this also includes being part of a hit squad... the plot moves forward with no stop gaps after this point. It's a straightforward film that dabbles in complicated real life issues revolving around the Philippines' uncompromising police operations. Drug users and dealers are taken out with little thought given to their current affairs. If they're on the ominous drug watch list, it's uncertain how long they have left before a hit squad comes for them. Acting is convincing and cinematography vivid and gritty, especially in nighttime scenes, further amplifying the film's tense and morally grey narrative. Some of the more apparent flaws here include a feeling of predictability, as many events are easy to foresee, while the film also tends to state the obvious in some of the dialogues. This doesn't detract from the overall impression, though, that Watch List is a pretty good film that should appeal to most crime thriller fans.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-02-19","keywords":"children","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch List","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4117675545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU2Nzg4MGUtOTIyZi00NTEyLWI3NDYtMTA3NTEwOTU3NTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU2Nzg4MGUtOTIyZi00NTEyLWI3NDYtMTA3NTEwOTU3NTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010355/","name":"Arthur Acuña"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6041424/","name":"Bernard Carritero"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211278/","name":"Alessandra de Rossi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1266863/","name":"Ben Rekhi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309252/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799784/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1266863/","name":"Ben Rekhi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2891978/","name":"Rona Lean Sales"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You can see why from the rugged dusty landscapes of Andalucia Benito Zambrano uses in 'Intemperie'. Rather clumsily titled 'Out in the Open' in English, doesn't really capture the essence of this chase western, 'Runaway' or 'On The Run' would be better. Without wanting to repeat the information provided by other reviews which is excellent, just wanted to add my voice to those who enjoyed the film. The 3 leads are outstanding and worthy of note. What an actor Luis Tosar is, in this role playing the war veteran turned nomadic herdsman 'Moor', so much screen presence, but also Jaime López is compelling as the child runaway, and Luis Callejo chillingly psychotic in the role of the cruel landholder. Many other aspects of the film are admirable, I'll leave people to make up their own minds ... highly recommended!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1221,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-11-22","keywords":"kid,child,nameless character,shepherd,wasteland","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3323706393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0N2VlMjktNTNhYS00NTJjLWE5MTgtYjc5NmFkYzBjMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0N2VlMjktNTNhYS00NTJjLWE5MTgtYjc5NmFkYzBjMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0869088/","name":"Luis Tosar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0130429/","name":"Luis Callejo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7235691/","name":"Jaime López"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952583/","name":"Benito Zambrano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048117/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071642/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0809116/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5488769/","name":"Jesús Carrasco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2515343/","name":"Daniel Remón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1932665/","name":"Pablo Remón"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You can see why from the rugged dusty landscapes of Andalucia Benito Zambrano uses in 'Intemperie'. Rather clumsily titled 'Out in the Open' in English, doesn't really capture the essence of this chase western, 'Runaway' or 'On The Run' would be better. Without wanting to repeat the information provided by other reviews which is excellent, just wanted to add my voice to those who enjoyed the film. The 3 leads are outstanding and worthy of note. What an actor Luis Tosar is, in this role playing the war veteran turned nomadic herdsman 'Moor', so much screen presence, but also Jaime López is compelling as the child runaway, and Luis Callejo chillingly psychotic in the role of the cruel landholder. Many other aspects of the film are admirable, I'll leave people to make up their own minds ... highly recommended!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1221,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-11-22","keywords":"kid,child,nameless character,shepherd,wasteland","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3323706393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0N2VlMjktNTNhYS00NTJjLWE5MTgtYjc5NmFkYzBjMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0N2VlMjktNTNhYS00NTJjLWE5MTgtYjc5NmFkYzBjMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0869088/","name":"Luis Tosar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0130429/","name":"Luis Callejo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7235691/","name":"Jaime López"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952583/","name":"Benito Zambrano"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048117/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071642/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0809116/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5488769/","name":"Jesús Carrasco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2515343/","name":"Daniel Remón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1932665/","name":"Pablo Remón"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But that counts and is all very well done, and the director and lead actor showed up after the film for a fairly lengthy discussion. Lara was one of my most anticipated movies of this year because I love the first film Jan-Ole Gerster did, Oh Boy. This one yet again tells a big story in a down to earth and believable form where the way characters act and speak tells you all you need to know about them, and then some. Yet again it's also about family and being in a bad place in life. Lara, different from his first film, is for a big part about passion and creativity, and it's beautifully directed and written, and of course the performances are great. I'm very happy it turned out so well and hope it won't take Gerster seven years again to put out a new film. I don't know what took him so long, maybe it was just about financing.

But that counts and is all very well done, and the director and lead actor showed up after the film for a fairly lengthy discussion. Lara was one of my most anticipated movies of this year because I love the first film Jan-Ole Gerster did, Oh Boy. This one yet again tells a big story in a down to earth and believable form where the way characters act and speak tells you all you need to know about them, and then some. Yet again it's also about family and being in a bad place in life. Lara, different from his first film, is for a big part about passion and creativity, and it's beautifully directed and written, and of course the performances are great. I'm very happy it turned out so well and hope it won't take Gerster seven years again to put out a new film. I don't know what took him so long, maybe it was just about financing. Anyway, see this one if you can please, it's definitely worth a watch and so full of life, never boring, always being real, and you can tell they really cared about making this as good as it can be. This is a film everyone will be able to get something out of. Fittingly, at one point a character thinks to himself, does the world really need my music or has it been done already and is pointless.

It all starts with a small family gathering over the weekend, nothing out of the ordinary at first sight. Rather than getting into the usual annoyances and uneasy relationships common with family in law, or old bones to pick between brothers and sisters, the weekend starts unproblematic. Plans have been made previously for a do-it-yourself form of euthanasia, which is illegal almost everywhere. Yet we learn that everyone involved has accepted the procedure. The timing is such that the mother can take the pills by herself, without help, something not possible anymore when her illness worsens, the latter due in 1 or 2 months. Her husband can say that she did it all by herself while he took a walk, particularly important as a precaution because as a doctor he certainly cannot be suspected of any active involvement in such a procedure.\n\nThe group of relatives assembled for the weekend in question is well chosen, from a plot perspective, with very diverse characters and attitudes, albeit that there are not so many family members that we lose track on the respective opinions and motives. In spite of the a priori agreement on the whole process, we observe that some are getting cold feet and we see them wanting to postpone or even dismiss the whole procedure. Reasons for it vary but are certainly genuine and we can follow their trains of thought very well. These withdrawals happen with one after the other, each with different motives, and each eventually coming along and prepared to stick to the original plan. It sounds confusing but the script is well designed and the timing is perfect.\n\nOne example, to illustrate the sort of objections, is that one daughter regrets that she did not spend enough time with her mother in the past, having given more thought to her career and other priorities elsewhere. Now that she has more time on her hands, she welcomes the opportunity to renew the relationship with her mother, and to discuss matters of mutual interest. This is something that I can understand fully, as having similar ideas myself over having not spent sufficient time with my parents, in spite of them devoting ample time to me when I was young. A second argument of the daughter is that doctors can be wrong in their predictions, in other words that the planned euthanasia is much too soon, and that medicine can be invented in the meantime to prolong her life for many years to come. All this is just an example of aforementioned turns of events, everything just rational and understandable, yet endangering the plans that were so well thought through.\n\nIt is an achievement in itself that it all happened on screen within 97 minutes, in a limited time span in which not a second was wasted, letting events pass by in a logical order and evenly spread over time. Don't assume an overall gloomy atmosphere, since there is ample humor included in spite of the circumstances.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1733,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-11-13","keywords":"weekend,family relationships,euthanasia","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639152/","name":"Ghita Nørby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824785/","name":"Paprika Steen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4439530/","name":"Danica Curcic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000806/","name":"Bille August"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0249327/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054911/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048411/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1311535/","name":"Christian Torpe"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. \n\nYou have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. \n\nEdge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. \n\nThe tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-06-04","keywords":"time loop,alien,alien invasion,dying repeatedly,combat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3591679257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier fighting in a war with aliens finds himself caught in a time loop of his last day in the battle, though he becomes better skilled along the way.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510731/","name":"Doug Liman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890871/","name":"John-Henry Butterworth"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And even if it's not as refreshing &amp; impressive as Fast Five, it nonetheless succeeds as another thrilling, ridiculously entertaining &amp; undeniably fun extravaganza.\n\nThe story of Fast &amp; Furious 6 concerns Dominic Toretto &amp; his crew, all of whom have retired to a comfortable life following the heist they pulled off in the previous chapter yet they still remain wanted fugitives in their homeland. But when Hobbs asks for their services to take down a skilled mercenary organisation in exchange for clearing their criminal records, Dom accepts the deal and reassembles his team to finish one last job.\n\nDirected by Justin Lin, Fast &amp; Furious 6 is his final stint with this franchise and he decides to go out on a high note by delivering a picture that's far too enjoyable to worry about the laws of physics being bent here on few occasions. The screenplay packs in an interesting plot filled with excellent use of humour but it isn't as tightly gripped as the last instalment and is a slight step down in comparison. But a few elements do get an upgrade.\n\nThe technical aspects follow the same formula that was applied in Fast Five and there isn't much to complain here for the set pieces look spectacularly detailed, the action sequences benefit a lot from its energetic camera-work, brilliant editing &amp; more use of practical effects just like the last chapter although at times the action goes way too over-the-top yet not so exaggerated for most viewers to suspend disbelief. And the background score is fitting for the most part.\n\nComing to the performances, the entire main cast that was present in the last one reprises its role, Michelle Rodrigues also returns to join the gang and Luke Evans is the new addition who plays this chapter's antagonist. Vin Diesel &amp; Paul Walker do their usual best as Toretto &amp; O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson continues to impress as Hobbs, However, Evans doesn't get enough screen time to show his mettle and his characters turns out to be a generic villain. The rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions.\n\nOn an overall scale, Fast &amp; Furious 6 builds upon the very ingredients that worked in favour of Fast Five and, barring a couple of issues, manages to stay on the track for the most part. Although not as amazing as the previous entry, this is nevertheless an immensely enjoyable blockbuster material that promises a lot of fun &amp; thrills, and effectively delivers it. Definitely more style than substance although the margin isn't as vast as it had been in the first four chapters of this franchise, Fast &amp; Furious 6 comes delightfully recommended."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":382793,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-05-22","keywords":"canary islands,reference to spain,reference to the incredible hulk,humvee,brian o'conner character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225003545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxMjgxODEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQyNjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxMjgxODEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQyNjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":" Agent Hobbs enlists the aid of Dom and team to help bring a rival gang, led by Owen Shaw, to justice.

And even if it's not as refreshing &amp; impressive as Fast Five, it nonetheless succeeds as another thrilling, ridiculously entertaining &amp; undeniably fun extravaganza.\n\nThe story of Fast &amp; Furious 6 concerns Dominic Toretto &amp; his crew, all of whom have retired to a comfortable life following the heist they pulled off in the previous chapter yet they still remain wanted fugitives in their homeland. But when Hobbs asks for their services to take down a skilled mercenary organisation in exchange for clearing their criminal records, Dom accepts the deal and reassembles his team to finish one last job.\n\nDirected by Justin Lin, Fast &amp; Furious 6 is his final stint with this franchise and he decides to go out on a high note by delivering a picture that's far too enjoyable to worry about the laws of physics being bent here on few occasions. The screenplay packs in an interesting plot filled with excellent use of humour but it isn't as tightly gripped as the last instalment and is a slight step down in comparison. But a few elements do get an upgrade.\n\nThe technical aspects follow the same formula that was applied in Fast Five and there isn't much to complain here for the set pieces look spectacularly detailed, the action sequences benefit a lot from its energetic camera-work, brilliant editing &amp; more use of practical effects just like the last chapter although at times the action goes way too over-the-top yet not so exaggerated for most viewers to suspend disbelief. And the background score is fitting for the most part.\n\nComing to the performances, the entire main cast that was present in the last one reprises its role, Michelle Rodrigues also returns to join the gang and Luke Evans is the new addition who plays this chapter's antagonist. Vin Diesel &amp; Paul Walker do their usual best as Toretto &amp; O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson continues to impress as Hobbs, However, Evans doesn't get enough screen time to show his mettle and his characters turns out to be a generic villain. The rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions.\n\nOn an overall scale, Fast &amp; Furious 6 builds upon the very ingredients that worked in favour of Fast Five and, barring a couple of issues, manages to stay on the track for the most part. Although not as amazing as the previous entry, this is nevertheless an immensely enjoyable blockbuster material that promises a lot of fun &amp; thrills, and effectively delivers it. Definitely more style than substance although the margin isn't as vast as it had been in the first four chapters of this franchise, Fast &amp; Furious 6 comes delightfully recommended.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":382793,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-05-22","keywords":"canary islands,reference to spain,reference to the incredible hulk,humvee,brian o'conner character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225003545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxMjgxODEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQyNjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxMjgxODEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQyNjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":" Agent Hobbs enlists the aid of Dom and team to help bring a rival gang, led by Owen Shaw, to justice.

We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.\n\nBut its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.\n\nThe other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That "viewing" piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice. \n\nIts all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.\n\nSo why am I unhappy?\n\nBecause the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.\n\nHere, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled. \n\nYes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for?

It certainly falls far short of other great financial movies – the Big Short, Margin Call, and Smartest Guys in the Room, to name a few. Worth watching but not likely a movie to savor, add closure, provide moral assurance, or make you feel anything. Too many moving pieces that lack grounding – the timeline has no center and the flashbacks and jumps forward are too disjoint, too many supporting characters are painted as morally ambiguous, and the many defrauded clients are nameless and faceless. \n\nAs for the some of the details, it's hard to get around Michelle Pfeiffer accent. It may be spot-on but the voice is just annoying. Add in Robert De Niro's unbalanced intonations and a discordant soundtrack and sound-editing and it is not a movie that will sit well with your ears.\n\nIt should have been done as a 3-4 part mini-series. They would have had a lot more time to not only relay the full time line and details of the case but also go into the many interesting sub-stories and tragedies. For example, the efforts of Harry Markopolos to unmask the fraud is addressed only by showing Bernie and Ruth watching 30 seconds of testimony on the TV in their condo. The questions of the hundreds of millions potentially transferred to London accounts for the benefit of Madoff relatives is not explored. The ineptitude of the SEC, FINRA and other agencies is also given short-shrift. Did you know that Shana Madoff, the chief compliance officer and niece of Bernie Madoff, married an Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations and Examinations at the SEC. They met in 2003 when he was performing an examination as to whether Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme. The SEC Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations attended their wedding in 2007. \n\nAs it is, the movie dips its toe into the $64.8B (yes $64.8 billion) fraud case and provides some insights as to who in the inner circle may or may not have been culpable– all in the course largely telling a family drama. Interesting and entertaining, yes. A good film, meh. Disappointing for what it could have been, most definitely.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: The Wizard of Lies: Directed by Barry Levinson. With Robert De Niro, Diana Henriques, Nathan Darrow, Alessandro Nivola.

It certainly falls far short of other great financial movies – the Big Short, Margin Call, and Smartest Guys in the Room, to name a few. Worth watching but not likely a movie to savor, add closure, provide moral assurance, or make you feel anything. Too many moving pieces that lack grounding – the timeline has no center and the flashbacks and jumps forward are too disjoint, too many supporting characters are painted as morally ambiguous, and the many defrauded clients are nameless and faceless. \n\nAs for the some of the details, it's hard to get around Michelle Pfeiffer accent. It may be spot-on but the voice is just annoying. Add in Robert De Niro's unbalanced intonations and a discordant soundtrack and sound-editing and it is not a movie that will sit well with your ears.\n\nIt should have been done as a 3-4 part mini-series. They would have had a lot more time to not only relay the full time line and details of the case but also go into the many interesting sub-stories and tragedies. For example, the efforts of Harry Markopolos to unmask the fraud is addressed only by showing Bernie and Ruth watching 30 seconds of testimony on the TV in their condo. The questions of the hundreds of millions potentially transferred to London accounts for the benefit of Madoff relatives is not explored. The ineptitude of the SEC, FINRA and other agencies is also given short-shrift. Did you know that Shana Madoff, the chief compliance officer and niece of Bernie Madoff, married an Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations and Examinations at the SEC. They met in 2003 when he was performing an examination as to whether Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme. The SEC Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations attended their wedding in 2007. \n\nAs it is, the movie dips its toe into the $64.8B (yes $64.8 billion) fraud case and provides some insights as to who in the inner circle may or may not have been culpable– all in the course largely telling a family drama. Interesting and entertaining, yes. A good film, meh. Disappointing for what it could have been, most definitely.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They do ridiculous things like move halfway across the world for someone whose phone number they don't even have, whom they've only met once. They stalk and tease, smile then snub, lure and reject, hide and seek, like two idiot children. I think it's intended to show a "different" kind of romance, for schizoid people, but it's just too unrealistic, the characters too dull. A "romance" like this would likely end in an eventual murder over some minor misunderstanding, because there is only so much one can "communicate" through creepy blank-eyed autistic stares. The female shows many signs of latent psychopathic tendencies &amp; pre-menopausal psychosis. She goes ape when she sees the man with his daughter, perceiving the girl as a romantic rival; she casually toys with the affections of a third-party peripheral character, just to use him as cover while she stalks her chubby prey.

They do ridiculous things like move halfway across the world for someone whose phone number they don't even have, whom they've only met once. They stalk and tease, smile then snub, lure and reject, hide and seek, like two idiot children. I think it's intended to show a "different" kind of romance, for schizoid people, but it's just too unrealistic, the characters too dull. A "romance" like this would likely end in an eventual murder over some minor misunderstanding, because there is only so much one can "communicate" through creepy blank-eyed autistic stares. The female shows many signs of latent psychopathic tendencies &amp; pre-menopausal psychosis. She goes ape when she sees the man with his daughter, perceiving the girl as a romantic rival; she casually toys with the affections of a third-party peripheral character, just to use him as cover while she stalks her chubby prey. The male lead should be terrified of this nut-job, not charmed by her. If she were a 5 instead of a 10, stalking a man like this, the film would be classified as a Horror movie. Luckily, as a 10, all her bizarre &amp; alarming behavior is written off as merely "quirky", even romantic. There is no story here, so don't bother paying much attention.

I keep turning to LMN even though I know better. Around every corner the male lead keeps his mouth shut when we all know that in real life, any person would speak up in order to fix the present problem. Not this guy. It's as if the writers were too lazy and just had the main character do everything he could to keep falling deeper and deeper into the traps set by the crazy character. Nothing new and not worth your time. You'll just cuss out the lead while being bored by the lame script.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-07-26","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000407/","name":"Vivica A.

OK, he may not be better than ever but he's better than he's been in some time. GoldenEye has a great opening scene that is more entertaining than most entire movies.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly.

Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it's likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated, oversexed, over special "effected" and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out. Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92043,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"chateau,provence france,inheritance,based on novel,wine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Good Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1823736089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180411/","name":"Abbie Cornish","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458884/","name":"Marc Klein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562706/","name":"Peter Mayle"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.\n\nSo far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies, with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the too-dumb-for-it's-own-good Strange Wilderness and the dumb-but-fun Harold &amp; Kumar. However, despite coming in late to the game, the old expression of "saving the best 'till last" seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time, Pineapple Express feels silly, but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters, start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime, car-chases, comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles, but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect, but the writers get it spot on here.\n\nMain characters Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) and Saul Silver (James Franco) may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes, but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead, they deal with drugs; Saul is Dale's supplier, and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy, Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However, after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drug-dealer crimelords, the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship, and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty, the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure, this isn't a hallmark drama, there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable; it's a story about two regular guys, who get into crazy shenanigans, smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se, but it's entertaining, and down to earth.\n\nThis is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors, as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action, but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable action-packed plot, the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters, but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.\n\nComing from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad, Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish, combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around, the pacing isn't quite as tight, and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off, and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments, jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time, losing momentum, yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between, and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion; the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless, if you don't mind profane dialogue, blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect, then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.\n\nAnd that's all it basically comes down to, but what else were you expecting? As a movie, Pineaple Express is an entertaining and at times sweet take on friendship based around two very down to earth characters that most people should be able to relate to in some way or another. As a duo, Rogan and Franco are extremely well matched, with the interplay between the two coming off as naturally comical and aptly delivered to the point of satisfying the movie's biggest pulling point and focus. With some great action scenes tinged with plenty of comedy, all revolving around some memorable characters portrayed by enthusiastic, suitably cast performers who end up within a plot which is admittedly hammy, but fun all the same; Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh, and it does so with enough frequency to make this one of this year's greater comedies.\n\n\n* Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":326487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up,handcuffed man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

With some great action scenes tinged with plenty of comedy, all revolving around some memorable characters portrayed by enthusiastic, suitably cast performers who end up within a plot which is admittedly hammy, but fun all the same; Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh, and it does so with enough frequency to make this one of this year's greater comedies.\n\n\n* Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":326487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up,handcuffed man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

OK, he may not be better than ever but he's better than he's been in some time. GoldenEye has a great opening scene that is more entertaining than most entire movies. It involves bungee jumping, guns, motorcycles, planes, and nerve gas among other things. Pierce Brosnan's first effort as Bond is a remarkable one. The movie has good acting, good action, and humor. It's great escapism from start to finish. The women are beautiful and Famke Jannsen and Sean Bean play their roles well.

Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92043,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"chateau,provence france,inheritance,based on novel,wine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Good Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1823736089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM2ZTM3ZTAtMGFkYy00OTgzLWFhMTktNzFiYjFlYTFkMmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180411/","name":"Abbie Cornish","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458884/","name":"Marc Klein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562706/","name":"Peter Mayle"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. \n\nThe acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic.

Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. \n\nThe acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders. The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller. The cameo by the ecstatic Indian astronaut singing around "Mera jootha hai Japani" in space was hilarious as well. \n\nOther than being an adventurous suspense thriller, the slow character- development helps us to form an emotional bond as well.

I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, "This is it! This is the movie!" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1365346,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2005-06-16","keywords":"superhero,social decay,dc comics,gotham,well","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"4K Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi362988313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJhYTcxYzgtOTI3My00ZTI1LWI3NzAtZTljMTFjM2ViOGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJhYTcxYzgtOTI3My00ZTI1LWI3NzAtZTljMTFjM2ViOGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":"After training with his mentor, Batman begins his fight to free crime-ridden Gotham City from corruption."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913822/","name":"Ken Watanabe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038332/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004170/","name":"Bob Kane"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275286/","name":"David S.

My take on this is the subject matter cannot go in that many directions. You can find similarities in every films about choir boys. Heck even the hit cult French film "The Chorist is far from original and recycle story lines from films that came before it. In most of these films you will get a trouble boy or boys who gets his or their life changed by his or their new found love of singing. This film is no different and if you are aware of that before going into it you will see the good point of that film rather then the fact that it is a very familiar story. Young and troubled Stet (Garrett Wareing) is sent to a Choir school by his father he never met before (Stet is a secret son,the product of a one night stand) following the death of his junkie mother. Things start roughly as Stet is accepted via bribe by his father desperate to put his son somewhere so he can be back to his real family. This causes some students and teachers to only see Stet as a charity case with no real musical talent.However Stet determination pays off and the main teacher Mr Carvelle (Dustin Hoffman) finally start noticing that their might be more to the boy then meet the eye. So yes pretty straightforward story and yes it sound like a TV movie from lifetime but you know what it has a good heart and all the actors seems to really enjoy themselves. Kathy Bates as the overworked headmistress ,Eddy Izzard as a competitive teacher , Kevin McHale as the teacher who first notice Stet's talent along with Hoffman creates a very interesting dynamic and they breath life to the school. Garrett Wareing is easy to root for as Stet , he his misunderstood and a victim of his upbringing.The actor convey that sense of wanting to break free from the tag everybody has placed on him all his life and he convey a quiet sort of will power and maturity really well. The only thing that bothered me is Stet's relationship with his father felt rushed and underdeveloped and they wrapped this storyline conveniently.It is a shame as it was intriguing and it could have been explored a lot more. With that said , listen ! Yeah this films has received a lot of bad review for being too "Simple" but people who are interested in theses type of films should not be looking for "Interstellar" they should be looking for a sweet little heart warmer with excellent music and songs and this film do that!

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. \n\nYou have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. \n\nEdge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. \n\nThe tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-06-04","keywords":"time loop,alien,alien invasion,dying repeatedly,combat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3591679257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier fighting in a war with aliens finds himself caught in a time loop of his last day in the battle, though he becomes better skilled along the way.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510731/","name":"Doug Liman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890871/","name":"John-Henry Butterworth"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The acting was flawless about an era I knew well. The acting was so good I forgot about who was portraying whom. Bryan Cranston cannot be lauded enough.\n\nOur nation is on the precipice of returning to those noxious racist-filled days as we are poised to elect a wingnut demagogue to office supported by many racist whites even of the KKK and white nationalist supremacist variety. Have we learned NOTHING from our tragic racist past? Is Vietnam but a memory and the race relations of Jim Crow tucked away neatly in the crevices of our national mind?

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Visually distraught, he leaves a hearing in tears and sets off a media circus. Seasoned reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) was his roommate in college, and the two have remained friends. In a bid to quash the political blogging of junior reporter Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), McAffrey sets out to find the truth about the story.\n\nState of Play sets itself up early on to be a cookie-cutter, predictable thriller. But as the film progresses, it rather quickly becomes the twisty and conniving thriller it needs to be. Despite being heavily dialogue driven, the film is an intense ride that will keep people on edge throughout. Some scenes are downright terrifying in their amped up suspense and political intrigue. This film really set out to be tense, and succeeds wonderfully. It knows just what punches to pull, and when to pull them.\n\nThe script, written by political scribes Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilory and Billy Ray, is insight and intriguing. It could have easily been made boring and inundated with rehashed politicalisms (like all of their last films), but this film revels in how interesting it becomes. It has laughs strung throughout (a genuine surprise), and lacks the nerve to become loaded to the brim with facts and innuendos. Instead, it expertly weaves between scenes, amping up the intensity of some scenes, and downplaying others.\n\nBut this is mainly due to the incredible performances by the cast. Crowe (who I usually loathe) and Affleck are simply outstanding in their roles. Age issues aside, both play their character with finesse and charisma. Affleck looks and acts like a confused wet-behind-the-ears, gunning-for-higher-office political pawn from beginning to end. Some of the reactions on his face are downright devastating in how excellently they are conveyed. And this is a guy critics once said could not act. Coupled with one-two shot of acting in Hollywoodland and directing Gone Baby Gone, we may be seeing a renewed resonance and importance for the Oscar-winner. Crowe on the other hand, delivers his strongest performance in years. While he has been downplayed and underused in his last few films, he carries this film. He is stubborn and vaguely likable, but he makes his character work for all of his idiosyncrasies and ethically-questionable tactics. He makes a seasoned journalist look like an amateur.\n\nMcAdams, all but a ghost recently, holds her own against the two heavy-hitters and delivers a performance that is both inspired and emotional. It gives her a lot of room to act, and she delivers in every instance. The rest of the cast is a bit mixed however, as so little of them is given that much to do. Harry Lennix, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, the horrifying Michael Berresse and especially Jason Bateman, all deliver noteworthy performances, but never get to really shine in them. They all have their traits and motivations, but get little screen time to truly express them. They each are developed quite strongly, but they lack the movement afforded to Crowe, Affleck and McAdams. I simply loved Helen Mirren's scenery-gauging editor and all of her subtleties. But she too, is downplayed to the point of almost barely being in the film.\n\nDespite its intensity, the film is bogged down by its dialogue-heavy scenes and consistent character additions. It is easy to keep track of everyone, but so many people are introduced that the film loses its focus on more than one occasion. It makes for a few scenes that are merely filler between the scenes of useful heavy acting. It just feels so tiring. I understand now how daunting a task it must have been to convert six hours of British television into a 127-minute film, but there are scenes that are just too easy to not have been cut out (some entire mildly useful subplots may have helped). Adding characters in makes sense for a story about two journalists frantically searching to lift the lid on a story, but there needs to be more emphasis on what was needed and not needed. A brilliant montage in the middle of the film goes almost entirely to waste because the filmmakers lack the knowledge of what should be cut. Limiting the preposterous and silly climax could have also done wonders. The scenes that are left in the film (including the finale) are great, but they could have been stronger if they were as tightly wound as the film wants itself to be. A little less shaky hand camera movement could have also significantly benefited the film.\n\nEven with its problems, it is clear from the on-set of the first shot in the bullpen at the Washington Globe that the filmmakers are going for a very keen sense of homage to All the President's Men. While the on-going and very professional relationship between McAffrey and Frye is very similar to Woodward and Bernstein, the fabric of journalistic integrity and researching are the core of State of Play. The film is loaded with allusions to the Oscar-winning film, and even mimics shots right out of the film. While it is obvious for anyone who has seen Men, this film's nods are done in such a delicate and unique way that they never become distracting or blatant. The film is its own, and does not ever feel like it is living in its big-brother's shadow. It is a fresh take on old-fashioned reporting in a very digital age, and frequently walks the tight line of old versus new.\n\nState of Play looked interesting, and surprisingly delivers on almost every count. It is not a perfect film, but it is a solid example of great film-making. It wants to be more, but seems content at being a twisty and suspenseful modern thriller. \n\n8/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":147982,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2009-05-20","keywords":"conspiracy,congressman,newspaper,political conspiracy,print journalism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"State of Play: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2483225369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTU5NzYzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwMDkzMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTU5NzYzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwMDkzMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Picture-perfect U.S. congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) seems to be the rising star in the world of politics -- until his research assistant, who was also his mistress, is murdered.

Visually distraught, he leaves a hearing in tears and sets off a media circus. Seasoned reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) was his roommate in college, and the two have remained friends. In a bid to quash the political blogging of junior reporter Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), McAffrey sets out to find the truth about the story.\n\nState of Play sets itself up early on to be a cookie-cutter, predictable thriller.

I thought Christmas with the Kranks was quite hilarious and ignored the sappy meaning of Christmas theme until the final 20 minutes. However once the movie reached that portion of the movie it slowed down painfully and left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nThe story is pretty basic, Blair Krank, played by Julie Gonzalo (Freaky Friday,) joins the Peace Corp. and heads to Peru during the holidays for a full year. The Kranks, Luther, played by Tim Allen (The Santa Clause 1, 2) and Nora, played by Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, True Lies,) decide to boycott Christmas and head to the Caribbean on a cruise, much to the dismay of the neighborhood lead by Vic Frohmeyer, played by Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters, 50 first dates.) On Christmas Eve, Blair calls and tells her parents that she is coming home for Christmas with her boyfriend who wants to experience a true American Christmas with parties, snow and all of the trimmings. So it's a race against the clock to see if they can pull it off before she gets home.\n\nLike I said the beginning of the movie is quite hilarious. The scenes between the Kranks and their neighbors who want them to celebrate Christmas are the funniest I have seen in a Christmas movie since Natl. Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Luther with his Botox is just great.\n\nHowever, the last 20 minutes of the movie when the Kranks are trying to get the Christmas Eve party together, with the help of the whole neighborhood, drags the movie down a lot., so much in fact that you almost forget the laughter in the first act of the movie. There is also a pointless couple of scenes with a burglar that don't make since.\n\nI thought Tim Allen and Jaime Lee Curtis were cast perfectly for each other, all though at times Curtis reminded me of Patricia Richardson who played Allen's wife in the TV show Home Improvement. Along with Aykroyd, the supporting cast is full of very recognizable faces and some even provide humor to the story.\n\nOverall, I say that this movie is a pretty good Christmas movie. If the last half of the movie was as funny as the first half, and if they would have ignored the whole spirit of Christmas message, this movie would have been as great as my favorite Christmas movie of all time, the afore mentioned National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. However, since it wasn't and they didn't, this movie only gets a pretty good rating. But I still say go see and ignore the rest of those idiot reviewers and listen to me! *This movie review and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com*","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45808,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2004-11-24","keywords":"bikini,christmas,cat,singing,arrest","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Christmas with the Kranks","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2092826905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk0MTdmNTItZTQwMC00MTk5LTkyZTYtYjdjMGNkMzBkZjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk0MTdmNTItZTQwMC00MTk5LTkyZTYtYjdjMGNkMzBkZjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000741/","name":"Tim Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000101/","name":"Dan Aykroyd"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005387/","name":"Joe Roth"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125564/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001300/","name":"John Grisham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The head goblin is kind of scarry looking; but not too bad.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92245,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-03-26","keywords":"gryphon,competition,boy,dancing,father figure","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Spiderwick Chronicles","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498204953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Spiderwick Chronicles Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092961/","name":"Sarah Bolger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914132/","name":"Mark Waters"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456732/","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1183854/","name":"David Berenbaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000626/","name":"John Sayles"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is assisted by his resourceful valet, who is not British and along the way wins the heart of a fair maiden and finds true love as well as the successful completion of his wager.\n\nKnowing that Mr. Coraci is the film maker who gave us The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy will give some idea of the level of humor involved in most scenes. Further confidence will not be gained from the writing trio's pat efforts, as one is making his feature film debut and another wrote for the sitcom Who's the Boss. The most obvious stamp on this production is made by star Jackie Chan, who is also and executive producer and stunt arranger on this film. \n\nMy young son has developed a taste for martial arts film after seeing a Bruce Lee movie on cable, so I have taken in a few of Mr. Chan's more recent efforts on DVD. Chan's American films are less serious than his Chinese language pictures, playing on Chan's ability to perform the most amazing physical feats along with his charming method of not acting. The action sequences are always astonishing, and Around the World serves up a superb sampling of what he can do, and do very well. The character Chan plays was a Frenchman in Verne's rendering, but the movie changes things in an almost plausible way to account for the obvious fact that Chan is not of that background.\n\nChanges are made in the main character as well. Steve Coogan plays Philieas Fogg, the Englishman who makes the wager and travels the globe to win it, and Coogan should learn from Chan's example the wisdom of being not only actor but producer. Though he plays what is arguably the main character in the story, Coogan is billed second, behind Chan in the film's credits. Coogan delivers a character that is far more 'obviously' eccentric that Verne may have imagined, and the script plays up some of this in making Fogg and mad inventor type who concocts outlandish-and ahead of their time-inventions that the scientific establishment will not embrace. I am ready to bet good money that the director or one of the screen writers was making a sort of homage to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang with this characterization of Fogg, since he comes across much like the genial mad scientist that Dick Van Dyke played in that film. \n\nSeeing this film reminded me of the affection that I have for a previous screen version, the one that starred David Niven as Fogg, in a masterful performance that seems to sum up the effete bravado that is a stereotypical British Gentleman. At one point of the circumnavigation while in India, Niven as Fogg is given what every Britisher needs in a warm clime, a pith helmet, but his has a sort of veil or ribbon that hangs down the back. It is an usual sartorial flourish that not every actor could carry off, because wearing a hat with a veil just looks girly on most guys, but Niven not only makes it work but makes it work for him. \n\nAny good adventure story, and this is one, needs a villain to hiss at, and Jim Broadbent has obvious fun as the blustering Lord Kelvin that he threatens to steal the show from some of the less raucous performers. Kathy Bates has a forcefully memorable cameo as Queen Victoria, and looks like the best screen Victoria in some time. Arnold Schwarzenegger shows up as Turkish prince and displays the acting prowess that indicate his continued occupancy of the Governor's office is a good thing for the art of cinema.\n\nAlthough the costumes don't give a clear definition of time period, they are handsome to look at, and there is a lot of good design work that has gone into this film. Each culture and geographic region is set off in contrast to the others we encounter, and the animated transitions between live action scenes are an effective and charming way to move along in style.\n\nMy bottom line: 2.5 out of 5 stars.

The story is about a man who is tasked with building an ark to save the innocent, from the cleansing of the world by a great flood. With a stellar cast of Russell Crowe (Noah), Jennifer Connelly (Naameh), Ray Winstone (Tubal-cain), Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Anthony Hopkins, and Nick Nolte, Noah truly had everything right to be an incredible movie. Unfortunately, the pacing of the third act falters and all the character development of the main cast is spiked up to the extreme, rendering them completely un-relatable. In the end, this is quite a forgettable movie that doesn't need to be seen from a purely movie quality perspective.\n\nFull Review:\n\nI feel that I should state this before I go any further – I do not affiliate myself with any religion, nor am I against religion. This review comes purely from someone who loves movies in general. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's move on with the review. In the movie, Noah (Russell Crowe) lives in a dark world that is corrupted by wickedness. He receives messages from the creator, showing him visions of a great flood that covers the whole world. Noah must now build an ark with his family to save the innocent (all wildlife other than mankind).\n\nI'll start off with some things that I did like about this movie. Normally Darren Aronofsky is known for tackling deeply personal stories that are more of a character study. It is nice to see him break from his norm and make a movie of a much grander scale, while still bringing his touch when it comes to developing his characters, especially with Noah. Russell Crowe should also be commended for his great performance. Just from his facial expression, you can tell how much burden he feels weighing on his shoulders. The world that is created is extremely well realized. The atmosphere is dark and drab, and you really feel the rotting air of the world. Overall the movie was captivating and well- paced  right up until the third act, after the flood scene.\n\nThird act is really where everything just falls apart. Now I won't spoil anything, for anyone who wants to watch the movie. Still I need to mention few things to explain why things go wrong for this movie. For some reason the whole cast makes a sudden shift from balanced and complex characters, to be completely driven and defined by their base instincts. So for example, Noah becomes completely blinded by his devotion and divine purpose that he almost becomes villainous. These changes in character comes so suddenly that it feels out of place. Also the movie comes to such a snail crawling pace that I felt the need to check my watch a few times.\n\nThis was a movie that had the potential to be a great character driven movie, set in an epic scale. It did show this promise for the most part in the beginning. However, a sudden change in tone and pacing issues ended up making it feel like it was dragging on. I say skip this movie, because even if you watch it, you will forget about it in a few days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-26","keywords":"old testament,supernatural power,family relationships,father son conflict,dysfunctional family","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi225552921","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the Biblical story, a man suffering visions of an apocalyptic deluge takes measures to protect his family a coming flood.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062935/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359504/","name":"Ari Handel"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story is about a man who is tasked with building an ark to save the innocent, from the cleansing of the world by a great flood. With a stellar cast of Russell Crowe (Noah), Jennifer Connelly (Naameh), Ray Winstone (Tubal-cain), Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Anthony Hopkins, and Nick Nolte, Noah truly had everything right to be an incredible movie. Unfortunately, the pacing of the third act falters and all the character development of the main cast is spiked up to the extreme, rendering them completely un-relatable. In the end, this is quite a forgettable movie that doesn't need to be seen from a purely movie quality perspective.\n\nFull Review:\n\nI feel that I should state this before I go any further – I do not affiliate myself with any religion, nor am I against religion. This review comes purely from someone who loves movies in general. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's move on with the review. In the movie, Noah (Russell Crowe) lives in a dark world that is corrupted by wickedness. He receives messages from the creator, showing him visions of a great flood that covers the whole world. Noah must now build an ark with his family to save the innocent (all wildlife other than mankind).\n\nI'll start off with some things that I did like about this movie. Normally Darren Aronofsky is known for tackling deeply personal stories that are more of a character study. It is nice to see him break from his norm and make a movie of a much grander scale, while still bringing his touch when it comes to developing his characters, especially with Noah. Russell Crowe should also be commended for his great performance. Just from his facial expression, you can tell how much burden he feels weighing on his shoulders. The world that is created is extremely well realized. The atmosphere is dark and drab, and you really feel the rotting air of the world. Overall the movie was captivating and well- paced  right up until the third act, after the flood scene.\n\nThird act is really where everything just falls apart. Now I won't spoil anything, for anyone who wants to watch the movie. Still I need to mention few things to explain why things go wrong for this movie. For some reason the whole cast makes a sudden shift from balanced and complex characters, to be completely driven and defined by their base instincts. So for example, Noah becomes completely blinded by his devotion and divine purpose that he almost becomes villainous. These changes in character comes so suddenly that it feels out of place. Also the movie comes to such a snail crawling pace that I felt the need to check my watch a few times.\n\nThis was a movie that had the potential to be a great character driven movie, set in an epic scale. It did show this promise for the most part in the beginning. However, a sudden change in tone and pacing issues ended up making it feel like it was dragging on. I say skip this movie, because even if you watch it, you will forget about it in a few days.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-26","keywords":"old testament,supernatural power,family relationships,father son conflict,dysfunctional family","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi225552921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the Biblical story, a man suffering visions of an apocalyptic deluge takes measures to protect his family a coming flood.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062935/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359504/","name":"Ari Handel"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.\n\nFirst of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan movies would lose all interest.\n\nI was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and surprising finale.

This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.\n\nFirst of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan movies would lose all interest.\n\nI was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and surprising finale. The direction is amazing and claustrophobic. The performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman.

Likely this has partially to do with Craig Brewer's personal interests and a lack of other interesting images to look at in a pointless remake of the Kevin Bacon "classic" (assuming you grew up in the 80's). The main drag on the film grows from the lack of a Kevin Bacon-level compelling talent among the cast. When Kenny Womald utters the iconic "let's dance" to the camera you could picture yourself opting to sit this one out instead. When Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father and town elder finally has his change of heart, it comes as no really emotional catharsis given Quaid's earnestness and track record as the good guy leading man. Now Randy Quaid would have made an interesting and likely challenging from a product standpoint casting choice. Julianne Hough plays Ariel as more sleazy than fun-loving and her dance moves do kind of make you agree to an extent with the Reverend. As always, Andie MacDowell brings her inexcusably flat line readings to a part that could have been cut from the film with little effect.

Likely this has partially to do with Craig Brewer's personal interests and a lack of other interesting images to look at in a pointless remake of the Kevin Bacon "classic" (assuming you grew up in the 80's). The main drag on the film grows from the lack of a Kevin Bacon-level compelling talent among the cast. When Kenny Womald utters the iconic "let's dance" to the camera you could picture yourself opting to sit this one out instead. When Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father and town elder finally has his change of heart, it comes as no really emotional catharsis given Quaid's earnestness and track record as the good guy leading man. Now Randy Quaid would have made an interesting and likely challenging from a product standpoint casting choice. Julianne Hough plays Ariel as more sleazy than fun-loving and her dance moves do kind of make you agree to an extent with the Reverend. As always, Andie MacDowell brings her inexcusably flat line readings to a part that could have been cut from the film with little effect. Everyone else in the film comes across as the indistinguishable chorus line from a traveling company version of the Footloose Musical. Having said all that, the movie brings some entertaining visuals although it someone screws up the soundtrack; the version of "Holding Out for a Hero" used her is a sacrilege of the original Bonnie Tyler version of the Jim Steinman song.

It Doesn't Deserve Walking Out On !","reviewBody":"In his famous TV show, (At The Movies), film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment!\n\nWhen an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't!\n\nThis is not a bad movie. The word "intolerable" got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel &amp; Hardy, yet in colors, and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working.\n\nThe actual problem was that this movie came after (Tommy Boy - 1995) which was a better movie. So the disappointment had to be powerful. And yes, you have to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..), the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better, or as good?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent.\n\nThe easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled, however on a poor level with not much to support it either. For instance: the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly. And for some, it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods!\n\nThough, (Black Sheep) isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine. I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy!! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised!), and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness, or repulsiveness, or bore.\n\nDear late Gene Siskel.. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. (Kingpin) and (The Cable Guy) are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad, one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic was being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, couldn't have a good time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1996-02-02","keywords":"clumsiness,embarrassment,political campaign,politics,crooked politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3586310425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","description":"A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000394/","name":"Chris Farley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005450/","name":"David Spade"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001513/","name":"Tim Matheson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790715/","name":"Penelope Spheeris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It isn't great and it isn't awful. Rogen's screenplay disappointed me, he did such a good job on Superbad. This movie will be compared to Superbad and rightfully so. It basically serves as a prelude to Superbad. Owen Wilson does his usual. Wilson's charm and improv skills keep this movie afloat. I think that if this movie was rated R it would have fared better with reviews and box office performance. Overall though its a must see for Frat Pack fans and Wilson fans. I also wish Owen well in his upcoming projects and i hope he is well on the road to recovery.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":59590,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-05-14","keywords":"nickname in title,woman wears a bikini,embarrassing male nudity,name in title,male name in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Drillbit Taylor","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1454506265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODYzMzk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU0NzQ1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODYzMzk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU0NzQ1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Drillbit Taylor Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0669681/","name":"Josh Peck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1372713/","name":"Alex Frost"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0109359/","name":"Steven Brill"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003249/","name":"Kristofor Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Another forgettable movie that will someday fade away. 4/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11306,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-01-10","keywords":"airplane,pilot,shootout,stewardess,fear","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3820273689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRiODM4NGQtY2Y1Ni00MzJlLThlMDAtNmE2ZTkyM2JjNzA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRiODM4NGQtY2Y1Ni00MzJlLThlMDAtNmE2ZTkyM2JjNzA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After a shootout on a flight transporting prisoners, a flight attendant must outwit a smooth-talking serial killer and land the plane herself.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000501/","name":"Ray Liotta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000452/","name":"Lauren Holly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322407/","name":"Brendan Gleeson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125111/","name":"Robert Butler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030480/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107954/","name":"Jonathan Brett"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Fortunately, I didn't get my hopes up, and therefore I wasn't disappointed. The movie has its fair share of flaws, don't get me wrong. However, the movie made this Saw fan happy because it maintained the spirit of the series. The movie's biggest flaw is that it is by far the most unrealistic of the series and relies too much on chance within the story. Too many events are contingent on others, which makes Jigsaw look almost clairvoyant. However, I was able to look past this and enjoy the fourth Saw film.\n\nJigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead. Though he is gone, he vows that his work will continue. And it appears he is true to his word, for SWAT Lt. Rigg (from Saw 2 &amp; 3) is the latest member of the police force to be thrust into one of Jigsaw's deadly games. Meanwhile, Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is joined by a pair of FBI agents to help stop the Jigsaw killer once and for all...They'll start by looking into his past, beginning with his ex wife, Jill.\n\nThe acting is pretty good. Costas Mandylor, Tobin Bell, and Scott Patterson are the standouts. Bell brings so much more to the character this time around through flashbacks as we learn more about John Kramer. Showing that he has created one of the most memorable characters of recent memory, Bell makes us almost sympathize with him, despite the acts he has committed. Mandylor is really good as Detective Hoffman, even though he has limited screen time and dialog. I liked Patterson a lot because of the toughness and reality he brought to the character. Agent Strahm is a good character and definitely one of my favorites in the series. One big surprise was Lyric Bent as Rigg. He definitely showed a lot of range in this movie. He has a future.\n\nThe plot is probably the most complex, as there can be as many as 3 different subplots going on at the same time, all while the audience has questions from the first 3 movies answered. The ending also leaves a little to be desired, as it is the least impacting twist of the series (and most obvious). However, I really enjoyed the traps, which were definitely a step up from Saw 3. The random gore was kept to a minimum, but the beginning is absolutely horrifyingly gory. It also felt rushed, which means I can't wait to see the unrated DVD. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others. Saw 4 has the weakest script of the series, but it's still better than I expected. At this point, it appears as if Darren Bousman is going through the motions, and that's what keeps the series spirit alive. As long as Bousman, Wan, or Whannell continue to be involved, the spirit should live on. I also have to give props to the editor for the smooth and catchy transitions, not to mention the production design is top notch. That and the lighting provide at least some horror realism, as the plot does border on absurd at times. The sound is better than ever, with the classic 'Hello, Zepp' tune that has become one of the most recognizable tracks in movie history making its dramatic appearance in the climax of the film. The ending also leaves us wanting more, so I'm expecting Saw 5 next Halloween.\n\n8/10 --spy","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145953,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-11-21","keywords":"serial rapist,ex wife,tied to a chair,bound and gagged,brutality","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saw IV Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3031499033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI4MjgzNjI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI4MjgzNjI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Saw IV Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068551/","name":"Tobin Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666398/","name":"Scott Patterson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274371/","name":"Louis Ferreira"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1135423/","name":"Darren Lynn Bousman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137447/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0184201/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0786360/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733317/","name":"Patrick Melton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729303/","name":"Marcus Dunstan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272090/","name":"Thomas Fenton"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It wasn't terrible, but not much happens.  It didn't entertain me. Isabel goes to Paris to visit her pregnant sister, Roxanne.  Upon arriving, she sees Roxanne's husband leaving her.  So, she tries to cheer her sister up and has an affair with a married relative of the husband.  He buys her an expensive purse and everyone knows they're hooking up.  A side plot involves a painting that belongs to Roxanne's family.  She doesn't want her husband to get it in the divorce. They decide to sell it and find out it's worth millions.  So, now the 2 sisters have some money to start the new chapter in their lives.\n\nI don't think it was a romance film and it sure wasn't funny. I would describe it as bland.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:  It may put you to sleep, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you are suffering from insomnia.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11286,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-08-29","keywords":"american,french,love,sex,france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Le Divorce","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1636958489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000330/","name":"Stockard Channing"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055367/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424956/","name":"Diane Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695609/","name":"Ruth Prawer Jhabvala","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"Passengers" is not a movie I would strongly recommend but the shocking finale and some good acting performances make a decent (barely decent actually) choice for an evening rental.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Mystery","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-09-26","keywords":"airplane crash,survivor,explosion,afterlife,doctor patient relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Passengers: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3525836825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Passengers, directed by Rodrigo GarcÃ­a.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001556/","name":"David Morse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006554/","name":"Rodrigo García"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142446/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123049/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159892/","name":"Ronnie Christensen"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

An old-fashioned cop emerges to foil a high-tech attack on the country's computer infrastructure as Bruce Willis brings back one of the biggest action franchises in screen history. It is one of my personal favorite action movies, it is a sequel I love to death.\n\nIt's been over a decade since audiences last saw New York cop John McClane (Willis), but now, as the world's greatest criminal mastermind (Timothy Olyphant) attempts to cripple the entire country with an innovative act of technological terrorism, only one cop can insure that the integrity of the system stays intact. In this, the fourth installment of the long-running action series, Underworld director Len Wiseman picks up the torch formerly carried by directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin to helm a script penned by Mark Bomback. \n\nBest Action Film Of 2007. Even with ratings PG-13 this film works for me. Those four movies of the franchise are the ones I love. When a criminal plot is in place to take down the entire computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the United States (and the world), it's up to a decidedly "old school" hero, police detective John McClane, to take down the conspiracy, aided by a young hacker.Well, I can't believe I'm saying this but the newest edition to the Die Hard series may rank with the first. It's superb direction, fantastic acting, groundbreaking special effects and clever scenes, will leave you with (almost) nothing to complain about. Die Hard may very well be the best action flick of 2007. It can be beat, but I doubt by a sequel. I am proud to say that Bruce Willis still has some John McClane left in him. Bruce gets to say one of most famous lines in action film history, "Yippy Ki-ya Motha ******!", without cuts, he even gets to talk to himself, a scene that is almost identical to the scene in the air vent of the first film. (C'mon, it'll be fun, come out to the coast, have a few laughs.) About all the controversy for the MPAA rating...it was all useless. Die Hard acts just like a rated R film, just because it says PG-13 doesn't mean its not as violent as the others. No, he doesn't say the F word, but it's not as bad as you think. It's more of a character to character type of thing then anything else. John McClane learns to bond with a young hacker. (Justin Long) It's more...I don't know..."cute" then the other movies, it doesn't need the F word. I don't think there is much else to say. Die Hard is one of my best movie experiences to date. The crowd laughed and screamed and then cheered at the end. The only slightest problem I had with this film was the fact that the realism was quite low. Then again, as I have said before, if everything were realistic we wouldn't have action movies. \n\nLive Free or Die Hard is a must-see FOR DIE HARD FANS.\n\nLive Free or Die Hard (also known as Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard or simply Die Hard 4 and released as Die Hard 4.0 outside North America) is a 2007 American action film, and the fourth installment in the Die Hard film series. The film was directed by Len Wiseman and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The film's name was adapted from New Hampshire's state motto, "Live Free or Die".\n\nI loved the fact it's still Die Hard especially in the Unrated cut. the PG-13 didn't bother me he still told jokes, put a smile on my face gave his tagline &amp; killed the bad guy. But my favorite scene is the Car Chase with the Chooper if I had to pick one. An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety. That said, it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didn't have to deal with it. Bruce Willis should not be the victim of facile stereotyping. He brings more heart and humor to apocalyptic pulp fiction than any other actor I can think of offhand. \n\nThat film is great and the last good Die Hard film, A Good Day To Die Hard sucks horrible. Live Free or Die Hard is my favorite fourth film in the Die Hard franchise and this film, filmed in 2007 was great. 9/10 Score: A+","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":397293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-27","keywords":"hacker,hacking,cyber terrorist,computer hacker,john mcclane character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Live Free or Die Hard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2534908953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwYzEzY2EtOTQ0NS00YzQxLWE2NzctMTg3Njc5YzU1NzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwYzEzY2EtOTQ0NS00YzQxLWE2NzctMTg3Njc5YzU1NzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Live Free or Die Hard"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0648249/","name":"Timothy Olyphant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936482/","name":"Len Wiseman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985343/","name":"John Carlin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0861636/","name":"Roderick Thorp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Live Free or Die Hard is my favorite fourth film in the Die Hard franchise and this film, filmed in 2007 was great. 9/10 Score: A+","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":397293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-27","keywords":"hacker,hacking,cyber terrorist,computer hacker,john mcclane character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Live Free or Die Hard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2534908953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwYzEzY2EtOTQ0NS00YzQxLWE2NzctMTg3Njc5YzU1NzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwYzEzY2EtOTQ0NS00YzQxLWE2NzctMTg3Njc5YzU1NzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Live Free or Die Hard","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0648249/","name":"Timothy Olyphant"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936482/","name":"Len Wiseman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985343/","name":"John Carlin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0861636/","name":"Roderick Thorp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

These two are meant to be top notch Secret Service agents in their late 20s for heaven's sake, not Buffy extras.\n\nI can only assume the writing team has changed, or the producers are aiming at a younger/less demanding demographic. Whatever is going on - I certainly won't be tuning in to see the rest of S4 if it carries on like this.\n\nWhat a pity.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50056,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-07-07","keywords":"occult detective,supernatural power,artifact,steampunk,shared universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565858/","name":"Eddie McClintock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162399/","name":"Joanne Kelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007210/","name":"Saul Rubinek"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260870/","name":"Jane Espenson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609315/","name":"D.
