    <title lang="pl">ABC Agathy Christie</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Rok 1933. Emerytowany belgijski detektyw Herkules Poirot (John Malkovich) stara się wytropić wyrafinowanego seryjnego zabójcę, który wysyła tajemnicze listy podpisane "ABC". Śledczy musi je rozszyfrować, aby odkryć tożsamość niebezpiecznego przestępcy. Wspiera go inspektor Crome (Rubert Grint). Trzymająca w napięciu adaptacja prozy mistrzyni gatunku - Agathy Christie - z nominowanym w karierze dwukrotnie do Oscara ("Miejsca w sercu", "Na linii ognia") Johnem Malkovichem.</desc>

    <title lang="pl">ABC Agathy Christie</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Rok 1933. Emerytowany belgijski detektyw Herkules Poirot (John Malkovich) stara się wytropić wyrafinowanego seryjnego zabójcę, który wysyła tajemnicze listy podpisane "ABC". Śledczy musi je rozszyfrować, aby odkryć tożsamość niebezpiecznego przestępcy. Wspiera go inspektor Crome (Rubert Grint). Trzymająca w napięciu adaptacja prozy mistrzyni gatunku - Agathy Christie - z nominowanym w karierze dwukrotnie do Oscara ("Miejsca w sercu", "Na linii ognia") Johnem Malkovichem.</desc>

Overflowing with intensity and hyperkinetic camerawork, this is a frightening roller-coaster ride of a film; despite clocking in at less than 90 minutes, "Pi" is by no means short on resonance - but rather leaves a heavy feeling of exuberance and fascination with the material that lasts long after it's finished.

It was written and directed by Michal Rosa.\n\nThe movie is set in 1939 in an apartment house in Silesia--an area of Poland close to the German border. The apartment house itself is unusual. It's clearly not far from a city, but it sits in lonely isolation in a field. It's a very upscale place, and most of the people who live in it are middle or upper class. It's not what we in the U.S. would call a tenement, with poor people making ends meet. It's very elegant.\n\nThe plot centers around a journalist from a large city who is sent to the area to track down an elusive bestselling author. This search is more or less just a way to begin the story. When the reporter arrives, his first meeting is with the beautiful Róza, portrayed by Karolina Gruszka. \n\nRóza has many charms, which she openly displays to the reporter, as well as to any other man who joins her. In turn, director Rosa openly displays Gruszka's charms to his audience. We can all see why she's called "The Happiness of the World."\n\nThe movie plot is actually a series of vignettes. Each inhabitant of the apartment building has her or his own story. To a certain extent, the stories intersect, because all of the characters live in the same place. The pivotal figure in all of this is Róza. Karolina Gruszka isn't just another pretty face. She's an extraordinary actor, who is well known in Poland. The movie will rise or fall depending on Gruszka's presence on the screen. She's great, and the film rises accordingly.\n\nWe watched this movie in Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work well on the small screen. The film was shown at the outstanding 2017 Rochester Polish Film Festival. After the film, director Rosa was in attendance for a Q&amp;A session. (He doesn't speak English, but the interpreter who worked with him was superb.) My compliments to the PFF for bringing the director to Rochester.\n\nFor me, the most striking aspect of the Q&amp;A was Mr. Rosa's discussion of magical realism. I believe that everyone in the audience noted magical realism in the movie. Director Rosa says that it isn't magical realism--it's just realism. I'm not sure if he was joking with us when he said that, or whether he actually believes that the type of events he shows us aren't magical at all. You'll have to watch the movie to see what you think about this realism.\n\nP.S. The Happiness of the World has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.3. It's a much, much better movie than that. Again, you'll have to watch the movie and then decide for yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-12-23","keywords":"silesia,bathtub,femme fatale","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344734/","name":"Karolina Gruszka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8475166/","name":"Mateusz Lickindorf"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2707614/","name":"Grzegorz Palkowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577510/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The stripes were only used during the invasion of Berlin. * Three Tiger tanks were lined up abreast with maybe a meter between them. In fact two looked like their treads were touching they were so close together. * The editing made it look like one Sherman Easy Eight took out a Tiger with a frontal shot * The Sherman and the tiger were both in the open and maybe 50 meters apart at best.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":880,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.3,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"2014-11-11","keywords":"soldier,u.s. soldier,world war two soldier,military,20th century","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067192/","name":"Tom Stedham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1387894/","name":"Bill Voorhees","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1559935/","name":"Tino Struckmann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0493295/","name":"Joseph J.

A small film crew is doing a ride- along with the fire department to get a first hand look at what their daily professional lives are really like. The film is presented the film crew's unedited stock footage, so we get lots of video of the firemen acting not at all like firemen but instead like young men who are living in close quarters for long periods of time. Finally an interesting call comes in and the crew are called out to a building in town. \n\nUp to this point, the movie is presented in a style even more realistic than a documentary, because the footage that we see is not even edited. Once they arrive at the building, of course, weird things start happening.\n\nYou know the premise, the movie is essentially a zombie movie, but a lot of the suspense and tension is predicated on the fact that this group of innocent people have been for some reason barricaded inside a building by the police, government, military, whatever. Soon we find out that it's the Center For Disease Control doing the quarantining, but the point is, the people that are meant to protect us are locking these innocent people inside a building and leaving them for dead and the people inside have no idea why.\n\nBut here's my first question, how do you lock an entire modern fire crew inside an old, dilapidated building presumably made primarily of plaster and wood? Later they discover that approaching windows is enough to get yourself shot, but after what happened soon after they arrived at the building, I am willing to bet that none of those guys would have been willing to spend more than two or three minutes locked unwillingly inside the building.\n\nNext, it seems that breaking through plaster walls is not the only bit of standard fireman training that these guys are lacking. When people start getting hurt, at one point one of the firemen calls out, "Is there a doctor in the house?" I had been under the impression that in order to be a fireman you have to have some emergency medical treatment training, but I could be wrong. I had to do the training in order to be a summer camp counselor a couple years ago, but maybe sleep-away camps are just stricter than your typical major city fire department.\n\nJennifer Carpenter is the lead character, the host of the documentary that the film crew was making. You may remember her from The Exorcism of Emily Rose, the astonishingly scary horror film that she starred in back in 2004. Sadly, Quarantine just doesn't have the story or the content to give her much to do except run around looking scared. Her performance as Emily Rose was one of the best horror performances I've ever seen, but Quarantine just gives the feeling that she's waiting for an opportunity or a good reason to do some real horror acting.\n\nOverall the movie is not bad, but it is overwhelmingly casual in its presentation of a typical horror movie, this time with the slight variation that all of the victims are trapped in close quarters with the zombies. They have zombies trying to get them inside the building, and humans on the outside pointing guns at the building to prevent any escape and outbreak of the virus causing the zombiness.\n\nThere is an interesting scene where the cameraguy actually uses the camera to bludgeon one of the zombies to death, which provides a unique point of view. I had never seen a zombie killed in a movie like that before, but other than that there is just not much special about the movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-07","keywords":"found footage,apartment building,trapped,virus,quarantine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quarantine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3133276441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAzMDM1Njg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk0OTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAzMDM1Njg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk0OTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Quarantine - Theatrical Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1358539/","name":"Jennifer Carpenter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004996/","name":"Steve Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1551922/","name":"Columbus Short"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235719/","name":"John Erick Dowdle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245483/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235719/","name":"John Erick Dowdle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1803105/","name":"Drew Dowdle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0049371/","name":"Jaume Balagueró"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A small film crew is doing a ride- along with the fire department to get a first hand look at what their daily professional lives are really like. The film is presented the film crew's unedited stock footage, so we get lots of video of the firemen acting not at all like firemen but instead like young men who are living in close quarters for long periods of time. Finally an interesting call comes in and the crew are called out to a building in town. \n\nUp to this point, the movie is presented in a style even more realistic than a documentary, because the footage that we see is not even edited. Once they arrive at the building, of course, weird things start happening.\n\nYou know the premise, the movie is essentially a zombie movie, but a lot of the suspense and tension is predicated on the fact that this group of innocent people have been for some reason barricaded inside a building by the police, government, military, whatever. Soon we find out that it's the Center For Disease Control doing the quarantining, but the point is, the people that are meant to protect us are locking these innocent people inside a building and leaving them for dead and the people inside have no idea why.\n\nBut here's my first question, how do you lock an entire modern fire crew inside an old, dilapidated building presumably made primarily of plaster and wood? Later they discover that approaching windows is enough to get yourself shot, but after what happened soon after they arrived at the building, I am willing to bet that none of those guys would have been willing to spend more than two or three minutes locked unwillingly inside the building.\n\nNext, it seems that breaking through plaster walls is not the only bit of standard fireman training that these guys are lacking. When people start getting hurt, at one point one of the firemen calls out, "Is there a doctor in the house?" I had been under the impression that in order to be a fireman you have to have some emergency medical treatment training, but I could be wrong. I had to do the training in order to be a summer camp counselor a couple years ago, but maybe sleep-away camps are just stricter than your typical major city fire department.\n\nJennifer Carpenter is the lead character, the host of the documentary that the film crew was making. You may remember her from The Exorcism of Emily Rose, the astonishingly scary horror film that she starred in back in 2004. Sadly, Quarantine just doesn't have the story or the content to give her much to do except run around looking scared. Her performance as Emily Rose was one of the best horror performances I've ever seen, but Quarantine just gives the feeling that she's waiting for an opportunity or a good reason to do some real horror acting.\n\nOverall the movie is not bad, but it is overwhelmingly casual in its presentation of a typical horror movie, this time with the slight variation that all of the victims are trapped in close quarters with the zombies. They have zombies trying to get them inside the building, and humans on the outside pointing guns at the building to prevent any escape and outbreak of the virus causing the zombiness.\n\nThere is an interesting scene where the cameraguy actually uses the camera to bludgeon one of the zombies to death, which provides a unique point of view. I had never seen a zombie killed in a movie like that before, but other than that there is just not much special about the movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-07","keywords":"found footage,apartment building,trapped,virus,quarantine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quarantine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3133276441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAzMDM1Njg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk0OTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAzMDM1Njg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk0OTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Quarantine - Theatrical Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1358539/","name":"Jennifer Carpenter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004996/","name":"Steve Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1551922/","name":"Columbus Short"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235719/","name":"John Erick Dowdle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245483/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235719/","name":"John Erick Dowdle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1803105/","name":"Drew Dowdle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0049371/","name":"Jaume Balagueró"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Having it be directed by Albert Pyun - a well known b-movie auteur - didn't exactly raise my hopes. I mean how many Albert Pyun flicks rank that highly? Yeah, exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles.\n\nIt all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on. It runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat. I don't know what Pyun was going for here. I mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a blur at times and maybe I'm an idiot for expecting more from Pyun this time around. Here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted.

Having it be directed by Albert Pyun - a well known b-movie auteur - didn't exactly raise my hopes. I mean how many Albert Pyun flicks rank that highly? Yeah, exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles.\n\nIt all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on. It runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat. I don't know what Pyun was going for here. I mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a blur at times and maybe I'm an idiot for expecting more from Pyun this time around. Here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. Crazy Six isn't much of an action film, it's not much of anything really.\n\nI guess what's the saddest here is the fact that I found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie.

Sword-and-sorcery saga with silly action , spectacular images and fantastic scenes with witchcraft and necromancy . This is a tale of fantasy , magic , imagination, blood and wizardly set in a mythical primitive world of barbarisms. This is an amusing adventure saga inspired on Robert E Howard's pulp tale , it stars Brigitte Nielsen ( by that time married Silvester Stallone) who join forces with the mythic and valiant warrior Kalifor ( a super-swordsman Arnold Schwarznegger in a brief guest spot), a Hyborian Age hero , a Conan-alike , taking on heinous forces of devil and evil minions . A nasty sorceress kills the keeper (Janet Agren) of a powerful green bulb that gives her great power , but Red Sonja is sister of the keeper and seeks vengeance on villainess Gedren who also massacred her family . A selfish little boy prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his underling Falkon (Paul L. Smith), whose kingdom was wiped out by Gedren soon joins them .

Our heroine fights the evil hoodlums of brutal Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) who seeks the total power and leading a vibrant ending.\n\nThis exciting film packs noisy action, fantasy, adventure, witchery , and rip-roaring fights . Dumb images , unintentionally hilarious and lots of amusement and entertainment . Made on a fairly big scale with spectacular set design and glimmer photography . Quite budget for an Italian/Netherland/US co-production and lavishly produced by Dino De Laurentiis , her daughter Francesca and Jose Lopez Rodero. This entertaining picture contains frenetic action , tension , necromancy, and moving action scenes . The film is full of freaks and bemusing situations ; it is quite entertaining because being a laborious and intriguing adventure tale with some humor . Colorful cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno , Federico Fellini's usual . Very derivative special effects , grand production design by Danilo Donati ,and matte paintings by Albert Whitlock and Emilio Ruiz del Rio . Impressive musical score composed and conducted by the master Ennio Morricone. The motion picture is middling directed by Richard Fleischer . He's an expert director , with adventure classics (Vikings, 20.000 leagues under sea) and noir cinema (Narrow margin,Clay pigeons,Trapped). The film will appeal to fantasy buffs with enough action to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Conan enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because thrills, action and adventures are brilliantly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact. Rating : 5,5 ; it's an old-fashioned B film on an acceptable scale and basically enjoyable because of it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40215,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1985-07-03","keywords":"female nudity,sword and sorcery,redheaded woman,hyborian age,cult film","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Red Sonja","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2683485977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1ZmZmMjItNjk3ZS00MGFiLTgyMjQtYjFiYzlhNzViNzhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1ZmZmMjItNjk3ZS00MGFiLTgyMjQtYjFiYzlhNzViNzhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000557/","name":"Brigitte Nielsen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000922/","name":"Sandahl Bergman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281507/","name":"Richard Fleischer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036611/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0397574/","name":"Robert E.

Hulk (2003) has some aspects I like such as the three lead characters, the villain is meh, the Hulk scenes are pretty cool and it does have some interesting ideas. But this film is very slow paced, filled with pretty wooden dialogue and is too drama heavy rather than fueling us comic book fans with more action.

Not in the fist!","reviewBody":"Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!\n\nFatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.\n\nI remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.\n\nThe stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very naïve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.\n\nOther stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.\n\nThe bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree, considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives, I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves, but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid, then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.\n\nThe Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel, most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything, yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone, that fighting is the last option for any situation, whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true, as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties, again this movie shows this to be so true.\n\nIn conclusion, the Karate Kid is a truly great film, but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate, as it is a very Chinese practice, but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches, that is for self-defence, and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie, because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story, but not to matter, if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option, then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!\n\nCMRS gives 'The Karate Kid': 5 (Brilliant Film)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1984-06-22","keywords":"karate,teenager,training,martial arts,bonsai","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Karate Kid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi813087257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001552/","name":"Pat Morita"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

Not in the fist!","reviewBody":"Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!\n\nFatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.\n\nI remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.\n\nThe stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very naïve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.\n\nOther stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.\n\nThe bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree, considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives, I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves, but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid, then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.\n\nThe Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel, most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything, yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone, that fighting is the last option for any situation, whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true, as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties, again this movie shows this to be so true.\n\nIn conclusion, the Karate Kid is a truly great film, but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate, as it is a very Chinese practice, but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches, that is for self-defence, and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie, because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story, but not to matter, if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option, then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!\n\nCMRS gives 'The Karate Kid': 5 (Brilliant Film)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1984-06-22","keywords":"karate,teenager,training,martial arts,bonsai","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Karate Kid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi813087257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001552/","name":"Pat Morita"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

It has been called "plodding," "stale," and "uninspired," thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....\n\nFirst, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.\n\nHaving said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.\n\nIf you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called "overly-long exposition" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.\n\nCritics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.\n\nI think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.\n\nIn short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the "truth", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.\n\nIf you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.\n\nThe bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.\n\nMy advice: go see for yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":414398,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"self flagellation,conspiracy,bare butt male,self punishment,bound and gagged","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Da Vinci Code","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2369847833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this conspiracy thriller starring Tom Hanks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124737/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467010/","name":"Dan Brown"}],"duration":"PT2H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.\n\nI think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.\n\nIn short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the "truth", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.\n\nIf you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.\n\nThe bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.\n\nMy advice: go see for yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":414398,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"self flagellation,conspiracy,bare butt male,self punishment,bound and gagged","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Da Vinci Code","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2369847833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this conspiracy thriller starring Tom Hanks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124737/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467010/","name":"Dan Brown"],"duration":"PT2H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In Florence, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) awakens in a hospital with no memory of the last two days and with daydreams and dreadful visions.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun! This is entertainment, after all. My rating: 7 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-23","keywords":"character name as series title,surname as series title,one word series title,2010s,reboot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1395771/","name":"Lucas Till","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1159702/","name":"Tristin Mays","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2058713/","name":"Justin Hires"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0504531/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0957453/","name":"Lee David Zlotoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006997/","name":"Peter M.

I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism.

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).\n\nEveryone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.\n\nLike Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.\n\nWhen it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough.

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).\n\nEveryone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.\n\nLike Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.\n\nWhen it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better "Snatch".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":810515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-09-01","keywords":"diamond,boxer,narrated by character,fight,cockney accent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Snatch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1558577433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334318/","name":"Stephen Graham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).\n\nEveryone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.\n\nLike Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.\n\nWhen it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better "Snatch".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":810515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-09-01","keywords":"diamond,boxer,narrated by character,fight,cockney accent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Snatch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1558577433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334318/","name":"Stephen Graham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Absolutely no comparison. This is the most realistic show about a SF unit that I have seen.

Over the past few years we've had a plethora of books made into movies like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent and Twilight along with their sequels. As long as they make money at the box office, Hollywood shall continue to make them. Another adaptation in the long line of young adult fiction is The 5th Wave which starts off promisingly but then becomes another generic teenage film with a romance subplot and unconvincing action scenes.\n\nCassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is just a normal teenage girl living happily in Ohio with her father (Ron Livingston), mother (Maggie Siff) and brother, Sam (Zackary Arthur). Their lives change when aliens invade Earth. The aliens inflict wave after wave of attack: the 1st wave refers to electromagnetic pulses being disabled resulting in a loss of communication and transportation; the 2nd wave is a flurry of natural disasters; the 3rd wave is an airborne deadly virus transmitted by birds; the 4th wave is the alien species inhabiting humans like parasites; the 5th wave is alien domination. The adults are separated from the children and the US army led by Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) is taking control of the situation, placing children in quarantine so they can assist in fighting the alien species. Cassie finds herself isolated from her peers and must fight her own battles.\n\nThe plot is tense and exciting but that's just for the first half an hour. Once the children have been separated from the adults, things become a bit stale. It doesn't help when there's sizable plot holes throughout the movie. The story then drifts off into a romantic subplot which was just as boring as the Twilight series. When the children are trained to fight the aliens, there's a sense that all excitement has dissipated. If the focus was on Cassie fighting her own battles and trying to find her brother then it would have made for a more exciting movie.\n\nThe director is J Blakeson and this is his second directorial effort after The Disappearance of Alice Creed in 2009. It might be another seven years until he is employed again for he has some learning to do. Some of those close-up shots of the actors with their foreheads not in the frame were annoying and several of the fight scenes were difficult to see as they were filmed in natural lighting at night!\n\nChloe Grace Moretz is developing into a terrific actress if she hasn't reached that level already. She is convincing as the teenager who must make her own decisions when her family is no longer around to support her. The two actors who play her love interests, Nick Robinson and Alex Roe, are both devilishly handsome but their roles could be played by any young, unknown Hollywood heartthrob. Liev Schreiber adds integrity to the production and can always be relied upon to hold the fort in the acting stakes.\n\nThere are quite a few clever ideas in this film but the execution could have been much better. If you're a fan of young adult fiction, you won't be too disappointed but for people who have seen many movies, there's nothing new which will cause you to leap for joy. The story sticks pretty much to the generic formula and doesn't reach any great heights. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-01-22","keywords":"based on young adult novel,alien,male objectification,invasion,kiss","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726226201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four waves of increasingly deadly attacks have left most of Earth decimated.

He's one of top 5 best actor of our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it was, but not that great.\n\nWhat he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with the wonderful director.\n\nIt was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts, but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.\n\nI think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a weird person, so you would easily get it. You must need to be a patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for Gyllenhaal alone. I can't say it should have been better, because there's nothing to get better, everything was at its best.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94236,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-04-08","keywords":"father in law,death of wife,father in law son in law relationship,car accident,widower","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1256437017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk0ODIzNDQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTI5NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk0ODIzNDQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTI5NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal), a successful investment banker, struggles after losing his wife in a tragic car crash.

He's one of top 5 best actor of our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it was, but not that great.\n\nWhat he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with the wonderful director.\n\nIt was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts, but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.\n\nI think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a weird person, so you would easily get it. You must need to be a patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for Gyllenhaal alone. I can't say it should have been better, because there's nothing to get better, everything was at its best.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94236,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-04-08","keywords":"father in law,death of wife,father in law son in law relationship,car accident,widower","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1256437017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk0ODIzNDQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTI5NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk0ODIzNDQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTI5NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal), a successful investment banker, struggles after losing his wife in a tragic car crash.

It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment.

Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic.

Written by Hannah Marks and Joey Power\n\n I figured a change of pace was needed after the wild and seemingly noxious events of the day. Banana Split is a comedy about a girl who becomes best friends with the girl dating her ex boyfriend. They don't just become rather hey how are ya nice to see you friends. They become best friends who would die for each other. This becomes a problem because they're both in love with the same guy. Dylan Sprouse looking more like a cover of a romance novel than when I remember him running around causing all kinds of shenanigans in the hotel.\n\nNormally this is not the kind of movie I seek out. Hell I don't think I'm even the target demographic for this type of story. That doesn't always mean you won't get something out of stories about people different than yourself. This tale of female friendship definitely managed to wiggle its way into my consciousness.\n\nThis tale of friendship is genuine. We all understand jealousy. We all understand the hurt of seeing your ex, who you might still harbor feelings for, in the arms of another. We all understand not being able to help who you click with. It happens. It used to happen more to me. I'm good now. I'm also getting off topic.\n\nThis movie moves like a bullet and you are attached to these relationships in a matter of minutes. It makes great use of a montage to show the progression of a relationship. You completely experience the relationship of Hannah Marks and Dylan Sprouse from beginning to a painful end. If you had a relationship in high school, then this will feel achingly familiar.\n\nYou will also find yourself wrapped up in the good times of Hannah Marks and Liana Liberato(From the recent Beach House). They know they shouldn't be friends and they are pushing back against it at first but the attraction can not be denied in the long run. It is delightful and fun.\n\nThis movie will hit you from the beginning. This flick will play with your emotions even when you don't want it to and you might want to appear stoic and stone cold. It's better if you're not. It's better to laugh along with the antics. This is a very funny film. I loved all the performances in it. Nobody is the bad guy. This movie uses the genuine conflict that comes from competing emotions and hormones. I enjoyed the humanity of that. I give this movie a B.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","keywords":"dating,teen movie,female vomiting,vomiting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537261081","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMGRkMmItYzZhNC00OTIwLWE4MmYtMjE5NTlmNDE5YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMGRkMmItYzZhNC00OTIwLWE4MmYtMjE5NTlmNDE5YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"April (Hannah Marks) has spent the last two years of high school in a relationship with Nick (Dylan Sprouse), from first make-out session to a final tear-stained breakup.

If you had a relationship in high school, then this will feel achingly familiar.\n\nYou will also find yourself wrapped up in the good times of Hannah Marks and Liana Liberato(From the recent Beach House). They know they shouldn't be friends and they are pushing back against it at first but the attraction can not be denied in the long run. It is delightful and fun.\n\nThis movie will hit you from the beginning. This flick will play with your emotions even when you don't want it to and you might want to appear stoic and stone cold. It's better if you're not. It's better to laugh along with the antics. This is a very funny film. I loved all the performances in it. Nobody is the bad guy. This movie uses the genuine conflict that comes from competing emotions and hormones. I enjoyed the humanity of that. I give this movie a B.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","keywords":"dating,teen movie,female vomiting,vomiting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537261081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMGRkMmItYzZhNC00OTIwLWE4MmYtMjE5NTlmNDE5YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMGRkMmItYzZhNC00OTIwLWE4MmYtMjE5NTlmNDE5YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"April (Hannah Marks) has spent the last two years of high school in a relationship with Nick (Dylan Sprouse), from first make-out session to a final tear-stained breakup.

During that time she became an elected Labour MP and Minister of State for Transport.\n\nIt is easy to dismiss this as a drama of an old woman with advancing dementia. Elizabeth is Missing shares somewhat with Christopher Nolan's Memento. Maud is suffering from dementia. The missing memories means she has no idea as to what has happened to her friend Elizabeth.\n\nMaud's search for Elizabeth also unlocks deeply buried memories of another mystery in Maud's past.

During that time she became an elected Labour MP and Minister of State for Transport.\n\nIt is easy to dismiss this as a drama of an old woman with advancing dementia. Elizabeth is Missing shares somewhat with Christopher Nolan's Memento. Maud is suffering from dementia. The missing memories means she has no idea as to what has happened to her friend Elizabeth.\n\nMaud's search for Elizabeth also unlocks deeply buried memories of another mystery in Maud's past. That of her older sister who has been missing since 1949.\n\nAs the drama goes on, I sort of guessed what may have happened to Elizabeth. Maud's behaviour such as her constant gardening leads to a more interesting story.\n\nJackson claims that she understood the devastation of dementia from the old people's homes she visited during her time as a politician.

World War II. Baseball. Spies. A true story. Assemble all those pieces and you have Morris "Moe" Berg. Director Ben Lewin (THE SESSIONS, 2012) brings the fascinating story to the big screen with Robert Rodat's (Oscar nominated for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) screenplay adapted from the 1994 biography "The Catcher was a Spy: The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg" written by Nicholas Dawidoff. This is neither your typical spy movie nor your typical baseball movie. \n\nBackground information is provided by pre-movie title cards: in 1938 German scientists split the atom for the first time, ushering in the nuclear age; renowned German physicist Werner Heisenberg (1932 Nobel Prize winner) was charged with building an atom bomb; the United States responded by sending a baseball player to assassinate him. It's 1944 Zurich and two men exchange uncomfortable glances across a dimly lit room. \n\nWe then flashback 8 years to see Moe Berg utilizing his gut instincts to survive as a veteran journeyman catcher for the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. We later learn his sixth sense is not limited to the baseball diamond, and is used in situations much more important than whether a baserunner is stealing a base. Growing up Jewish, Berg had always been somewhat of an outsider, admitting, "I don't fit in." In baseball, they called him a walking enigma. Educated at Princeton, Columbia and Sorbonne in Paris, Berg spoke several languages, had a 'fake' wife, was a regular on quiz shows, and was constantly followed by insinuations of homosexuality ... though he only admitted to being good at keeping secrets.\n\nBerg's is a truly fascinating story, but unfortunately Paul Rudd is a bit overmatched in the lead role. He just doesn't quite have the dramatic acting chops to convey the intellectual depth of the man. However, the rest of the cast is stellar: Paul Giamatti (as Samuel Goudsmit), Connie Nielsen, Mark Strong (Heisenberg), Sienna Miller, Hiroyuki Sanada, Guy Pearce, Jeff Daniels (as William J Donovan), Tom Wilkinson (as Paul Scherrer), Giancarlo Giannini (a 50+ year career), and Shea Whigham (as Joe Cronin). Many of these are little more than cameos, and the choppy feel of the film's flow prevents us from ever really connecting to characters. \n\nAn extended battle scene volleys from intense and well-filmed to slightly comical as Mr. Giamatti is forced to run and dodge bullets. The look, tone and color palette of the film is quite similar to Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES (another true story), though this current one pales in comparison, as director Lewin presents it as a "will he won't he kill the guy?" scenario. Berg's story is likely more suited to documentary treatment, as his time with the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS, later the CIA), resulted in his being awarded the Medal of Freedom.

I saw Palimpsest at the Toronto International Film Festival, and the director's comments after the screening about how the screenplay changed during development and how he hates unnecessary dialog were interesting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"police inspector,murder,husband wife relationship,doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162123/","name":"Magdalena Cielecka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327290/","name":"Robert Gonera"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1407454/","name":"Konrad Niewolski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067099/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023778/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107013/","name":"Igor Brejdygant"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Zieja</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

Hard for either side of the stale debate to shout unfair.\n\nI enjoyed the ride but felt like I could have done with more of a rollercoaster. I felt it remained a little safe. It didn't spoil the film but prevented a higher rating.\n\nThe final act was an interesting take on the story. You could call it a twist. And the message did hit home. But I am sick to death of knowing this message and yet still NOTHING gets done to fix things. But back to the film...\n\nThis is an enjoyable film with laughs and a serious message. Worth watching just for the scene near the end where the cake is eaten on the bed. Made me laugh. I recommend this film. I recommend it to the LEFT and the RIGHT.

An entertaining film with enough giggles in. A lovely cast of very fine actors. Well written and well directed.\n\nThis was always going to be a left leaning film until you then realise it isn't. Hard for either side of the stale debate to shout unfair.\n\nI enjoyed the ride but felt like I could have done with more of a rollercoaster. I felt it remained a little safe. It didn't spoil the film but prevented a higher rating.\n\nThe final act was an interesting take on the story. You could call it a twist. And the message did hit home. But I am sick to death of knowing this message and yet still NOTHING gets done to fix things. But back to the film...\n\nThis is an enjoyable film with laughs and a serious message. Worth watching just for the scene near the end where the cake is eaten on the bed. Made me laugh. I recommend this film. I recommend it to the LEFT and the RIGHT. To people who still Want to care...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15835,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-06-26","keywords":"political satire,american politics,election campaign,rural america,marine veteran","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Irresistible - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4096179737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVkN2UxZTgtMmZiYi00OWM0LThjMjYtOTEyMDViOTg4YjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVkN2UxZTgtMmZiYi00OWM0LThjMjYtOTEyMDViOTg4YjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177933/","name":"Chris Cooper"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829537/","name":"Jon Stewart"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136967/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829537/","name":"Jon Stewart"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie unnecessary tries to tell something about anti-Semitism , betrayal and courage of freedom fighters. For more than half of the movie is hard to tell that this is comedy . When the so-called jokes appear in the second half of the movie they so awful you will groan. The movie also feels too long (it's 2 hours long ) , which wasn't a problem in the first movie (which was almost 3 hours long) . Gone is the charm and the fun of original.\n\nThe acting is good and the music is very jolly . Still , it's too little to save the movie from being a disaster. I give it 1/10.

This one is supposed to be a war comedy about stealing gold from Nazi's.\n\nIt was supposed to be comedy . Unfortunately the movie takes itself way too seriously . The movie unnecessary tries to tell something about anti-Semitism , betrayal and courage of freedom fighters. For more than half of the movie is hard to tell that this is comedy . When the so-called jokes appear in the second half of the movie they so awful you will groan. The movie also feels too long (it's 2 hours long ) , which wasn't a problem in the first movie (which was almost 3 hours long) . Gone is the charm and the fun of original.\n\nThe acting is good and the music is very jolly . Still , it's too little to save the movie from being a disaster. I give it 1/10. Better watch "Kelly's heroes". Or the original – "HK Deserters".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"genre":["Action","Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"1998-12-04","keywords":"1940s,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464945/","name":"Marek Kondrat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0511277/","name":"Boguslaw Linda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953975/","name":"Wiktor Zborowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538105/","name":"Janusz Majewski"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538105/","name":"Janusz Majewski"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you.

I walked in expecting the worst, but the first 20 minutes genuinely gripped me and even made me jump once. As the film continues, it mostly becomes a Dr. Loomis vs. Michael Myers storyline with Omar Epps' frazzled detective trying to make sense of how a seemingly normal teenage male could survive a few gunshots and a fall off a hospital roof and still continue to kill people every Halloween for a number of years. Could it be a copycat killer? You'll have to stick with Trick to find out and, once you do, you'll most likely be let down.\n\nWhile most of the film plays out like a supernatural-tinged slasher, the last 15 minutes of the movie, where the film finally reveals what's really been going on, is likely to inspire many groans and rolling eyes. There's a piece of an interesting idea in there, but it's not as well-executed as it could have been. There's a final twist at the end that's really a groaner and makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe acting is at least passable for most of the film and it's nice to see genre icon Tom Atkins getting something to do every now and then. It also might be one of the better of the recent "the corpses in this haunted house are real" movies that seem to be coming out all the time. There's some good suspense here and there, too, so Trick is far from a complete waste of time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-10-18","keywords":"halloween,splatter,slasher,gore,bloody","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1954987801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On Halloween night in 2015, Patrick "Trick" Weaver massacred his classmates at a costume party.

I walked in expecting the worst, but the first 20 minutes genuinely gripped me and even made me jump once. As the film continues, it mostly becomes a Dr. Loomis vs. Michael Myers storyline with Omar Epps' frazzled detective trying to make sense of how a seemingly normal teenage male could survive a few gunshots and a fall off a hospital roof and still continue to kill people every Halloween for a number of years. Could it be a copycat killer? You'll have to stick with Trick to find out and, once you do, you'll most likely be let down.\n\nWhile most of the film plays out like a supernatural-tinged slasher, the last 15 minutes of the movie, where the film finally reveals what's really been going on, is likely to inspire many groans and rolling eyes. There's a piece of an interesting idea in there, but it's not as well-executed as it could have been. There's a final twist at the end that's really a groaner and makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe acting is at least passable for most of the film and it's nice to see genre icon Tom Atkins getting something to do every now and then. It also might be one of the better of the recent "the corpses in this haunted house are real" movies that seem to be coming out all the time. There's some good suspense here and there, too, so Trick is far from a complete waste of time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-10-18","keywords":"halloween,splatter,slasher,gore,bloody","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1954987801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On Halloween night in 2015, Patrick "Trick" Weaver massacred his classmates at a costume party.

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic.

Despite her aggressive happiness, her home life is dysfunctional. Her mother is depressed after the death of Candice's baby sister three years earlier. Her father is angry at his rich brother whom he believes to have stolen his great idea. New kid Douglas Benson believes that he's from another dimension and falls for Candice right away. Their wonky-eyed teacher assigns the class project Life as an Alphabet.\n\nThis is cute. I don't recognize any of the actors although Emma Booth seems familiar. The kids are newcomers.

They all say this, we all know that, when in fact, truth is always the simplest if not the easiest of answers. Here Robert Redford is not trying to be Oliver Stone. No, he remains Robert Redford in his handsome rugged way asking us to think without ever even asking it. He provokes the question in a situation that we all seem to have taken sides. I admired the seriousness of the intention here. Meryl Streep is terrific interviewing an inedited Tom Cruise - All the recent gossip about Cruise made his Senator even more sinister. Redford, the all American guy, guides according his own coordinates but doesn't preach. He just tells us. Well done!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48797,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-11-07","keywords":"infrared,the white house,woman wears eyeglasses,mgm,student","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lions For Lambs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1540162329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGI0ZjAyODYtMjM4NC00Yjc2LTlmYTgtN2VmMmQzNGUwMzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGI0ZjAyODYtMjM4NC00Yjc2LTlmYTgtN2VmMmQzNGUwMzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"The second trailer for the drama film about the connection between U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, a senator, a reporter and a college professor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034515/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1996352/","name":"Matthew Michael Carnahan"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's clear seasons and time are passing in a dizzying, almost disorientating, fashion so when people finally appear, (an elderly man and his granddaughter), they feel as if they shouldn't be here and when we move indoors, it's like a alien place, particularly as there is a horse in the living room. And then it's back to more of the same, images of a landscape, but now with people occasionally appearing at a distance..\n\nIn part an intimate psychological study of its central character, Ingimundur, (a superb, award-winning performance from Ingvar Sigurdsson), and in part a study of the harsh environment in which he lives, Palmason's film is a visually stunning and often relentless 'thriller', dealing with the themes of grief, jealousy and revenge. It's also the kind of film that clearly belongs in the Northern Hemisphere where nature at its least forgiving determines both the landscape and the character of its inhabitants. You could say Ingimundur is the way he is becasue of his environment.\n\nThe plot evolves slowly yet inexorably with dialogue kept to a minimum. As a thriller it reminded me of the television series "True Detective" which certainly took its time and wasn't really concerned with resolving issues; the pace here is decidedly languorous and the film is open-ended. A huge hit on the festival circuit and the Icelandic entry for the Oscars, it should also prove very popular with art-house audiences.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-09-06","keywords":"female frontal nudity,male nudity,female nudity,male rear nudity,male frontal nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A White, White Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi306495257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjBjZDI5MjktZTFlOC00MjJkLWI1ZGEtOTAwODZlNWY4NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjBjZDI5MjktZTFlOC00MjJkLWI1ZGEtOTAwODZlNWY4NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797614/","name":"Ingvar Sigurdsson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10588371/","name":"Ída Mekkín Hlynsdóttir"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350273/","name":"Hilmir Snær Guðnason"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6249843/","name":"Hlynur Pálmason"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0404626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035146/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001935/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6249843/","name":"Hlynur Pálmason"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's clear seasons and time are passing in a dizzying, almost disorientating, fashion so when people finally appear, (an elderly man and his granddaughter), they feel as if they shouldn't be here and when we move indoors, it's like a alien place, particularly as there is a horse in the living room. And then it's back to more of the same, images of a landscape, but now with people occasionally appearing at a distance..\n\nIn part an intimate psychological study of its central character, Ingimundur, (a superb, award-winning performance from Ingvar Sigurdsson), and in part a study of the harsh environment in which he lives, Palmason's film is a visually stunning and often relentless 'thriller', dealing with the themes of grief, jealousy and revenge. It's also the kind of film that clearly belongs in the Northern Hemisphere where nature at its least forgiving determines both the landscape and the character of its inhabitants. You could say Ingimundur is the way he is becasue of his environment.\n\nThe plot evolves slowly yet inexorably with dialogue kept to a minimum. As a thriller it reminded me of the television series "True Detective" which certainly took its time and wasn't really concerned with resolving issues; the pace here is decidedly languorous and the film is open-ended. A huge hit on the festival circuit and the Icelandic entry for the Oscars, it should also prove very popular with art-house audiences.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-09-06","keywords":"female frontal nudity,male nudity,female nudity,male rear nudity,male frontal nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A White, White Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi306495257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjBjZDI5MjktZTFlOC00MjJkLWI1ZGEtOTAwODZlNWY4NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjBjZDI5MjktZTFlOC00MjJkLWI1ZGEtOTAwODZlNWY4NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797614/","name":"Ingvar Sigurdsson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10588371/","name":"Ída Mekkín Hlynsdóttir","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350273/","name":"Hilmir Snær Guðnason"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6249843/","name":"Hlynur Pálmason"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0404626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035146/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001935/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6249843/","name":"Hlynur Pálmason"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is just turning 18 and as such will be emancipated. But how prepared is a barely educated 18-yr-old to jump right into adult life?\n\nThis story is about that difficulty and the eventual trouble he finds himself in. It is hard to find a real purpose for this movie other than to tell an interesting fictional story but one which may be close to reality for some in a similar situation.\n\nMy wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library, however she abandoned it when things got a bit weird in the middle of the movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":832,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-22","keywords":"love,foster care,orphan,abandonment issues,emancipation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Friday's Child","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2967650073","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyZGEyYzYtN2IxYi00YTgwLTlmN2EtYzhlNmExMGQ5MmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyZGEyYzYtN2IxYi00YTgwLTlmN2EtYzhlNmExMGQ5MmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446467/","name":"Tye Sheridan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1782299/","name":"Imogen Poots"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2655177/","name":"Caleb Landry Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2270935/","name":"A.J.

It is mostly set in Waco, Texas and mostly shot there. I recognized some of the areas from my several visits a few years back. They even have a scene of throwing tortillas off the Waco Suspension Bridge, a ritual most Baylor college students go through.\n\nTexas native Tye Sheridan is the main character, Richie, an orphan who has banged around the foster system for most of his life. He is just turning 18 and as such will be emancipated. But how prepared is a barely educated 18-yr-old to jump right into adult life?\n\nThis story is about that difficulty and the eventual trouble he finds himself in. It is hard to find a real purpose for this movie other than to tell an interesting fictional story but one which may be close to reality for some in a similar situation.\n\nMy wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library, however she abandoned it when things got a bit weird in the middle of the movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":832,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-22","keywords":"love,foster care,orphan,abandonment issues,emancipation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Friday's Child","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2967650073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyZGEyYzYtN2IxYi00YTgwLTlmN2EtYzhlNmExMGQ5MmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyZGEyYzYtN2IxYi00YTgwLTlmN2EtYzhlNmExMGQ5MmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446467/","name":"Tye Sheridan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1782299/","name":"Imogen Poots","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2655177/","name":"Caleb Landry Jones"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2270935/","name":"A.J.

In fact, it's a sure sign of cancellation how much I like this show. I never like crime shows. My mom loves them, but I find them dull, because they're about plots not characters. This is a crime show about characters (not as good as "The Closer" -- the crime show I adored this summer -- mind you), and I enjoyed it. At times, it seemed far-fetched, and the whole Senator plot-point in the pilot seemed awful easy, but the dialogue worked, the characters intrigue me, and the chemistry is great. I expect good things from it.\n\nAlison","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-09-13","keywords":"forensic anthropologist,investigation,washington d.c.,crime scene investigation,murder investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0221043/","name":"Emily Deschanel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004770/","name":"David Boreanaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174819/","name":"Michaela Conlin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0212869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0361274/","name":"Hart Hanson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bones: The Complete Seventh Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi748140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bones: The Complete Seventh Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I expect good things from it.\n\nAlison"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-09-13","keywords":"forensic anthropologist,investigation,washington d.c.,crime scene investigation,murder investigation","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0221043/","name":"Emily Deschanel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004770/","name":"David Boreanaz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174819/","name":"Michaela Conlin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0212869/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0361274/","name":"Hart Hanson"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bones: The Complete Seventh Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi748140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bones: The Complete Seventh Season"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That is great comic writing.\n\nIt also has one of the best endings of any movies out there. For some reason, contemporary films are having a terribly difficult time with coming up with a satisfactory ending. Not "Mr. Bean's Vacation."

This seemed to be the case for the first couple of minutes of narrative monologue before the jokes started coming fast and furious. This turned out to be a highly entertaining comedy/buddy film couched in a tongue in cheek film noir setting. The dialogue was witty and the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmour was great. Some of the jokes went by so fast that I'll have to see this movie again to see what I missed as I was still laughing at the previous one.

This seemed to be the case for the first couple of minutes of narrative monologue before the jokes started coming fast and furious. This turned out to be a highly entertaining comedy/buddy film couched in a tongue in cheek film noir setting. The dialogue was witty and the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmour was great. Some of the jokes went by so fast that I'll have to see this movie again to see what I missed as I was still laughing at the previous one. The director spoke before the movie and commented on how the producers were nervous about the risky choice of actors.

I really enjoyed this movie. The humour was light hearted and the story line was good. It's a rom-com without being too chick flicky with the story line and humour type. I found it genuinely funny and with good characters. I'm not a fan of most rom coms as I often find the humour to be too corny or over the top. This wasn't the case.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

The cast was mostly unknown to me, but the talent in the two leads (British actress Ruth Wilson and actor Andrew Scott) is undeniable. As to the subject matter of the movie (the Oslo Accords), with each passing year, one appreciates all the more the significant risks that were taken by the negotiators, and that real progress was made, only to see it all fall apart after the Oslo Accords were signed (in September, 1993). And look where the Israelis and Palestinians are now almost 30 years later. Nothing has been solved, and things are a LOT worse now than in the early 90s.

If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Knowing that Id recommend this for anyone looking to watch a great movie","reviewBody":"Ya RomComs are something I avoid at all costs. Theyre always the same and never ever anything that would play out in real life so why give you or your partner unrealistic expectations watching something that is just going to set you up for failure.. This movie SPONTANOUSly turned out to be something completely unexpected - REALLY Good and really funny. The romance part is underplayed and mostly the setup as an after thought for the perfectly timed witty one liners that are delivered spot on with real chemistry you can feel between the main actors. The movie is just a take on the traditional coming of age story and how everything when youre young seems like the end or the beginning of the world and with each death of a young persons dream life its never the end but just the transition to another dream of how life will play out..

Theyre always the same and never ever anything that would play out in real life so why give you or your partner unrealistic expectations watching something that is just going to set you up for failure.. This movie SPONTANOUSly turned out to be something completely unexpected - REALLY Good and really funny. The romance part is underplayed and mostly the setup as an after thought for the perfectly timed witty one liners that are delivered spot on with real chemistry you can feel between the main actors. The movie is just a take on the traditional coming of age story and how everything when youre young seems like the end or the beginning of the world and with each death of a young persons dream life its never the end but just the transition to another dream of how life will play out..

The movie is directed by Tony Award-winning director Bartlett Sher, now venturing out into the movies. When reviewing a movie like this, it is not easy but nevertheless necessary to separate the merits of the movie from the merits of the subject matter of the movie. As to the movie itself, I was surprised how engaged I found myself with the movie. I have not seen the underlying theater play, but the sequencing and pacing of the movie is simply outstanding. The cast was mostly unknown to me, but the talent in the two leads (British actress Ruth Wilson and actor Andrew Scott) is undeniable. As to the subject matter of the movie (the Oslo Accords), with each passing year, one appreciates all the more the significant risks that were taken by the negotiators, and that real progress was made, only to see it all fall apart after the Oslo Accords were signed (in September, 1993). And look where the Israelis and Palestinians are now almost 30 years later. Nothing has been solved, and things are a LOT worse now than in the early 90s. Frankly, it's anyone's guess whether the Israeli-Palestine conflict can ever be solved at this point. And so the killings go on. There are several scenes in the movie that were hopeful, when the opposing negotiators saw each others as HUMANS, not just as Israeli or Palestine. It filled my eyes with tears, knowing that these historical moments went for naught in the end. (For another take on this, make sure to check out the 2017 documentary "The Oslo Diaries", equally worth seeking out.)\n\n"Oslo" premiered on HBO a few days ago, and is now available on HBO On Demand (where I saw it tonight), HBO Max, and Amazon Instant Video.

If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While the familiar formula still works as inspiring as ever, it is mainly good ol' Rock that steals the protagonist's spotlight. Without Sly's solid rock performance this movie would have been just another fight movie. And although the Creed saga reaches new hights in storytelling, we must admit that Adonis just isn't as charismatic as Rocky or as his dad, Apollo. This time he can't even step out of his opponent's shadow, who has a far more compelling story to tell than the one Adonis brings.

While the familiar formula still works as inspiring as ever, it is mainly good ol' Rock that steals the protagonist's spotlight. Without Sly's solid rock performance this movie would have been just another fight movie. And although the Creed saga reaches new hights in storytelling, we must admit that Adonis just isn't as charismatic as Rocky or as his dad, Apollo. This time he can't even step out of his opponent's shadow, who has a far more compelling story to tell than the one Adonis brings. So, this might not be the fight of the century but there is certainly some rumbling in the jungle.

But will it be enough to fill the void, heal the deep wounds of his past, and set him on the road to redemption?","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1371339/","name":"Al Madrigal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1232470/","name":"Janina Gavankar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0640334/","name":"Gavin O'Connor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309252/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0706942/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2145487/","name":"Brad Ingelsby"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are a handful of genuinely funny moments, which is quite a rich haul for Hollywood comedies these days, and a refreshing resistance to the temptation to insert major gross-out gags. Despite a few cynical expletives and near the knuckle jokes, this one would probably appeal to fans of comedies from Hollywood's vintage era.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-09-19","keywords":"slipping and falling,dog walking,new york city,ghost,medical mask","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ghost Town: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3501196057","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bertram Pincus, is a man whose people skills leave much to be desired.

Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.\n\nZootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":457928,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-03","keywords":"anthropomorphic animal,con artist,rabbit,police,mammal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi934327577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the animal city of Zootopia, a fast-talking fox who's trying to make it big goes on the run when he's framed for a crime he didn't commit.

Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.\n\nZootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":457928,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-03","keywords":"anthropomorphic animal,con artist,rabbit,police,mammal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi934327577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the animal city of Zootopia, a fast-talking fox who's trying to make it big goes on the run when he's framed for a crime he didn't commit.

I am male, mid sixties, and have watched, like many others, all the great (and not-so-great) horror films. After watching the ten episodes of 'The Handmaid's Tale' I can safely say that THIS is a real horror story. It makes the entire horror genre seem like cotton candy. After each episode I find myself shaking, often with tears in my eyes. I'm not going to talk about the story. I am going to tell you that the acting is beyond reproach.

Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music.

As the movie opens, we see kids taking the stage, bringing inspirational quotes, original poems, tributes, etc. After that quick introduction, we step back and learn what the event, not in its 40th year, means for the 120 public schools in the Oakland school district, and how engaged the students become in the run-up to the oratorical fest. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from veteran documentararian Amy Schatz, who just last year brought us the excellent "In the Shadow of the Towers: Stuyvesant High on 9/11". Here Schatz lets us take a glimpse at the impact of the annual MLK oratorical fest has on the Oakland public school students. While the fest runs K through 12, the film mostly looks at kids ages 9-11, and none more so than 9 yr. old Gregory Payton, whose public speaking skills will blow you away, even at that young age. The film s mostly inspiring and I was awed with the efforts put in by these young kids all around. However, in full disclosure, there was one scene that I cannot understand. A teacher in Markham Elementary is prepping his class for the oratorical fest: "Who are we? we asks. "We are Black Panthers", the class answers in unison. "I can't hear ya, WHO ARE WE?" "WE ARE BLACK PANTHERS!" the class screams. "Show me some angry face!" the teacher instructs. Say what?!?

As the movie opens, we see kids taking the stage, bringing inspirational quotes, original poems, tributes, etc. After that quick introduction, we step back and learn what the event, not in its 40th year, means for the 120 public schools in the Oakland school district, and how engaged the students become in the run-up to the oratorical fest. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from veteran documentararian Amy Schatz, who just last year brought us the excellent "In the Shadow of the Towers: Stuyvesant High on 9/11". Here Schatz lets us take a glimpse at the impact of the annual MLK oratorical fest has on the Oakland public school students. While the fest runs K through 12, the film mostly looks at kids ages 9-11, and none more so than 9 yr. old Gregory Payton, whose public speaking skills will blow you away, even at that young age. The film s mostly inspiring and I was awed with the efforts put in by these young kids all around. However, in full disclosure, there was one scene that I cannot understand. A teacher in Markham Elementary is prepping his class for the oratorical fest: "Who are we? we asks. "We are Black Panthers", the class answers in unison. "I can't hear ya, WHO ARE WE?" "WE ARE BLACK PANTHERS!" the class screams. "Show me some angry face!" the teacher instructs. Say what?!? I couldn't believe how this teacher is indoctrinating these young kids with Black Panthers stuff. Much better is the scene where the Superintendent of the Oakland School District sums up what this even is all about: "It's about the power of his (MLK's) words, but it's also the power of their (the kids') words."\n\n"We Are the Dream" premiered last month on HBO during Black History Month, and I finally had a chance to catch it on HBO on Demand.

And the really gorgeous setting, which looks so much like either Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket you'd swear it was. But in fact the utterly incredible house was built for the movie on a sandy island in northern Germany called Sylt. Most of the movie, in fact, was shot in Germany, including Berlin (which was meant to be London), for the simple reason that the director, admitted sex offender Roman Polanski, couldn't travel to the U.S. without being arrested. There are a few driving scenes and scenic inserts that were filmed on Cape Cod (in the U.S.) without Polanski's presence.\n\nIt's interesting that Polanski wanted to make a film that had to be set here even though it made things difficult. Doubly so because his protagonists are all British, making weakly disguised references to Tony Blair (Pierce Brosnan doing a routine job--he really can't act worth beans if an actual emotion is required) and his wife (Olivia Williams, who is absolutely terrific, award material).\n\nWhich brings us back to McGregor, playing a ghost writer for the ex-prime minister's memoirs. He's really terrific at playing someone with savvy but also naiveté. He's smart but at first so trusting he gets into what is obviously a dubious job, his predecessor having just been killed. But we are lulled, too, until events internationally unravel the situation and he discovers some inside information. Of course, this puts him in more danger, and us in more suspense.\n\nIt's good, very good, but we have been here before. The details are different, but the intrigue is the same. Yes, we know about this shadow government where people are manipulated and assassinated while the news coverage is rose and contrived. Yes, we have seen the detemined innocent set out to prove the truth. Even the direct facts, that this young writer is going to rewrite his predecessor's apparently finished memoir, and then begins with the most basic interviews of the subject, don't shape up.\n\nYou'd never know this was directed by Polanski. Or would you? If you look at his earliest films you'll find some edgy, almost cruel quality ("Repulsion") but if you see "Chinatown" you'll actually have a parallel to this one--a well made film in a conventional container (that one has an amazing Jack Nicholson to lift it up). There is of course "Rosemary's Baby," which was lifted by a really creepy story. For "The Ghost Writer," Polanski's last film, you keep thinking there will be a real twist, something large and bizarre or just chilling, but it doesn't really happen. In fact, when the memoir gets published it's all a bit anti-climactic. \n\nAnd so, the final ten minutes, at a party, feels like a desperate attempt of the writer, and director, to make all this effort more than just another polished intrigue. At the last minute, a highly improbable final discovery occurs, followed by an even more improbable and shocking last ten seconds. Surprised, we sort of say, okay, I get it, and that's that.

The movie features surprisingly good acting all around, but Olesya Rulin steals the show!\n\nThe movie centers on a high school speed jumper who's dysfunctional family lets her down, and her desperate attempt to write the ship before it's too late.

It is very basic stuff and it never aspires to much. The characters are cut out of cardboard and the dialogue is awful, this might cut the mustard if the film was an out and out action film but it isn't.

I didn't think any of the races were exciting and although they are well done, all of them could have sorely used the emotions of the characters to feed into them. As it is the failure of the plot means that much of the film is lacking and feels rather pointless. Occasionally it hints at depth and humanity but the occasional spark is totally drowned out in a sea of noise. The music video goals of the film are met but personally I'm glad not to be in the demographic sector that is tricked into thinking that this makes for a good film.\n\nThe cast are mixed, containing people that I expected better from and people that deserve stuff like this. Fishburne may well have expected more from the film because at times you can see him reaching, sadly he cannot achieve the impossible and any glimmer of a good performance is swamped. Luke struggles from the start. He is pretty and charismatic here but he can't deliver emotion and understanding that isn't in the script and his narration is terrible. The support cast are roundly average with obvious performances from Jones, Hounsou, Fehr and others. Good is sexy but pretty vacant while I'm not sure why Bonet bothered to turn up for so little.\n\nOverall then a fairly pointless film that shrugs off any character potential it may have had in favour of MTV visuals, clunky dialogue and mostly average performances at best. You can see the potential in the story but across several aspects the film fails to deliver this potential and just churns out a totally unnecessary film that doesn't deserve any of your time."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-01-31","keywords":"motorcycle,african american,helmet,biker gang,rural setting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Biker Boyz","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1337590041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ZWIwZjYtZjdiOC00ZGEyLWE0NTktZDg2NTc4ZjVlZWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ZWIwZjYtZjdiOC00ZGEyLWE0NTktZDg2NTc4ZjVlZWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000401/","name":"Laurence Fishburne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1035682/","name":"Derek Luke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428963/","name":"Orlando Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090066/","name":"Reggie Rock Bythewood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1213025/","name":"Michael Gougis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272948/","name":"Craig Fernandez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090066/","name":"Reggie Rock Bythewood"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But Jenny has a secret.\n\nEverybody in the town knows G-Girl, who constantly manages to single-handedly keep New York City from trouble. Little does anybody know, G-Girl is really Jenny Johnson.\n\nWhen Matt introduces Jenny to his long-time work friend Hannah(Ana Faris), Jenny begins to act jealous and controlling, which leads to him dumping her. But that upsets her greatly, so she decides to get her revenge, using her powers to make his life a living hell.\n\nMy the final sequence, 'Girlfriend' gets out of control. But it's this refreshing, weird and funny premise that this summer needs. It's the perfect comedy to beat the summer heat.\n\nFor a film that is so silly, it's surprisingly well-executed.

If I didn't know better, it was a completely different race and certainly did not retain the beautiful features of Martin Lawrence and Nia Long. You would have thought that even film directors would get it right when it comes to matching families and siblings in films and TV. Bad decision in this film... so unrealistic and stupid!! The upside is that it made me laugh so much!! Overall, a fabulous film, but there were some silly errors.... Flaming hell,reviews are required to be 10 lines long... therefore, I am typing to my heart's content.... my opinion is to watch this film, but watch the first one if you haven't seen it, because it will help the setting...

It really peaks in the end where, disposing of the whole of the point, the heroes mess up their mission, utterly fail, leaving the world to its doom and walk away all smiles in search for another adventure and... warmer climates.\n\nReally, now, whoever gave high marks to this film must either be a close friend of someone in the cast or crew or an utter nutter about anything sword-yielding, magic-casting or horse-riding.\n\nAnd...

There is no real coherence from one scene to the next, no one takes advantage of the actors' strong points, long scenes to fill the time in order to give an excuse for a movie.\n\nThis could have been so much more.\n\nCG were not needed really; we could have used our imagination, with a bit of air acting, and use the money to hire a better director.\n\nAnd the story - oh, the story - what a mess... It really peaks in the end where, disposing of the whole of the point, the heroes mess up their mission, utterly fail, leaving the world to its doom and walk away all smiles in search for another adventure and... warmer climates.\n\nReally, now, whoever gave high marks to this film must either be a close friend of someone in the cast or crew or an utter nutter about anything sword-yielding, magic-casting or horse-riding.\n\nAnd...

I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.\n\nOne issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.\n\nIn general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).\n\nIt's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was "That's IT?!". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":455162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,reboot of series,scene during opening credits","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The show also seems bent on portraying the kids as mentally challenged too. Sure one of them has some tech savvy but, seriously... some of the 'mistakes' they made are 3rd grader nonsense, not high school. \n\nNot believable at all.

These were full of stories which, if not particularly literary, were full of action, color and plot. Later these moved to the movie serials and B movies, whence they were lifted, in the 1970s and 1980s, as the inspiration for movies like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, ROMANCING THE STONE and STAR WARS.

Remember, just take off your nostalgia glasses and enjoy for what it's worth.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22259,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-12-20","keywords":"high heels sharp toes,camera shot of a woman's feet in high heels,3d printer,cat burglar,roller suit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000329/","name":"Jackie Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795517/","name":"Shu Qi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4080670/","name":"Xingtong Yao"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000329/","name":"Jackie Chan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337825/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0561642/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0150894/","name":"Frankie Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000329/","name":"Jackie Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849282/","name":"Edward Tang"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Die ersten Befunde zeigen eindeutig, dass die Todesursache Strangulation gewesen sein muss. Doch Detective Dover und Asha finden keinerlei Hinweise auf Einwirkung von außen. Es scheint, als wäre Creighton ermordet worden, ohne vom Täter auch nur berührt worden zu sein. Syfy zeigt alle 10 Episoden von Halcyon in der Spielfilmfassung.</desc>
