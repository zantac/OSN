François Ozon, the director, had already impressed in 2003 with Swimming Pool, but In The House is probably his best film to date. It tells the story of a student that begins writing essays for his french teacher about one of his classmates' family, while he enters their house and makes himself a close friend.

Wnikliwie analizuje najważniejsze sceny z jego filmów, a także kluczowe wątki powtarzające się w całej twórczości autora dramatu "Siódma pieczęć". Von Trotta odnosi się także do miejsc ważnych dla biografii reżysera. W filmie głos zabierają również współpracownicy szwedzkiego mistrza oraz młodsze pokolenie filmowców, dla których dokonania Bergmana są stałym źródłem inspiracji.</desc>

At the end of the film, we still don't know whether Franky or Ballas should come out of the proverbial closet. And that makes "Giant Little Ones" a film that feels authentic. As in reality, some people need a lot of time to discover their sexual preferences. The only personage in this film who does this coming-out is Franky's father (a limited but defining role played by Kyle "Twin Peaks" MacLachlan). A situation that causes conflicting feelings for Franky. On the one hand, there is a love-hate relationship between him and his father. Its the opinion of Franky that Ray has disrupted the ideal family portrait and that he abandoned them. On the other hand, Franky starts to have doubts regarding his sexual orientation. There's the question of whether or not he has inherited genetic material from his father.\n\nThe whole fuss starts when Franky and Ballas go to bed and sleep there together after a hellish birthday party, during which excessive alcohol and probably other mind-altering drugs are consumed. Initially, it all looks like a perfectly normal idea. Two friends sleeping in the same bed. Although, they both are in a questionable state. And all this because the plans Franky had with his so-called girlfriend Priscilla, failed that evening. That's why they ended up together, instead of fooling around with their girlfriends. Anyway, it's abundantly clear that their friendship reached a completely different level that evening. Blurred images of someone tossing and turning plus one of the two fleeing the scene early in the morning, are both good indications to back this up. When afterward Ballas takes a distant demeanor (or even better, an aggressive, hostile attitude) and visibly doesn't want any contact with Franky anymore (and other fellow students as well.\n\nJosh Wiggins' acting is outstanding. A fresh young man who on the one hand effortlessly is invited to the club of popular boys and at the same time has an attitude as if this reputation doesn't really interest him. Darren Mann also played a convincing role and was the perfect choice to play the role of Ballas. He has a charisma that fits such a guy who makes peers' lives miserable because they are less fortunate when it comes to appearance and heritage. Such a kid who must uphold his reputation with his fellow confreres and therefor degrades himself to harassment and play that annoying tough-guy routine. And of course, such a person is idolized by members of the opposite sex who practice the same standards. Let's try and describe such a girl.

Not only these cartoonish fake persons with their derogatory and homophobic behavior are being presented here. But also those who stay true to themselves, are put in the spotlight. The message "Be yourself" is extensively displayed here. The hilarious lesbo Mouse (Niamh Wilson) in particular loudly proclaims this message by doing things the way she likes it.

Maybe it was a bit to cheesy for a true man I myself am, but I liked it nevertheless. Let me immediately point out what's the best this movie gives: it' chemistry between McDonnell (Sudeikis) and Hannah (Hall). They can be compared to Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni in The Family Man.\n\nStory itself is predictable. Hannah deals with loss and keeps being trapped in past when a NYC writer arrives and makes her confront herself. The rest I leave to your imagination.\n\nThere's a mindset one has to adopt in order to enjoy this movie. This is not about delivering story or even emotion (expect lots of them) - it's about little things which we usually take for granted and realize how important they are once they're gone. Little things which come to life only when somebody comes to our life. Little things we share together. Adopt this mindset and you're going to enjoy this movie as it may bring forth some memories.\n\nNow the soundtrack. Music is almost central to the movie. All the credits for soundtrack go to Damien Jurado. Search him - I'm sure you'll find it very relaxing and nice. His music really helps you to find and reflect upon some precious moments in the movie and in your own life. Since almost entire movie plays in a little, snowy town, movie really blends with the music.\n\nJason Sudeikis shows some acting skills! He's the main star of the movie - very entertaining and charismatic. Rebecca Hall was a cutie. Together they form a nice couple. Chemistry among them is what gives a reason for adopting mindset mentioned above.\n\nIt's never easy to "Turn the page and start a new chapter" as the tag line suggests. It's really not easy to do it only by yourself. I recall what C.S.Lewis once wrote: \n\n"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements.

 --- Description: Tumbledown: Directed by Sean Mewshaw. With Rebecca Hall, Jason Sudeikis, Joe Manganiello, Dianna Agron. A young woman struggles to move on with her life after the death of her husband, an acclaimed folk singer, when a brash New York writer forces her to confront her loss and the ambiguous circumstances of his death." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2338424/","name":"Tumbledown","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MzkwOTQ1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjcxMzg2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman struggles to move on with her life after the death of her husband, an acclaimed folk singer, when a brash New York writer forces her to confront her loss and the ambiguous circumstances of his death.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2338424/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"DVR_Brale","dateCreated":"2016-08-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"It's about little things which sprung only with somebody else","reviewBody":"This is a cute little movie! Maybe it was a bit to cheesy for a true man I myself am, but I liked it nevertheless. Let me immediately point out what's the best this movie gives: it' chemistry between McDonnell (Sudeikis) and Hannah (Hall). They can be compared to Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni in The Family Man.\n\nStory itself is predictable. Hannah deals with loss and keeps being trapped in past when a NYC writer arrives and makes her confront herself. The rest I leave to your imagination.\n\nThere's a mindset one has to adopt in order to enjoy this movie. This is not about delivering story or even emotion (expect lots of them) - it's about little things which we usually take for granted and realize how important they are once they're gone. Little things which come to life only when somebody comes to our life. Little things we share together. Adopt this mindset and you're going to enjoy this movie as it may bring forth some memories.\n\nNow the soundtrack. Music is almost central to the movie. All the credits for soundtrack go to Damien Jurado. Search him - I'm sure you'll find it very relaxing and nice. His music really helps you to find and reflect upon some precious moments in the movie and in your own life. Since almost entire movie plays in a little, snowy town, movie really blends with the music.\n\nJason Sudeikis shows some acting skills! He's the main star of the movie - very entertaining and charismatic. Rebecca Hall was a cutie. Together they form a nice couple. Chemistry among them is what gives a reason for adopting mindset mentioned above.\n\nIt's never easy to "Turn the page and start a new chapter" as the tag line suggests. It's really not easy to do it only by yourself. I recall what C.S.Lewis once wrote: \n\n"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable." \n\nIf you want to see this quote in motion, see this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2016-02-05","keywords":"singer songwriter,widow single man relationship,log cabin,boxer the dog,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2342696217","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTk3MDg0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ0MjU2NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTk3MDg0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ0MjU2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman struggles to move on with her life after the death of her husband, an acclaimed folk singer, when a brash New York writer forces her to confront her loss and the ambiguous circumstances of his death.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0356017/","name":"Rebecca Hall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0837177/","name":"Jason Sudeikis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001100/","name":"Blythe Danner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0582950/","name":"Sean Mewshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309252/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545944/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0534767/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0582950/","name":"Sean Mewshaw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1597917/","name":"Desi van Til"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The scene with Isabella modelling on the runway with her children is lame.\n\nThe scenes of the director with his mother were the most touching in the film and is what stays with me. There seems to be a warm close bond between them despite them not having seen each other for years. Those scenes were the most hopeful and intimate.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Documentary","Biography","History"],"datePublished":"2020-10-26","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1529407/","name":"Alessandro Rossellini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000618/","name":"Isabella Rossellini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744022/","name":"Renzo Rossellini"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1529407/","name":"Alessandro Rossellini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5030454/","name":"Lorenzo d'Amico de Carvalho"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258681/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066197/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312397/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3324087/","name":"Andrea Paolo Massara","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1529407/","name":"Alessandro Rossellini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3309810/","name":"Davis Simanis Jr."],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I do not understand French, nor the Dutch sub-titles. What I did was tried to search for sub-titles in English on the internet. Could not find one, so downloaded the sub-titles in Spanish, translated them to English and read the whole script of sub-titles before going for the movie. Surely it did not make much sense, but I depended on my memory to recollect the discussions between the painter and the gardener. Coming back home, I again re-read the sub-title script and recollected the images. That is how I saw and understood the movie. Though silly, that was the only and my way of doing enjoying this masterpiece.\n\nThe story is simple  a famous painter Dupinceau (Daniel Auteuil) is fed up with life in Paris and has decided to move back to his village home to paint. He hires a gardener Dujardin (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) who turns out to me school class mate. A whole lifetime has passed from where they started at school  remembering a prank the students played on their teacher's birthday cake. They share their journey of life with each other  through casual talks. The painter and gardener both experts in their fields are unique, in their perception of seeing things and understanding. Both of them become close friends  and with ailing health of gardener, the painter takes him to Paris for treatment. A few years later when the gardener dies, the painter fulfills his wishes by drawing the common things of his gardener's life  to capture those memories of happiness and joys.\n\nThe simplicity of plot and the depth of discussion is so appealing that one fills fulfilled by just listening the gardener and painter talk  you wish their talk would never end. This inspiring interest is created by Daniel and Jen-Pierre in living their roles perfectly on screen.\n\nSeventy year old Director Jean Becker, who has also partly written the story takes us through this varied journey of life's mysteries without letting us know that.\n\nThe innocent wittiness of gardener's amazement and questions posed to the painter are the highlight of the movie  that bring enlightenment of seeing things differently for painter and also for us.\n\nThe background musical score is spare, but wherever it is used, it is effective. There are a few sub-plots, but the movie does not digress from the main theme, and kudos to that track.\n\nThe most moving scene for me was when the two friends go for fishing, catch a big fish and then leave it back in the water alive and free again. Wonderful! There are so many dialogues in questions, answers and casual exchanges  that resonate with our souls. The last words of the gardener would ring in our hearts for years  I would like that you painted something that I liked. And in the end - the painter does  A classic, not to be missed  only recommended for those who are willing to know their souls (Stars 7.25 out fo 10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"gardener,divorce,vegetable,love,southern france","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000809/","name":"Daniel Auteuil"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201669/","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0182946/","name":"Fanny Cottençon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065449/","name":"Jean Becker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030118/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077414/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065449/","name":"Jean Becker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244089/","name":"Henri Cueco"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Could not find one, so downloaded the sub-titles in Spanish, translated them to English and read the whole script of sub-titles before going for the movie. Surely it did not make much sense, but I depended on my memory to recollect the discussions between the painter and the gardener. Coming back home, I again re-read the sub-title script and recollected the images. That is how I saw and understood the movie. Though silly, that was the only and my way of doing enjoying this masterpiece.\n\nThe story is simple  a famous painter Dupinceau (Daniel Auteuil) is fed up with life in Paris and has decided to move back to his village home to paint. He hires a gardener Dujardin (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) who turns out to me school class mate. A whole lifetime has passed from where they started at school  remembering a prank the students played on their teacher's birthday cake. They share their journey of life with each other  through casual talks. The painter and gardener both experts in their fields are unique, in their perception of seeing things and understanding. Both of them become close friends  and with ailing health of gardener, the painter takes him to Paris for treatment. A few years later when the gardener dies, the painter fulfills his wishes by drawing the common things of his gardener's life  to capture those memories of happiness and joys.\n\nThe simplicity of plot and the depth of discussion is so appealing that one fills fulfilled by just listening the gardener and painter talk  you wish their talk would never end. This inspiring interest is created by Daniel and Jen-Pierre in living their roles perfectly on screen.\n\nSeventy year old Director Jean Becker, who has also partly written the story takes us through this varied journey of life's mysteries without letting us know that.\n\nThe innocent wittiness of gardener's amazement and questions posed to the painter are the highlight of the movie  that bring enlightenment of seeing things differently for painter and also for us.\n\nThe background musical score is spare, but wherever it is used, it is effective. There are a few sub-plots, but the movie does not digress from the main theme, and kudos to that track.\n\nThe most moving scene for me was when the two friends go for fishing, catch a big fish and then leave it back in the water alive and free again. Wonderful! There are so many dialogues in questions, answers and casual exchanges  that resonate with our souls. The last words of the gardener would ring in our hearts for years  I would like that you painted something that I liked. And in the end - the painter does  A classic, not to be missed  only recommended for those who are willing to know their souls (Stars 7.25 out fo 10)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"gardener,divorce,vegetable,love,southern france","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000809/","name":"Daniel Auteuil","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201669/","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0182946/","name":"Fanny Cottençon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065449/","name":"Jean Becker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077414/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065449/","name":"Jean Becker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244089/","name":"Henri Cueco"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Since then, 'found footage' and 'handicam'-style films have become all the rage. There was the less-remembered 'Last Broadcast' which actually preceded Blair Witch but did not capture the imagination in the same way the viral marketing method pioneered by Haxan Films managed to. And since those early days, well-received efforts such as Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity have upped the budget but endeavoured to keep themselves to the same principles.\n\nSo, with these films now extremely common, it takes something a bit special to stand out. Sadly, nothing about 'A Night in the Woods' is special, and it blows several good chances to be a great film, instead ending up a bit of a mess of a production which could have been so much more.\n\nThe story sees 3 'friends' decide to go camping out in Dartmoor - the complete lack of explanation as to why they are going there is one mild flaw. A 'sinister' (contrived) element of risk is thrown in with a visit to an Irish pub and tales of horror from the area the intrepid 3 are aiming for.

Since then, 'found footage' and 'handicam'-style films have become all the rage. There was the less-remembered 'Last Broadcast' which actually preceded Blair Witch but did not capture the imagination in the same way the viral marketing method pioneered by Haxan Films managed to. And since those early days, well-received efforts such as Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity have upped the budget but endeavoured to keep themselves to the same principles.\n\nSo, with these films now extremely common, it takes something a bit special to stand out. Sadly, nothing about 'A Night in the Woods' is special, and it blows several good chances to be a great film, instead ending up a bit of a mess of a production which could have been so much more.\n\nThe story sees 3 'friends' decide to go camping out in Dartmoor - the complete lack of explanation as to why they are going there is one mild flaw. A 'sinister' (contrived) element of risk is thrown in with a visit to an Irish pub and tales of horror from the area the intrepid 3 are aiming for. And after a very long and dragged-out first portion of the movie we finally end up on location for a night in the woods.\n\nThis film tries insanely hard to be Blair Witch, in Britain.

She's out to kill a drugs lord, who indirectly caused her husband to die. She wants to blow him to bits, but her bomb ends up killing four innocents. Now she merely wants to finish her revenge. but imprisoned she'll need help. Enter young guard, Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi).\n\nHmm. you see once you've got the plot. the movie doesn't go anywhere. It's a thriller/revenge story. and then it tries to morph into a love story. It's aimless though, a headless chicken of a beast, crashing about the place and circling all around itself (thematically). Character's motivations shift without any real good reason given (Blanchett wants to own up for her crimes, and then does not. Why?) The characters are grand enough but the relationship between Ribisi and Blanchett is entirely unconvincing - it's portrayed more as a kid crush that Ribisi has. This is the movie's biggest flaw - it's not going anywhere and ends up crashing (perhaps the opening sequence is a meta commentary on how the plot drives itself into a nothing of a dead end). It's not like that it's boring, it's more you're left at the end going, `Well what was the point of all that?' That's not good.\n\nActing? Blanchett is an acquired taste - very subdued, much more sublime than a lot of other Hollywood faces. Here it suits her fine - she's a tired, defeated woman, with a small bit of steel still inside her. She does tend to drift through the movie a bit, as if not really sure how to grasp her character. Ribisi again is good, although a bit too fresh-faced to carry any real chemistry with his co-star. At least he gets to talk, for a large bit, in a language other than English.\n\nSo is there anything to redeem this? Yup - the photography. Mmm - tasty! Director Tom Tykwer has some utterly wonderful shots - check out the gorgeous train motion shot, or the simply stunning twilight embrace later on. There're also some superb aerial and isometric shots. It's great for setting the atmosphere and distracting you from the aimless, drifting plot. It's all accompanied by a simple but pleasing musical score - basic piano, but mood setting without being distracting. The movie is also not too long so it doesn't overstay its welcome (so you do not become too irritated with its lack of focus).\n\n`Heaven' is, if nothing else, a breath of fresh air. It looks great, has a nice and sedate pace that is too often lacking in the flash/bang of the modern flick. The weak script means it cannot be anything ever great, but its worth a perusal if you fancy a change from the mundane. 6/10."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25273,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2002-02-21","keywords":"fantastical ending,love,death,bomb,police","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2250745369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT# 2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000610/","name":"Giovanni Ribisi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320969/","name":"Remo Girone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001425/","name":"Krzysztof Kieslowski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682830/","name":"Krzysztof Piesiewicz"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

She's out to kill a drugs lord, who indirectly caused her husband to die. She wants to blow him to bits, but her bomb ends up killing four innocents. Now she merely wants to finish her revenge. but imprisoned she'll need help. Enter young guard, Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi).\n\nHmm. you see once you've got the plot. the movie doesn't go anywhere. It's a thriller/revenge story. and then it tries to morph into a love story. It's aimless though, a headless chicken of a beast, crashing about the place and circling all around itself (thematically). Character's motivations shift without any real good reason given (Blanchett wants to own up for her crimes, and then does not. Why?) The characters are grand enough but the relationship between Ribisi and Blanchett is entirely unconvincing - it's portrayed more as a kid crush that Ribisi has. This is the movie's biggest flaw - it's not going anywhere and ends up crashing (perhaps the opening sequence is a meta commentary on how the plot drives itself into a nothing of a dead end). It's not like that it's boring, it's more you're left at the end going, `Well what was the point of all that?' That's not good.\n\nActing? Blanchett is an acquired taste - very subdued, much more sublime than a lot of other Hollywood faces. Here it suits her fine - she's a tired, defeated woman, with a small bit of steel still inside her. She does tend to drift through the movie a bit, as if not really sure how to grasp her character. Ribisi again is good, although a bit too fresh-faced to carry any real chemistry with his co-star. At least he gets to talk, for a large bit, in a language other than English.\n\nSo is there anything to redeem this? Yup - the photography. Mmm - tasty! Director Tom Tykwer has some utterly wonderful shots - check out the gorgeous train motion shot, or the simply stunning twilight embrace later on. There're also some superb aerial and isometric shots. It's great for setting the atmosphere and distracting you from the aimless, drifting plot. It's all accompanied by a simple but pleasing musical score - basic piano, but mood setting without being distracting. The movie is also not too long so it doesn't overstay its welcome (so you do not become too irritated with its lack of focus).\n\n`Heaven' is, if nothing else, a breath of fresh air. It looks great, has a nice and sedate pace that is too often lacking in the flash/bang of the modern flick. The weak script means it cannot be anything ever great, but its worth a perusal if you fancy a change from the mundane. 6/10.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25273,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2002-02-21","keywords":"fantastical ending,love,death,bomb,police","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2250745369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT# 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000610/","name":"Giovanni Ribisi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320969/","name":"Remo Girone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001425/","name":"Krzysztof Kieslowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682830/","name":"Krzysztof Piesiewicz"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought that Christine was one of Stephen King's weaker novels (and John Carpenter's movie version was similarly weak), but I tried to be as open-minded as possible. The first third of the movie, which is mysterious and interesting, was enough to make me think that perhaps some of the reviews on here were a bit too harsh. The score is also quite good, and it's used to great effect in the movie. Once the movie starts in earnest, however, it becomes formulaic and boring, though it picks up again near the climax.\n\nThe director did the French cult movie Malefique, which I liked, but it essentially boiled down to Hellraiser in a jail cell with painfully, self-consciously quirky characters. This movie dispenses with the overly quirky characters to give you somewhat bland and generic characters, thanks to the dismal writing of Benjamin Carr (the genius responsible for writing Thirteen Ghosts, Hellraiser: Deader, and a whole slew of Charles Band movies). Though the actors infuse their characters with some personality, none of them are particularly memorable or even interesting. There's a bit of pointless, filler back story on some of them, but, really, they're just meant to be nameless, forgettable fodder for a killer car. It's unfortunate that the scenes involving characterization or back story feel like filler, because I think the actors could have done some pretty decent performances given better material. Still, for a low budget movie about a car that eats people, the performances were credible. The nice guys were likable and the douchebags were appropriately unlikeable.\n\nThe real problem I had with this movie (besides the concept of a car that eats people, of course), was that it just gets plain *boring* near the middle. Humans bicker over who the leader is. Killer car makes ominous growling noises as it sneaks up on them. Humans scatter and run for their lives. Killer car chases after them -- though not driving fast enough to quite run them down -- until the scene drags on for several minutes. Repeat several times. It's just not very interesting.\n\nAfter the killer car has eaten a few people, pruning down the cast, the pacing gets a bit better and the action scenes become a bit more interesting. Unfortunately, the low budget CGI comes to the forefront here, whereas it was previously used somewhat sparingly. For the apparent budget, the CGI isn't all that bad, but if you're used to something like James Cameron's Avatar, I think you'll be a bit disappointed.\n\nI don't think this movie quite deserves its 3.x rating, but it's definitely not something that I'd recommend to casual horror/thriller fans. For junkies like me, it's enjoyable enough for a watch, as long as you're not too demanding.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1778,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-04","keywords":"creature feature,girl in bra and panties,blue bra and panties,female protagonist,killer car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Hybrid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi530422809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYwMzMzMjczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE2NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYwMzMzMjczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE2NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Late one night, a mysterious car is brought into the Chicago police impound garage after a deadly traffic accident.

The scientific theories proposed by the story are chillingly accurate, and they are what hooked me initially. It's refreshing to see science-fact made understandable and yes, entertaining (the tangerine/battery visual was funny). But the film goes beyond simply laying out facts and ideas to tell the story. It puts together a group of characters that have real issues in dealing with the problem, and with each other. There is a father/son relationship (Charles Shaunessy and Clive Revill) that is touching and real, funny and even corny at times. Tracey Nelson and Kieren Hutchinson play doctors coping with the crisis, but they still have a playful side to their relationship. And the actor playing their patient, Al (Ismael Carlo), is both unsettling and tender.\n\nIn the end, the disaster unfolds like it might in any other disaster flick (although, as I mentioned, without the huge big budget fx).

But for Cohen fans, I don't remember hearing the song in the film, only the lyrics spoken at the beginning and end. So, much like the movie "Starman" which does not have the Bowie song, it's a bit of a bummer.\n\nIf you can get past that, no problem.\n\nThe film itself is like a blend of "The Lake House", "The Time Traveler's Wife" and "Sleeping with the Enemy" with maybe a dash of "Angel Heart" with its sexuality and diabolical symbolism. It takes a deliberately fragmented, psueudo-supernatural approach, challenging the viewer like in "The Lake House". It features a character traveling through time like in "The Time Traveler's Wife", and it revolves around a quietly abusive relationship between a man &amp; a woman like in "Sleeping with the Enemy". Throw them all together and mix vigorously with a dash of very nice jazz trumpet music, and there you have "A Thousand Kisses Deep".\n\nIt is NOT a "science fiction" as I've read in some places (why do people see "time travel" and immediately think HG Welles and Star Trek??). And it's definitely not a "romance", unless your idea of romance includes borderline rape, borderline paedophilia and something even worse which I won't ruin for you. It's not a straightforward thriller because there's not really any terror. So this film is pretty hard to classify except to say that it's the story of a woman who is trying to fix her past, present and future before it ends in disaster.\n\nBy the way, although I just threw a bunch of spooky themes at you (rape, paedophilia, etc), don't worry because the film is not explicit or graphic in any way. It implies a lot of things, but I don't think there's any nudity other than Jodie Whittaker's backside shown through a closet door. This subtle style of filmmaking is prevalent in the whole movie, which means there aren't a lot of melodramatic clichés or people shouting &amp; breaking things. What's funny is that the *lack* of action/violence makes the film even more sinister to me.\n\nAnother interesting spin is the way the story is very dreamlike--symbolic and metaphoric rather than realistic--so you don't get caught up analyzing plot details. For example, the time traveler is never recognized by any of the other characters even though you'd think they would. Also, settings don't change either, and although some characters age expectedly, others stay the same. It sets an interesting tone, as if telling us (like a dream) that certain appearances are not as important as their meaning.\n\nThis is director Dana Lustig's latest film credit (as of 2014), and I hope there are many more to come. It is one of the rare thrillers with a female perspective which I (a guy) find so much more provocative than the standard Hollywood thrillers about some dude who's steamrolling through the story trying to be cool. "A Thousand Kisses Deep" has just enough enough pauses for reflection while maintaining its momentum. Definitely give this a whirl if you're looking for a movie that's pensive yet provocative and certainly different from all the rest.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":483,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Romance","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-06-15","keywords":"four word title,title directed by female,written by director,female protagonist,abusive boyfriend","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Thousand Kisses Deep","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1763615513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for A Thousand Kisses Deep"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288976/","name":"Emilia Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092886/","name":"Jodie Whittaker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001831/","name":"David Warner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527325/","name":"Dana Lustig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293122/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476384/","name":"Alex Kustanovich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3730130/","name":"Vadim Moldovan"}],"duration":"PT1H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has the plot twists, the plethora of pop tunes, the conniving characters, the backstabbings, the high life, the low life, the disgruntled females merciless attached to crooked husbands, the stranded children, and so on. But it's new. Fresh out of the oven. Baked with wonderful performances and tight scriptwriting. And it has characters who inhabit the story and make it their own.\n\nThe movie begins in medias res, with two con men -- and one con lady -- attempting to buy out a Jersey mayor. There's a lovely opening shot of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale, almost unrecognisable) carefully and painstakingly combing over his thinning strands of hair. This scene reminded me very much of the opening of Richard Linklater's Bernie, where a plump but serene mortician played by Jack Black joyfully lectures a scarce hall of students on the process of embalming. It's a slow scene, maybe too slow to open up a movie, but we are never bored, because we are given insight to a skill that we've never seen before, or don't know much about. It's the same with this scene. I've never seen anyone cover up bald. It's always bald being uncovered; wigs and toupees accidentally being ripped off, or blown away by strong winds. The scene also informs us that Irving is a certain kind of character.\n\nAfter jumping to a series of flashbacks, in which the history between Irving and his long-time girlfriend Sydney (Amy Adams, almost unrecognisable without her makeup) is revealed to have blossomed over a shared love of Duke Ellington, the plot begins proper. Irving and Sydney -- now posing as a wealthy British banker named Edith -- have been arrested by Richie (Bradley Cooper, fully recognisable despite his hairdo), an ambitious FBI agent who thinks he has the wit and skill to take down corrupt congressmen and casino gangsters with flimsy, ill-conceived plans. He ropes Irving and Sydney into his little schemes, and soon has them taking on an entire network of illegal tradesmen.\n\nCaught in the middle are two people: Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Carmine is the mayor whom the trio wanted to con at the start of the movie. He becomes integral to the plot when Irving develops a friendship with him. Do I tell him that I've been conning him all along, and that my innocent little scheme might get him arrested in front of his wife and six children? Or do I stay quiet, maintain the friendship, and face my conscience alone? What he does, I will not say.\n\nRosalyn is an interesting character. Yes, she skirts dangerously close to the Sharon Stones and Lorraine Braccos of the old Scorsese pictures, but Jennifer Lawrence is able to lift her away from them by being more grounded. Stone always seemed to operate on her own terms in Casino. She was a third wheel, functioning outside of the overall story. Here, Rosalyn is fully aware of the situation at hand. She's right smack in the middle of the story. She doesn't love Irving. Irving doesn't love her. But they both love their son, and Rosalyn doesn't want a divorce tarnishing her solid family marital integrity. But she knows that the love festering in the household is only producing toxic fumes. Where her character goes is a place best kept hidden.\n\nAnd then there's a mix of other secondary characters, including perhaps the best cameo I've seen (not because of the cameo itself, but because of the meaning of the cameo). All of them dip in and out of this intelligent story with impact. Why, even Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.), is a lovely guy. He provides much of the movie's humour, and there is much of it. Director David O. Russell has said that his goal with American Hustle was to focus on the characters instead of the plot. Indeed, what a good decision. It's a rare moment when not a single character seems out of place. They complement each other, whether they're kissing, punching, clawing, or scratching. And they share so much chemistry that you could select any two of them at random, chuck them into an empty room, and watch them chatter till their throats went dry.\n\nI attended a screening of this movie in Mandurah, which is a lovely place. The cinema had maybe nine other patrons (weird, considering it was opening day). I'd been to Mandurah a few times before, and I watched The Counselor there. That was a poor movie, but the screening was smooth, which is more than I can say for the screening of this film. With about 15 minutes to go, the video jammed and stuttered slowly to a halt. It's the first time I've seen digital video jam. And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. The projectionist eventually rectified the problem, but I had already been sucked out of the moment. That's a pity, because American Hustle was shaping up to be one of the best movies of the year. You know what? Screw it. It still is."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":464512,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-12-20","keywords":"con artist,based on true story,drunk wife,wife meets mistress,sting operation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2928060441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTYxNTI5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTYxNTI5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Con man Irving Rosenfeld and his lover Sydney Prosser are forced to work for an unhinged FBI agent who pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting.

Irving and Sydney -- now posing as a wealthy British banker named Edith -- have been arrested by Richie (Bradley Cooper, fully recognisable despite his hairdo), an ambitious FBI agent who thinks he has the wit and skill to take down corrupt congressmen and casino gangsters with flimsy, ill-conceived plans. He ropes Irving and Sydney into his little schemes, and soon has them taking on an entire network of illegal tradesmen.\n\nCaught in the middle are two people: Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Carmine is the mayor whom the trio wanted to con at the start of the movie. He becomes integral to the plot when Irving develops a friendship with him. Do I tell him that I've been conning him all along, and that my innocent little scheme might get him arrested in front of his wife and six children? Or do I stay quiet, maintain the friendship, and face my conscience alone? What he does, I will not say.\n\nRosalyn is an interesting character. Yes, she skirts dangerously close to the Sharon Stones and Lorraine Braccos of the old Scorsese pictures, but Jennifer Lawrence is able to lift her away from them by being more grounded. Stone always seemed to operate on her own terms in Casino. She was a third wheel, functioning outside of the overall story. Here, Rosalyn is fully aware of the situation at hand. She's right smack in the middle of the story. She doesn't love Irving. Irving doesn't love her. But they both love their son, and Rosalyn doesn't want a divorce tarnishing her solid family marital integrity. But she knows that the love festering in the household is only producing toxic fumes. Where her character goes is a place best kept hidden.\n\nAnd then there's a mix of other secondary characters, including perhaps the best cameo I've seen (not because of the cameo itself, but because of the meaning of the cameo). All of them dip in and out of this intelligent story with impact. Why, even Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.), is a lovely guy. He provides much of the movie's humour, and there is much of it. Director David O. Russell has said that his goal with American Hustle was to focus on the characters instead of the plot. Indeed, what a good decision. It's a rare moment when not a single character seems out of place. They complement each other, whether they're kissing, punching, clawing, or scratching. And they share so much chemistry that you could select any two of them at random, chuck them into an empty room, and watch them chatter till their throats went dry.\n\nI attended a screening of this movie in Mandurah, which is a lovely place. The cinema had maybe nine other patrons (weird, considering it was opening day). I'd been to Mandurah a few times before, and I watched The Counselor there. That was a poor movie, but the screening was smooth, which is more than I can say for the screening of this film. With about 15 minutes to go, the video jammed and stuttered slowly to a halt. It's the first time I've seen digital video jam. And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. The projectionist eventually rectified the problem, but I had already been sucked out of the moment. That's a pity, because American Hustle was shaping up to be one of the best movies of the year. You know what? Screw it. It still is.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":464512,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-12-20","keywords":"con artist,based on true story,drunk wife,wife meets mistress,sting operation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2928060441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTYxNTI5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTYxNTI5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM0NDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Con man Irving Rosenfeld and his lover Sydney Prosser are forced to work for an unhinged FBI agent who pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting.

"Desperate times, desperate measures" is a phrase that dates back to ancient Greek physician Hippocrates (he of the Hippocratic Oath), and has been applied in many and varied situations since ... war strategy being one of the most common. We hear the phrase a couple of times in the War Room during an early scene in the feature film directorial debut of writer-director Sven Huybrechts submarine movie. The term "submarine movie" is used with the utmost respect, as I'm a huge fan of the sub-genre.\n\nOpening with a well-orchestrated attack on Nazi soldiers, we are soon in the midst of a group of resistance fighters - a rag tag bunch committed to wiping out as many Nazis as possible. In the War Room scene, this group is referred to as "The Bad Eggs", and everyone from all sides seems to want them stopped. However, there is a problem - this group is made up of the only ones crazy enough to accept the current 'suicide' mission: delivering a Uranium filled submarine from the Belgian Congo to the United States, where the cargo will be used for the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe cast is excellent, led by the ongoing conflict between two outstanding and renowned leads: Belgian actor Koen De Bouw as Nazi-hater Stan, and German actor Thure Riefenstein as captured U-Boat Captain Franz Jager. Co-writers Huybrechts and Johan Horemans effectively use the dangers and claustrophobia of the submarine, and are truly expert in their pitting Stan against Jager. Stan's beautiful (and sharpshooter) daughter Nadine (Ella-June Henrard) is also on the mission, but it's Stan's tragic backstory (which we see in tension-filled flashbacks) that have filled him with a lust for revenge and over-protectiveness.\n\nTraining for submarine crews typically lasts a year, and this group of misfits has only three weeks to prepare. Some of the early soundtrack reminds of the iconic Elmer Bernstein theme to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, which comes across a bit misplaced, but that's a minor quibble for a film that gets most everything else right - except for a too-good-to-be-true sequence near the end. Along the way, we see vivid images of the brutality and cruelty of Nazis, which helps us understand why all of these folks are so committed to the mission.\n\nWorking with a low budget, the film still manages to deliver the danger and tense situations we expect from a submarine during WWII. There is even a sub vs sub battle for some underwater action. The lineup of other worthy submarine movies over the years include: Jules Verne's 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA (1954), THE ENEMY BELOW (1957) with Robert Mitchum, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP (1958) with Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster, ICE STATION ZEBRA (1968) based on the Alistair MacLean novel, the nerve-rattling DAS BOOT (1981) from Werner Herzog, THE ABYSS (1989) from James Cameron, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER (1990) from Tom Clancy's novel starring Sean Connery, CRIMSON TIDE (1995) pitting Denzel Washington against Gene Hackman, U-571 (2000) with the great Thomas Kretschmann, and BLACK SEA (2014) with Jude Law. And let's not forget the 1968 classic featuring The Beatles animated, YELLOW SUBMARIINE.\n\nThis latest begins in 1941 and the final scene takes place on August 6, 1945. Huybrechts's film could be described as a cross between INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and DAS BOOT, and it includes plenty of material for conversation on race, religion, nationality, and duty.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Action","Adventure","History"],"datePublished":"2019-10-23","keywords":"submarine,u boat,submarine movie,war at sea,claustrophobic setting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Torpedo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286758425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI4Yjg0NGUtNjg1YS00YzFmLWJmY2QtMWM0OWM1YzgwMDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI4Yjg0NGUtNjg1YS00YzFmLWJmY2QtMWM0OWM1YzgwMDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100460/","name":"Koen De Bouw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0726167/","name":"Thure Riefenstein"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3616170/","name":"Ella-June Henrard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404748/","name":"Sven Huybrechts"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293701/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287211/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034024/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393822/","name":"Johan Horemans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404748/","name":"Sven Huybrechts"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The lives of the residents of an apartment building change when the owner is accidentally killed by one of the inhabitant. It take a while to get the hang of the pulse of the movie and it requires a lot of patience. The main protagonist is a loner and a voyeur who misses his ill(mentally) brother from whom he gets his taped messages. Meanwhile he is trying to dispose off the dead body of the owner. \n\nYou do not fall in love with its characters or empathize with them but it definitely scares you to see their lives and you pray not to end up like them. But there are few moments when you feel sad for the people portrayed who are stuck in their little world and have distant hopes of escape from it. This movie forces you to confront or at least acknowledge the alienation,apathy,and surrender of some in the modern society who live on it fringe with little expectation of any worthwhile impact on anyone's life other than their own. But still it leaves you with a nice little message about forgiveness , family and the meaning of a well lived life.\n\nYou are not going to remember this movie for long but it's decently directed eerie movie for a select few who are patient enough to take a lesson home.\n\nPS: Watch at your own risk.Either you will hate it or you will applaud the efforts for such a real depiction of lives in small apartments!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7657,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"keywords":"punched in the stomach,scene of the crime,fellatio,landlord,talking to oneself in a mirror","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1273603865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5Mzc5NzM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMyMTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5Mzc5NzM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMyMTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Franklin Franklin plays the alphorn and dreams of Switzerland.

The lives of the residents of an apartment building change when the owner is accidentally killed by one of the inhabitant. It take a while to get the hang of the pulse of the movie and it requires a lot of patience. The main protagonist is a loner and a voyeur who misses his ill(mentally) brother from whom he gets his taped messages. Meanwhile he is trying to dispose off the dead body of the owner. \n\nYou do not fall in love with its characters or empathize with them but it definitely scares you to see their lives and you pray not to end up like them. But there are few moments when you feel sad for the people portrayed who are stuck in their little world and have distant hopes of escape from it. This movie forces you to confront or at least acknowledge the alienation,apathy,and surrender of some in the modern society who live on it fringe with little expectation of any worthwhile impact on anyone's life other than their own. But still it leaves you with a nice little message about forgiveness , family and the meaning of a well lived life.\n\nYou are not going to remember this movie for long but it's decently directed eerie movie for a select few who are patient enough to take a lesson home.\n\nPS: Watch at your own risk.Either you will hate it or you will applaud the efforts for such a real depiction of lives in small apartments!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7657,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"keywords":"punched in the stomach,scene of the crime,fellatio,landlord,talking to oneself in a mirror","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1273603865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5Mzc5NzM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMyMTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5Mzc5NzM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMyMTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Franklin Franklin plays the alphorn and dreams of Switzerland.

Across the street live a mother and her fifteen-year-old daughter, whom he likes to watch from his window, but none of these are Franklin's real problem. His real problem is that his landlord is dead, laid out on the linoleum of his kitchen, and Switzerland seems farther away all the time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524240/","name":"Matt Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001780/","name":"Peter Stormare","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0959774/","name":"Jonas Åkerlund"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337652/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139919/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2411346/","name":"Chris Millis"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At worst  bigoted and offensive","reviewBody":"Earl Montgomery is a cop wannabe who can't get past the academy into the force.  Hank Rafferty is a real cop who is emotionally on edge having seen the murder of his partner by a gang raiding a warehouse.  When the two get involved in a minor roadside traffic stop, Earl claims Hank beat him and gets him thrown off the force.  Hank takes up a job as a security guard and sets out to find the gang that killed his partner.  He finds them in a warehouse protected by Earl (also now a security guard) and the two reluctantly team up to go after the gang.  However when they steal the gang's merchandise they find themselves hunted by both the gang and the cops.\n\nAlthough I like to think of myself as having reasonably good taste  I do find Martin Lawrence funny.  I don't know why but many of his films just make me laugh even though I feel like I shouldn't !  However this film is the recent exception to that.  I saw the trailer and thought that it might be worth a stab  wrong!  The plot is a shambles of coincidence and plot holes  where there is a doubt they simply have a big gun fight.  There is no real tension to the plot as it is so very loose  even at the end you'll struggle to know much about the plot outside of the two central characters.\n\nThe action scenes make the A-Team look realistic and tense  they are simply tonnes of bullets flying everywhere before the bad guys are dispatched with one shot!  This sucks any excitement or tension out of them and only leaves you with lots of noise that just feels pointless in the extreme.  In that way they reflect the wider plot I guess.  Sadly though, the poor action and poor plot is by no means the worst part of this film.\n\nEasily the worst part of this film is the fact that 99% of the `jokes' are based on race  in particular Martin Lawrence's comments which are either a) laments on the victimisation of his race or b) reverse-racism remarks that border on the offensive and would certainly never be allowed to pass if the lines had been given to his white co-star.  The victimisation things are simply not funny and merely make the lead look like he has an enormous chip on his shoulder about his colour  maybe 2 or 3 remarks along these lines would have worked but to have nearly every line based on this is simply overkill and it quickly gets tiresome.  Other remarks I simply found offensive  I'm sorry, I know this is meant to be a comedy but I found them bigoted in the extreme.  What makes it worse is the fact that the film plays Earl as a hero and never shows him to change his way or his opinion  hence it validates what he says.  For example to have a character state that he is against interracial relationships between white men and black women (and never take it back) is simply offensive  as I (a white man) sat with my wife of Nigerian-descent I felt very uncomfortable that anyone would allow such insulting dialogue to be part of a film.  Even if you think I am making a big deal out of nothing  just imagine this whole film if even half of Earl's dialogue had been said by Hank  there would simply have been an outcry!\n\nTo make the offensive material worse  it is rarely funny.  I don't know what Lawrence is up to.  This summer he has the chance to kick start his big league career again in Bad Boys 2 where he'll get help from Smith and Union  but this is a huge leap back  pandering to an audience that may find it funny because they too have a chip on their shoulder about race.  I usually find his mugging and saying `yo ass' or `and sh*t' after every sentence funny but here the chip on his character should simply obliterates everything else.  Zahn is poor  I have not seen him in a strong role but this must be a step backwards even by his standards  he suffers at the hands of racist remarks and comes off badly  even his relationship with Denise is played for laughs as the writers expected the audience to find it a joke that Hank could land with a `fine sista' like that, it even goes so far as to have Denise admire Earl's penis!!  In fairness Robinne Lee (Denise) is gorgeous and it is good to see her in something again after only seeing her in Hav Plenty.

At worst  bigoted and offensive","reviewBody":"Earl Montgomery is a cop wannabe who can't get past the academy into the force.  Hank Rafferty is a real cop who is emotionally on edge having seen the murder of his partner by a gang raiding a warehouse.  When the two get involved in a minor roadside traffic stop, Earl claims Hank beat him and gets him thrown off the force.  Hank takes up a job as a security guard and sets out to find the gang that killed his partner.  He finds them in a warehouse protected by Earl (also now a security guard) and the two reluctantly team up to go after the gang.  However when they steal the gang's merchandise they find themselves hunted by both the gang and the cops.\n\nAlthough I like to think of myself as having reasonably good taste  I do find Martin Lawrence funny.  I don't know why but many of his films just make me laugh even though I feel like I shouldn't !  However this film is the recent exception to that.  I saw the trailer and thought that it might be worth a stab  wrong!  The plot is a shambles of coincidence and plot holes  where there is a doubt they simply have a big gun fight.  There is no real tension to the plot as it is so very loose  even at the end you'll struggle to know much about the plot outside of the two central characters.\n\nThe action scenes make the A-Team look realistic and tense  they are simply tonnes of bullets flying everywhere before the bad guys are dispatched with one shot!  This sucks any excitement or tension out of them and only leaves you with lots of noise that just feels pointless in the extreme.  In that way they reflect the wider plot I guess.  Sadly though, the poor action and poor plot is by no means the worst part of this film.\n\nEasily the worst part of this film is the fact that 99% of the `jokes' are based on race  in particular Martin Lawrence's comments which are either a) laments on the victimisation of his race or b) reverse-racism remarks that border on the offensive and would certainly never be allowed to pass if the lines had been given to his white co-star.  The victimisation things are simply not funny and merely make the lead look like he has an enormous chip on his shoulder about his colour  maybe 2 or 3 remarks along these lines would have worked but to have nearly every line based on this is simply overkill and it quickly gets tiresome.  Other remarks I simply found offensive  I'm sorry, I know this is meant to be a comedy but I found them bigoted in the extreme.  What makes it worse is the fact that the film plays Earl as a hero and never shows him to change his way or his opinion  hence it validates what he says.  For example to have a character state that he is against interracial relationships between white men and black women (and never take it back) is simply offensive  as I (a white man) sat with my wife of Nigerian-descent I felt very uncomfortable that anyone would allow such insulting dialogue to be part of a film.  Even if you think I am making a big deal out of nothing  just imagine this whole film if even half of Earl's dialogue had been said by Hank  there would simply have been an outcry!\n\nTo make the offensive material worse  it is rarely funny.  I don't know what Lawrence is up to.  This summer he has the chance to kick start his big league career again in Bad Boys 2 where he'll get help from Smith and Union  but this is a huge leap back  pandering to an audience that may find it funny because they too have a chip on their shoulder about race.  I usually find his mugging and saying `yo ass' or `and sh*t' after every sentence funny but here the chip on his character should simply obliterates everything else.  Zahn is poor  I have not seen him in a strong role but this must be a step backwards even by his standards  he suffers at the hands of racist remarks and comes off badly  even his relationship with Denise is played for laughs as the writers expected the audience to find it a joke that Hank could land with a `fine sista' like that, it even goes so far as to have Denise admire Earl's penis!!  In fairness Robinne Lee (Denise) is gorgeous and it is good to see her in something again after only seeing her in Hav Plenty. God knows why Eric Roberts is in it  he has nothing to do and his wig just looked stupid, likewise Bill Duke is only there for the dirty looks.\n\nOverall I enjoy Lawrence comedies even though many are silly.  Here the jokes are nearly all based on race or reverse-racism and after the first 3 time they get increasingly unfunny and tired.  At best this film is lame and barely amusing, at worst it is simply bigoted (regardless of what colour the character is  bigotry is bigotry) and will be offensive to anyone who tries to get past the issues of race and racism in their daily lives.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-03-12","keywords":"los angeles police department,lapd,ex con,race relations,dirty cop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"National Security","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi497942809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdmYWY1NzMtZDZhOC00OTM5LWJkNjUtOGQzYWE5NGM2ZmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdmYWY1NzMtZDZhOC00OTM5LWJkNjUtOGQzYWE5NGM2ZmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001872/","name":"Steve Zahn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272173/","name":"Colm Feore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014629/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771065/","name":"Jay Scherick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740115/","name":"David Ronn"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At worst  bigoted and offensive","reviewBody":"Earl Montgomery is a cop wannabe who can't get past the academy into the force.  Hank Rafferty is a real cop who is emotionally on edge having seen the murder of his partner by a gang raiding a warehouse.  When the two get involved in a minor roadside traffic stop, Earl claims Hank beat him and gets him thrown off the force.  Hank takes up a job as a security guard and sets out to find the gang that killed his partner.  He finds them in a warehouse protected by Earl (also now a security guard) and the two reluctantly team up to go after the gang.  However when they steal the gang's merchandise they find themselves hunted by both the gang and the cops.\n\nAlthough I like to think of myself as having reasonably good taste  I do find Martin Lawrence funny.  I don't know why but many of his films just make me laugh even though I feel like I shouldn't !  However this film is the recent exception to that.  I saw the trailer and thought that it might be worth a stab  wrong!  The plot is a shambles of coincidence and plot holes  where there is a doubt they simply have a big gun fight.  There is no real tension to the plot as it is so very loose  even at the end you'll struggle to know much about the plot outside of the two central characters.\n\nThe action scenes make the A-Team look realistic and tense  they are simply tonnes of bullets flying everywhere before the bad guys are dispatched with one shot!  This sucks any excitement or tension out of them and only leaves you with lots of noise that just feels pointless in the extreme.  In that way they reflect the wider plot I guess.  Sadly though, the poor action and poor plot is by no means the worst part of this film.\n\nEasily the worst part of this film is the fact that 99% of the `jokes' are based on race  in particular Martin Lawrence's comments which are either a) laments on the victimisation of his race or b) reverse-racism remarks that border on the offensive and would certainly never be allowed to pass if the lines had been given to his white co-star.  The victimisation things are simply not funny and merely make the lead look like he has an enormous chip on his shoulder about his colour  maybe 2 or 3 remarks along these lines would have worked but to have nearly every line based on this is simply overkill and it quickly gets tiresome.  Other remarks I simply found offensive  I'm sorry, I know this is meant to be a comedy but I found them bigoted in the extreme.  What makes it worse is the fact that the film plays Earl as a hero and never shows him to change his way or his opinion  hence it validates what he says.  For example to have a character state that he is against interracial relationships between white men and black women (and never take it back) is simply offensive  as I (a white man) sat with my wife of Nigerian-descent I felt very uncomfortable that anyone would allow such insulting dialogue to be part of a film.  Even if you think I am making a big deal out of nothing  just imagine this whole film if even half of Earl's dialogue had been said by Hank  there would simply have been an outcry!\n\nTo make the offensive material worse  it is rarely funny.  I don't know what Lawrence is up to.  This summer he has the chance to kick start his big league career again in Bad Boys 2 where he'll get help from Smith and Union  but this is a huge leap back  pandering to an audience that may find it funny because they too have a chip on their shoulder about race.  I usually find his mugging and saying `yo ass' or `and sh*t' after every sentence funny but here the chip on his character should simply obliterates everything else.  Zahn is poor  I have not seen him in a strong role but this must be a step backwards even by his standards  he suffers at the hands of racist remarks and comes off badly  even his relationship with Denise is played for laughs as the writers expected the audience to find it a joke that Hank could land with a `fine sista' like that, it even goes so far as to have Denise admire Earl's penis!!  In fairness Robinne Lee (Denise) is gorgeous and it is good to see her in something again after only seeing her in Hav Plenty. God knows why Eric Roberts is in it  he has nothing to do and his wig just looked stupid, likewise Bill Duke is only there for the dirty looks.\n\nOverall I enjoy Lawrence comedies even though many are silly.  Here the jokes are nearly all based on race or reverse-racism and after the first 3 time they get increasingly unfunny and tired.  At best this film is lame and barely amusing, at worst it is simply bigoted (regardless of what colour the character is  bigotry is bigotry) and will be offensive to anyone who tries to get past the issues of race and racism in their daily lives."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-03-12","keywords":"los angeles police department,lapd,ex con,race relations,dirty cop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"National Security","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi497942809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdmYWY1NzMtZDZhOC00OTM5LWJkNjUtOGQzYWE5NGM2ZmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdmYWY1NzMtZDZhOC00OTM5LWJkNjUtOGQzYWE5NGM2ZmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001872/","name":"Steve Zahn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272173/","name":"Colm Feore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014629/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771065/","name":"Jay Scherick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740115/","name":"David Ronn"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel.  If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection.  Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient.  In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":388060,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2003-08-27","keywords":"time travel,skynet,humanoid cyborg,exploding truck,nuclear launch","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2056585497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OGM3YTctZDhmYy00Y2IwLWExMDgtMDA2Mzg4MWM0YWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OGM3YTctZDhmYy00Y2IwLWExMDgtMDA2Mzg4MWM0YWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001763/","name":"Nick Stahl"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518085/","name":"Kristanna Loken"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609236/","name":"Jonathan Mostow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066021/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109128/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093328/","name":"Tedi Sarafian"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient.  In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":388060,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2003-08-27","keywords":"time travel,skynet,humanoid cyborg,exploding truck,nuclear launch","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2056585497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OGM3YTctZDhmYy00Y2IwLWExMDgtMDA2Mzg4MWM0YWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OGM3YTctZDhmYy00Y2IwLWExMDgtMDA2Mzg4MWM0YWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001763/","name":"Nick Stahl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518085/","name":"Kristanna Loken"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609236/","name":"Jonathan Mostow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066021/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109128/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093328/","name":"Tedi Sarafian"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Certainly a bittersweet reflection on the passing of time and the risk of forgetting who we are, the story well written, funny and at times even moving, The film features three unexpectedly excellent first ladies, perfectly at ease in their meeting with Aldo Giovanni and Giacomo as well as the return of their historic director, who still knows how to make the most of their potential.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-01-30","keywords":"friend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3128737305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA5Y2E2MWUtMTdkYS00NjI3LTg0NzQtNTZmZmQwMjA0MDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA5Y2E2MWUtMTdkYS00NjI3LTg0NzQtNTZmZmQwMjA0MDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017623/","name":"Aldo Baglio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320495/","name":"Giovanni Storti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316034/","name":"Giacomo Poretti"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893111/","name":"Massimo Venier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0254125/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3291357/","name":"Davide Lantieri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1614496/","name":"Michele Pellegrini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893111/","name":"Massimo Venier"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A Polish-directed/written film set in China with basically an entirely Chinese cast? A bit foreign for me (being from the US), to say the least.\n\nStarting out with the main character Wolski escaping from Russian Siberia into China, you watch as he is taken in by a poor Chinese family consisting of Guo, his wife, and their daughter Song. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, one night Song gets up from the dinner table and takes some food to Wolski. As soon as she sits down on his bed Guo comes in and knocks the food right out of her hand. From this moment on, Song is never the same, and you will see why.\n\nMy main complaint of this movie is that it is slow and lacks focus/direction in the early (after the first 9min) to middle parts. It is a bit slow but luckily it picks up in the last third.\n\nOne thing this movie does well is subtlety. Maybe this is a trait of foreign films in general?

Two Poles escape exile and cross the Siberian taiga to China. Crossing the Amur River ends tragically for one of them. The surviving man, unconscious, is found by an old Chinese hunter who takes him to his mountain shack. The hunter has a beautiful, sixteen year old daughter.

A Polish-directed/written film set in China with basically an entirely Chinese cast? A bit foreign for me (being from the US), to say the least.\n\nStarting out with the main character Wolski escaping from Russian Siberia into China, you watch as he is taken in by a poor Chinese family consisting of Guo, his wife, and their daughter Song. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, one night Song gets up from the dinner table and takes some food to Wolski. As soon as she sits down on his bed Guo comes in and knocks the food right out of her hand. From this moment on, Song is never the same, and you will see why.\n\nMy main complaint of this movie is that it is slow and lacks focus/direction in the early (after the first 9min) to middle parts. It is a bit slow but luckily it picks up in the last third.\n\nOne thing this movie does well is subtlety. Maybe this is a trait of foreign films in general? I am not sure because I haven't seen enough. My recommendation is if you're a fan of or interested in foreign films and enjoy short but sincere romances, then give this film a shot.\n\nOtherwise, it might not be for you.

It's not the most original or best film out there, but it was a romantic and beautiful story that was very delightful to watch.

Now, I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the "magic" of a certain movie if they refuse to see it, or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director, writer, or whatever. But after reading such lines as "if you liked this film, you know nothing about film" and so on, I simply couldn't contain myself.\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the "culture" that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or "hard", as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words: I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wife-beating and all around socially retarded mentality, I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But, after a time, I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it, at least to give it a chance. I popped it in, and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.\n\nFor those who've not yet seen the film, I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit, a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother, miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up (in a trailer park, barely able to make rent or take care of herself). Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's best ally and, in some ways, his father figure; playing the role of the protective, guidance providing, loving role-model. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as, through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness, he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to; nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems, he starts to see his path better and more clearly.\n\nNow, I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere, where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life, feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard, and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm; as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened, and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead, a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story, importance of cinematic elements throughout a story (i.e.: not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it), and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past, and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life, and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.\n\nTo close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.\n\nSee this movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-11-08","keywords":"self expression,competition,rap music,hip hop,proles","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"8 Mile","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi615776537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "March 18th""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004896/","name":"Eminem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106989/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798788/","name":"Scott Silver"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are no protections against the mountains and everyone knows it, even the viewer as you get the first glimpse of the environment the soldiers were put in.\n\nI recommend this movie and I think you will like it if you also like movie based on true events.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2020-07-03","keywords":"taliban,based on true story,battle,afghanistan,sniper","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Outpost","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1209384473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5ZWNjNTMtMTIxMC00NzAzLTg1YjUtZTA1Y2E4OThhZTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5ZWNjNTMtMTIxMC00NzAzLTg1YjUtZTA1Y2E4OThhZTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207222/","name":"Scott Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2655177/","name":"Caleb Landry Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527109/","name":"Rod Lurie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0646497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799957/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0651078/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848496/","name":"Paul Tamasy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2053216/","name":"Eric Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1311488/","name":"Jake Tapper"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Because it's Polish and we haven't had a lot of worthwhile Polish movies since Kieslowski?  Has it come to that?\n\nThe film takes Witold Gombrowicz's long-winded but intermittently fascinating classic novel and superimposes a gratuitous (and fatuous) Spielbergesque holocaust plot line, to make it all, I guess, more compelling.  The effect is glaringly contrived and (as with the far better Spielberg original) offensively trivializing.\n\nIn case anyone misses the point, the holocaust plot overlay involves a doomed little girl and, at the dénouement, a shift to a black-and-white background against which is displayed, in color, a talismanic link to her. Sound familiar?  Spielberg should sue.\n\nThe sad thing is that there is some talent at work here.  Though the plot is gratuitously confusing, meandering, and contrived, the use of a country house around which a low-intensity conflict between Germans and Polish partisans swirls obliquely is effective, with the fighting intruding suddenly into and then just as suddenly vanishing from the playing out of the protagonists' humdrum idleness and self-absorption.  Grayzna Blecka-Kolska gives a performance that almost transcends the clichés written into her role as the quietly tipsy châtelaine, and the two young people who are the objects of the middle-aged protagonists' dirty-old-man obsessions (Gombrowicz's central plot line, if no longer Kolski's) look as if they might have been far more effectively used in some other movie, one in which they were given something to do beyond standing around and looking beautiful (which they are, it should be said).  But on the whole, this is an over-the-top, pretentious dud, the sort of thing that should be seen only by the paid critics who then have a professional obligation and civic duty to spare all the rest of us such an irritating waste of our time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2003-10-17","keywords":"sex standing up,lift skirt,panties hit the floor,panties pulled down,fondling","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538048/","name":"Krzysztof Majchrzak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272295/","name":"Adam Ferency"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322937/","name":"Krzysztof Globisz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094194/","name":"Luc Bondy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102722/","name":"Gérard Brach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326822/","name":"Witold Gombrowicz"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Because it's Polish and we haven't had a lot of worthwhile Polish movies since Kieslowski?  Has it come to that?\n\nThe film takes Witold Gombrowicz's long-winded but intermittently fascinating classic novel and superimposes a gratuitous (and fatuous) Spielbergesque holocaust plot line, to make it all, I guess, more compelling.  The effect is glaringly contrived and (as with the far better Spielberg original) offensively trivializing.\n\nIn case anyone misses the point, the holocaust plot overlay involves a doomed little girl and, at the dénouement, a shift to a black-and-white background against which is displayed, in color, a talismanic link to her. Sound familiar?  Spielberg should sue.\n\nThe sad thing is that there is some talent at work here.  Though the plot is gratuitously confusing, meandering, and contrived, the use of a country house around which a low-intensity conflict between Germans and Polish partisans swirls obliquely is effective, with the fighting intruding suddenly into and then just as suddenly vanishing from the playing out of the protagonists' humdrum idleness and self-absorption.

The scene setting is particularly deft in this one.\n\nThe central performance is superior but when they've set up support players so well it's unsatisfying to not find their stories given an outcome.\n\nLush feel good European movie of the kind that plays well in English speaking country art theaters.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-11-07","keywords":"reference to montgomery clift,reference to gregory peck,reference to peter lorre,reference to humphrey bogart,vehicle design","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi247118361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlZjNlMzctY2I3Yi00ZmE2LTgwZTQtYzM4ZDAzMmFmNzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlZjNlMzctY2I3Yi00ZmE2LTgwZTQtYzM4ZDAzMmFmNzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1871951/","name":"Leïla Bekhti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2406198/","name":"Rebecca Marder"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1773597/","name":"Hervé Mimran"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315631/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1773597/","name":"Hervé Mimran","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277229/","name":"Hélène Fillières","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7013534/","name":"Christian Streiff"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B.

An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best.

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire. Indeed the others in their group more readily flirt and banter than the two in the title. It doesn't have a beginning, middle and end - it just has a middle. A rather interestingly filmed and quite well put together middle, but a middle nonetheless. Certainly worth watching - I think Dolan has something about him - but I wanted more from the characters and the story - as it is I just felt like a rather unsatisfied observer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-09","keywords":"gay character,friendship,kiss,in love with best friend,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707182105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8570499/","name":"Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2954178/","name":"Pier-Luc Funk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0489666/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093053/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The main characters deliver and my rather small complaint would that neither of them are actual martial artists and as there are a lot of hand-to-hand combat, sometimes it was not as smooth as it was supposed to be, but still very watchable.\n\nRecommended for action movie nights.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-08-21","keywords":"based on video game,hired killer,assassin,hitman,tattoo","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Global Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3823153945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc1MDI2MTY3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMxOTc0NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc1MDI2MTY3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMxOTc0NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Agent 47 is an elite assassin who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is the culmination of decades of research and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1670029/","name":"Rupert Friend","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3799669/","name":"Hannah Ware","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704270/","name":"Zachary Quinto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5507490/","name":"Aleksander Bach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030602/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0155543/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0940790/","name":"Skip Woods","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3360218/","name":"Michael Finch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412282/","name":"Morten Iversen"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This means that along with the beautiful autumn colors that emerge, the spooky season of Halloween also returns. Along with the jack o' lanterns, fun size candy, and parities, this is also when the often popular haunts come to town. These haunts cater to those that want something genuinely scary, as if they've stepped into their favorite horror movies...without the serial killers of course. I've only been to a few and have had more laughs then fears. This is because I more appreciate the haunts in a similar way a stage show is pulled off. \n\nSo why are there dedicated fans that keep going further with mazes where they tough you (yes, they can do that)? Again, it's a part of the Halloween atmosphere that a part of the escapism people desire. We already know were going to survive the night, but we love to see if our internal suspension of disbelief can activate and put us in the fear we want. I can understand it can be too intense for a lot of people, but again, it's all a part of the season. It's nice to see a movie like Hell Fest to set a slasher within a haunt park.\n\nA young college student Natalie (Played by Amy Forsyth) is visiting her former roommate Brooke (played by Reign Edwards) and classmate Taylor (played by Bex Taylor-Klaus). Not only are they going to the haunt park Hell Fest, but their meeting up with friends, including Gavin (played by Robby Attal) who got everyone V.I.P. passes (which means no line waiting). Along with the various people coming in, they see that Hell Fest of full of scare actors, several mazes to explore and even an entire land called "the Deadlands" where the actors are allowed to touch and go further with their scares. \n\nThe problem? An unnamed person enters the park and into the mazes and starts randomly killing off guests. Our heroes don't see anything wrong until this guy acquires a mask and starts to stalk them around. At first they dismiss him as a really good actor, but when friends start disappearing, they got more uneasy. Even when they try talking to security (who tells them that he can arrest someone for doing their job), they don't seem to have a lot of options. The further they get to the Deadlands, the more they feel like they've descended into hell.\n\nSo by reading this, you can already tell that Hell Fest follows a lot of slasher tropes that we've seen before; the group of college kids, unresponsive authority, walking along somewhere, killer with a mask, and such. This will definitely not appeal to those looking for a new kind of horror movie (like Hereditary). This seems to be more proud that it's trying to be a typical slasher. Because of that, I didn't mind it. A lot of it has to do with it's setting and atmosphere.\n\nHell Fest is full of theme park-like Halloween imagery that looks really cool. I was afraid they would try to pull off haunt mazes that only Hollywood effects teams were capable of. Instead, each maze has the right balance of over the top gory, but also over the top fakery. This feels like something that would be built at Knott's Berry Farm or Universal Studios. Part of me really wants to visit this place...without the killing of course. Even the scare actors seems spot on with some coming up to them at random points, and some in full makeup hosting scary shows about guillotines.\n\nStory is minimal as the what's served is an excuse to show off the park. The main actors like Amy Forsyth and Bex Taylor-Klaus do fine in their parts. Their interesting enough that we'd want to visit the park with them. Even when they are eventually chased by the killer (I swear, I don't even think they gave him a name), we do want to see them survive. Also like a lot of slashers, without giving anything away, it does tease for a potential sequel in a trope manner we've seen before. I'd, however, would love to see this continue.\n\nI'll give this seven tickets to Knott's Scary Farm out of ten. Hell Fest may be a typical slasher, but it's so atmospheric, that those that have been to these haunts will probably like it fine. It's hard to phrase it or be critical as it's also short, running no more then eighty-five minutes. It's a fun watch. So see it and understand it's all a prt of the show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16182,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-28","keywords":"amusement park,haunted house attraction,masked killer,slasher,group of friends","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Band Teaser Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220655897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A masked serial killer turns a horror themed amusement park into his own personal playground, terrorizing a group of friends while the rest of the patrons believe that it is all part of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6407242/","name":"Cynthea Mercado"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4806678/","name":"Stephen Conroy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5046593/","name":"Amy Forsyth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687427/","name":"Gregory Plotkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3466037/","name":"Seth M.

    <desc lang="pl">Die Hard: Directed by John McTiernan. With Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald VelJohnson, Paul Gleason. An NYPD officer tries to save his wife and several others taken hostage by German terrorists during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0095016/","name":"Die Hard","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRlNDUxZjAtOGQ4OC00OTNlLTgxNmQtYTBmMDgwZmNmNjkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_.jpg","description":"An NYPD officer tries to save his wife and several others taken hostage by German terrorists during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0095016/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"MadReviewer"},"dateCreated":"2001-07-31","inLanguage":"English","name":"The Perfect Modern Action Film","reviewBody":""Die Hard" is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  "Die Hard" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since "Die Hard" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of "Die Hard" . . . or, for that matter, is better than "Die Hard".\n\n "Die Hard" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .\n\nKudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, "Die Hard" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, "Die Hard" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With "Die Hard", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.\n\nAs for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.\n\nAlso worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual "damsel in distress" mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.\n\n"Die Hard" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is "Die Hard" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.

So he goes to a remote island to learn a whistling language that will allow him to communicate with the criminals from a distance. There he rekindles a relationship with his old flame and his priorities change. As both the criminals and his colleagues are onto Cristi what choices will he make to come out clean of his predicament? A clever game of cops and robbers ensues.\n\nSumming up this multi layered, not always coherent plot, is not an easy task. THE WHISTLERS takes a long time to get going but it's many elements come together building up to something special. Heavy on movie references it is heavily inspired by Tarantino movies, although the style of the cinematography is rather dull.\n\nThe script on paper must look great, but this is the case where a writer should let go of his work and let someone else direct.

So he goes to a remote island to learn a whistling language that will allow him to communicate with the criminals from a distance. There he rekindles a relationship with his old flame and his priorities change. As both the criminals and his colleagues are onto Cristi what choices will he make to come out clean of his predicament? A clever game of cops and robbers ensues.\n\nSumming up this multi layered, not always coherent plot, is not an easy task. THE WHISTLERS takes a long time to get going but it's many elements come together building up to something special. Heavy on movie references it is heavily inspired by Tarantino movies, although the style of the cinematography is rather dull.\n\nThe script on paper must look great, but this is the case where a writer should let go of his work and let someone else direct. Cornelliu Porumboiu helmed 13 films but seems to be still searching for his directing style. While all the cast do their job well, the motives of their characters for the majority of the film are obscure to say the least.\n\nBut if this is the originality you are looking for THE WHISTLERS is for you.

    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Praktyczny poradnik w duchu zero waste. Joanna Dymmel, autorka książki "Gdzie rosną pieniądze", udowadnia, że domy i mieszkania są pełne rzeczy, na których można zarobić. W szafach, na pawlaczach, na strychach, w piwnicach czy garażach zalegają przedmioty, które mogą być źródłem dodatkowej gotówki. Prowadząca odwiedzi widzów, by pomóc im wybrać, wycenić i przygotować do sprzedaży rozmaite rzeczy, mogące przynieść zysk bez wychodzenia z domu.</desc>

It was never made clear what Martins full duty was, or why he left the big city head office, and so on. It's as if a 5+ hour decent screenplay was shredded, and random pieces put together to total the final runtime. I could go on and on, but it's such a shame no one invested in a seasoned screenwriter to at least fine tune the script, as this production had many decent values to it. The pacing was also slow for my liking, and this film needed to be trimmed down to 90 mins (with a proper script) or played back at 1.2x speed.\n\nThe directing/camera work was well executed. The acting by all leads was spot on and convincing, but casting Beau Knapp as Martin was another big mistake. He didn't suit that role/character, and his acting was way too bland. He'd been better off being cast as one of the thugs, instead of pretty much sleeping in his suit trying to act like a white collar exec.\n\nThe score was too outstanding for this film... I mean top notch, and created some great tension and suspense, but seemed overbearing next to the convoluted plot.\n\nAside from that, unless you have any idea about crypto currency and forensic accounting (luckily I do, and I was still confused), you'll lose interest in this film pretty fast.\n\nReally too bad considering everything else was done really well. Sadly, it's only a generous 6/10 from me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-04-12","keywords":"corruption,cryptocurrency,wall street,new york,money laundering","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crypto","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4005870617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBiN2M0MTYtZjNlZS00ZWYxLWFiZTYtOGU1M2ViNTIwZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBiN2M0MTYtZjNlZS00ZWYxLWFiZTYtOGU1M2ViNTIwZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3354041/","name":"Beau Knapp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292661/","name":"Luke Hemsworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005007/","name":"Jill Hennessy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1226069/","name":"John Stalberg Jr."}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303286/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0642596/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5673221/","name":"Carlyle Eubank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295701/","name":"David Frigerio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9912021/","name":"Jeff Ingber"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was never made clear what Martins full duty was, or why he left the big city head office, and so on. It's as if a 5+ hour decent screenplay was shredded, and random pieces put together to total the final runtime. I could go on and on, but it's such a shame no one invested in a seasoned screenwriter to at least fine tune the script, as this production had many decent values to it. The pacing was also slow for my liking, and this film needed to be trimmed down to 90 mins (with a proper script) or played back at 1.2x speed.\n\nThe directing/camera work was well executed. The acting by all leads was spot on and convincing, but casting Beau Knapp as Martin was another big mistake. He didn't suit that role/character, and his acting was way too bland. He'd been better off being cast as one of the thugs, instead of pretty much sleeping in his suit trying to act like a white collar exec.\n\nThe score was too outstanding for this film... I mean top notch, and created some great tension and suspense, but seemed overbearing next to the convoluted plot.\n\nAside from that, unless you have any idea about crypto currency and forensic accounting (luckily I do, and I was still confused), you'll lose interest in this film pretty fast.\n\nReally too bad considering everything else was done really well. Sadly, it's only a generous 6/10 from me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-04-12","keywords":"corruption,cryptocurrency,wall street,new york,money laundering","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crypto","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4005870617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBiN2M0MTYtZjNlZS00ZWYxLWFiZTYtOGU1M2ViNTIwZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBiN2M0MTYtZjNlZS00ZWYxLWFiZTYtOGU1M2ViNTIwZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3354041/","name":"Beau Knapp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292661/","name":"Luke Hemsworth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005007/","name":"Jill Hennessy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1226069/","name":"John Stalberg Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303286/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0642596/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5673221/","name":"Carlyle Eubank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295701/","name":"David Frigerio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9912021/","name":"Jeff Ingber"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film is one of those magical examples where they really do. Alfonso Arau has given us one of the most poignant, old-fashioned romance films in many a year. Set in the Napa Valley shortly after the end of World War II, Keanu Reeves and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon play two people searching for their futures. Reeves as an ex-GI in a pointless job with a wife he hardly knows and Sanchez-Gijon as a pregnant and abandoned woman afraid to face the shame she will bring to her family. They agree to pose as a married couple in order for her to save face and placate the anticipated anger of her stern father. What follows is a lovingly realized story of family, love and understanding played out against the beauty of the northern California wine country. The vineyard owned by Sanchez-Gijon's family is pure fantasy created by some wonderful visual effects but it provides the perfect setting for the film. There are moments in this film of sensual beauty every bit as breathtaking as the vineyard itself. One of the great joys of this film is the performance of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, Sanchez-Gijon's grandfather. He steals every scene he's in. His performance is funny and charming and his character always has a knowing twinkle in his eye. A pure delight to watch. For those with unjaded hearts, settle down with the one you love and share a glass of wine as you watch this film and relish it's pure heart and the exquisite joy of it's touching romance."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-08-11","keywords":"falling in love,1940s,aftermath of world war ii,war aftermath,helping someone","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Walk In The Clouds","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3904110873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000206/","name":"Keanu Reeves"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0845209/","name":"Aitana Sánchez-Gijón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000063/","name":"Anthony Quinn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000778/","name":"Alfonso Arau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042359/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588903/","name":"Mark Miller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919386/","name":"Harvey Weitzman"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: A Walk in the Clouds: Directed by Alfonso Arau. With Keanu Reeves, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, Anthony Quinn, Giancarlo Giannini. A married soldier returning from World War II poses as a pregnant woman's husband to save her from her father's anger and honor." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0114887/","name":"A Walk in the Clouds","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ5NzI2NWQtODVjZi00NDk1LTg1NmMtZDVlNWMwODZmNGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_.jpg","description":"A married soldier returning from World War II poses as a pregnant woman's husband to save her from her father's anger and honor.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0114887/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"moviebuff","dateCreated":"2001-02-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"A charming romance for a more cynical time","reviewBody":"You often hear people lament:"they don't make them like they used to". This film is one of those magical examples where they really do. Alfonso Arau has given us one of the most poignant, old-fashioned romance films in many a year. Set in the Napa Valley shortly after the end of World War II, Keanu Reeves and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon play two people searching for their futures. Reeves as an ex-GI in a pointless job with a wife he hardly knows and Sanchez-Gijon as a pregnant and abandoned woman afraid to face the shame she will bring to her family. They agree to pose as a married couple in order for her to save face and placate the anticipated anger of her stern father. What follows is a lovingly realized story of family, love and understanding played out against the beauty of the northern California wine country. The vineyard owned by Sanchez-Gijon's family is pure fantasy created by some wonderful visual effects but it provides the perfect setting for the film. There are moments in this film of sensual beauty every bit as breathtaking as the vineyard itself. One of the great joys of this film is the performance of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, Sanchez-Gijon's grandfather. He steals every scene he's in. His performance is funny and charming and his character always has a knowing twinkle in his eye. A pure delight to watch. For those with unjaded hearts, settle down with the one you love and share a glass of wine as you watch this film and relish it's pure heart and the exquisite joy of it's touching romance.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-08-11","keywords":"falling in love,1940s,aftermath of world war ii,war aftermath,helping someone","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Walk In The Clouds","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3904110873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000206/","name":"Keanu Reeves","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0845209/","name":"Aitana Sánchez-Gijón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000063/","name":"Anthony Quinn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000778/","name":"Alfonso Arau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042359/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588903/","name":"Mark Miller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919386/","name":"Harvey Weitzman"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film is one of those magical examples where they really do. Alfonso Arau has given us one of the most poignant, old-fashioned romance films in many a year. Set in the Napa Valley shortly after the end of World War II, Keanu Reeves and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon play two people searching for their futures. Reeves as an ex-GI in a pointless job with a wife he hardly knows and Sanchez-Gijon as a pregnant and abandoned woman afraid to face the shame she will bring to her family. They agree to pose as a married couple in order for her to save face and placate the anticipated anger of her stern father. What follows is a lovingly realized story of family, love and understanding played out against the beauty of the northern California wine country. The vineyard owned by Sanchez-Gijon's family is pure fantasy created by some wonderful visual effects but it provides the perfect setting for the film. There are moments in this film of sensual beauty every bit as breathtaking as the vineyard itself. One of the great joys of this film is the performance of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, Sanchez-Gijon's grandfather. He steals every scene he's in. His performance is funny and charming and his character always has a knowing twinkle in his eye. A pure delight to watch. For those with unjaded hearts, settle down with the one you love and share a glass of wine as you watch this film and relish it's pure heart and the exquisite joy of it's touching romance."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-08-11","keywords":"falling in love,1940s,aftermath of world war ii,war aftermath,helping someone","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Walk In The Clouds","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3904110873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000206/","name":"Keanu Reeves"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0845209/","name":"Aitana Sánchez-Gijón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000063/","name":"Anthony Quinn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000778/","name":"Alfonso Arau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042359/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588903/","name":"Mark Miller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919386/","name":"Harvey Weitzman"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film is one of those magical examples where they really do. Alfonso Arau has given us one of the most poignant, old-fashioned romance films in many a year. Set in the Napa Valley shortly after the end of World War II, Keanu Reeves and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon play two people searching for their futures. Reeves as an ex-GI in a pointless job with a wife he hardly knows and Sanchez-Gijon as a pregnant and abandoned woman afraid to face the shame she will bring to her family. They agree to pose as a married couple in order for her to save face and placate the anticipated anger of her stern father. What follows is a lovingly realized story of family, love and understanding played out against the beauty of the northern California wine country. The vineyard owned by Sanchez-Gijon's family is pure fantasy created by some wonderful visual effects but it provides the perfect setting for the film. There are moments in this film of sensual beauty every bit as breathtaking as the vineyard itself. One of the great joys of this film is the performance of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, Sanchez-Gijon's grandfather. He steals every scene he's in. His performance is funny and charming and his character always has a knowing twinkle in his eye. A pure delight to watch. For those with unjaded hearts, settle down with the one you love and share a glass of wine as you watch this film and relish it's pure heart and the exquisite joy of it's touching romance.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-08-11","keywords":"falling in love,1940s,aftermath of world war ii,war aftermath,helping someone","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Walk In The Clouds","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3904110873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FlOTU3OGUtZjZkZC00ZjRjLTljMWMtMTVkNDg2MmVlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000206/","name":"Keanu Reeves","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0845209/","name":"Aitana Sánchez-Gijón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000063/","name":"Anthony Quinn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000778/","name":"Alfonso Arau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042359/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588903/","name":"Mark Miller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919386/","name":"Harvey Weitzman"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film "The Shindler's List" and instead filmed "The Pianist". We should be very grateful to film authors. PS - People who give this film a low rating obviously have not seen it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-08-20","keywords":"childhood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1058543/","name":"Ryszard Horowitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7061785/","name":"Bronislawa Horowitz Karakulska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0701909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But it is just the opposite. While Adam (Charlie Plummer) starts a relationship with the bright girl in class after he asks her to tutor him, the story is overwhelmingly about Adam, and his family, and ultimately his school coming to grips with his schizophrenia.\n\nPlummer is required to really stretch his acting chops and he does it well.

But it is just the opposite. While Adam (Charlie Plummer) starts a relationship with the bright girl in class after he asks her to tutor him, the story is overwhelmingly about Adam, and his family, and ultimately his school coming to grips with his schizophrenia.\n\nPlummer is required to really stretch his acting chops and he does it well. The middle third of the movie is hard to watch at times but fortunately the final third starts to bring some healing.\n\nGood movie, my wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7600,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-08-21","keywords":"based on young adult novel,schizophrenia,hallucination,hospital,restraint","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3428105753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A teenager coping with paranoid schizophrenia hopes his new experimental drug treatment will help him navigate high school and the outside world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4055138/","name":"Charlie Plummer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5347988/","name":"Taylor Russell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294457/","name":"Thor Freudenthal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0811450/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0192696/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4550950/","name":"Nick Naveda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9649443/","name":"Julia Walton"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful, often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny; it's even occasionally hilarious.\n\nThe problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers, it's not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.\n\nThe story, which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Casino Royale (published in 1953--it's the first Bond novel), is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond (David Niven) went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we know--he is almost chaste, he's a homebody, he dedicates each evening's twilight to playing Debussy on the piano, and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.\n\nA group of older men, representing the secret agencies of the US, the UK, Russia and France, are on their way to the real Bond's home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they're pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond, they're attacked. Bond's house is blown up, and he (implicitly) agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agent-wipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bond--if the real Bond is to work unimpeded, he can't always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.\n\nEach director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions (the production company behind most of the Bond films) not owning the rights to Casino Royale, they had used many of the "bits" in other Bond films. So there wasn't much of the book left to adapt. In addition, it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn't compete against the Albert R. Broccoli/Harry Saltzman-produced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler, John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writer/director teams create their own, parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied together--it was almost a filmic version of the "Exquisite Corpse" game, in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can't see other persons' work, and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.\n\nEach segment features a different set of stars--the primary sets centering on Niven, Woody Allen, and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors, and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtick--in some cases, they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character, Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy, with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure, Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Wine-pitching "elder statesman" demeanor, and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good, but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that's not enough evidence for you, consider that the segments were further chopped up into set-pieces. There's the "M", or McTarry funeral stuff, the Niven car chase stuff, the Sellers/Andress romance stuff, and so on. Each set piece ends up being largely independent--you could almost see this as a series of skits on a similar theme. These facts make Casino Royale not quite work. It's certainly no match for a legitimate Bond film, despite the similarity of location-hopping, outrageous villains, spy gadgets and so on.\n\nBut, in isolation, the segments tend to be good to excellent. The stretch with Bond visiting the faux M widow is probably the funniest. It also presages the Sir Robin section of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), but bests it in a way, if only because of its extension. The madcap ending of the film is a lot of fun for its embrace of absurdism as a supreme aesthetic disposition--and it may have even influenced some later films. And the segments with the trippiest visuals, both in the climax, are a fantastic treat for any fan of surrealism. They're good enough to watch the film just to see them. The production design is incredible throughout the film. Not just for the surrealism, but the lush Edwardian and Victorian interiors, complete with copies and works in similar styles to unique, influential artists such as Gustav Klimt and Otto Dix.\n\nIf we felt like being overly generous, we might be able to argue that the overarching mess of a plot was part of the point. This is a spoof of Bond, after all, and Bond novels and films tend to have sprawling plots--both geographically and narratively. We do travel to many exotic locales, meet many exotic people, doing exotic things, and we receive many plot intricacies and twists in both the typical Bond story and in Casino Royale. However, Bond films aren't quite convoluted or messy enough to deserve this kind of spoofing, so excusing the messiness of the whole to parodic intent seems an over-ambitious stretch.\n\nCasino Royale is worth seeing, particularly if you're a big Bond fan or a big fan of any of the cast, or even if you just like a lot of late 1960s/early 1970s big, madcap comedies. Just don't expect anything like a tight story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1967-04-23","keywords":"spy spoof,james bond spoof,parody,007,spy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi889568793","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000057/","name":"David Niven"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000634/","name":"Peter Sellers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000266/","name":"Ursula Andress"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0346436/","name":"Val Guest"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001379/","name":"John Huston"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077420/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542554/","name":"Wolf Mankowitz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492339/","name":"John Law"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0768476/","name":"Michael Sayers"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also presages the Sir Robin section of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), but bests it in a way, if only because of its extension. The madcap ending of the film is a lot of fun for its embrace of absurdism as a supreme aesthetic disposition--and it may have even influenced some later films. And the segments with the trippiest visuals, both in the climax, are a fantastic treat for any fan of surrealism. They're good enough to watch the film just to see them. The production design is incredible throughout the film. Not just for the surrealism, but the lush Edwardian and Victorian interiors, complete with copies and works in similar styles to unique, influential artists such as Gustav Klimt and Otto Dix.\n\nIf we felt like being overly generous, we might be able to argue that the overarching mess of a plot was part of the point. This is a spoof of Bond, after all, and Bond novels and films tend to have sprawling plots--both geographically and narratively. We do travel to many exotic locales, meet many exotic people, doing exotic things, and we receive many plot intricacies and twists in both the typical Bond story and in Casino Royale. However, Bond films aren't quite convoluted or messy enough to deserve this kind of spoofing, so excusing the messiness of the whole to parodic intent seems an over-ambitious stretch.\n\nCasino Royale is worth seeing, particularly if you're a big Bond fan or a big fan of any of the cast, or even if you just like a lot of late 1960s/early 1970s big, madcap comedies. Just don't expect anything like a tight story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1967-04-23","keywords":"spy spoof,james bond spoof,parody,007,spy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi889568793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000057/","name":"David Niven","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000634/","name":"Peter Sellers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000266/","name":"Ursula Andress"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0346436/","name":"Val Guest","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001379/","name":"John Huston"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077420/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542554/","name":"Wolf Mankowitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492339/","name":"John Law","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0768476/","name":"Michael Sayers"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful, often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny; it's even occasionally hilarious.\n\nThe problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers, it's not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.\n\nThe story, which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Casino Royale (published in 1953--it's the first Bond novel), is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond (David Niven) went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we know--he is almost chaste, he's a homebody, he dedicates each evening's twilight to playing Debussy on the piano, and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.\n\nA group of older men, representing the secret agencies of the US, the UK, Russia and France, are on their way to the real Bond's home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they're pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond, they're attacked. Bond's house is blown up, and he (implicitly) agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agent-wipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bond--if the real Bond is to work unimpeded, he can't always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.\n\nEach director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions (the production company behind most of the Bond films) not owning the rights to Casino Royale, they had used many of the "bits" in other Bond films. So there wasn't much of the book left to adapt. In addition, it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn't compete against the Albert R. Broccoli/Harry Saltzman-produced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler, John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writer/director teams create their own, parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied together--it was almost a filmic version of the "Exquisite Corpse" game, in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can't see other persons' work, and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.\n\nEach segment features a different set of stars--the primary sets centering on Niven, Woody Allen, and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors, and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtick--in some cases, they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character, Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy, with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure, Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Wine-pitching "elder statesman" demeanor, and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good, but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that's not enough evidence for you, consider that the segments were further chopped up into set-pieces. There's the "M", or McTarry funeral stuff, the Niven car chase stuff, the Sellers/Andress romance stuff, and so on. Each set piece ends up being largely independent--you could almost see this as a series of skits on a similar theme. These facts make Casino Royale not quite work. It's certainly no match for a legitimate Bond film, despite the similarity of location-hopping, outrageous villains, spy gadgets and so on.\n\nBut, in isolation, the segments tend to be good to excellent. The stretch with Bond visiting the faux M widow is probably the funniest. It also presages the Sir Robin section of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), but bests it in a way, if only because of its extension. The madcap ending of the film is a lot of fun for its embrace of absurdism as a supreme aesthetic disposition--and it may have even influenced some later films. And the segments with the trippiest visuals, both in the climax, are a fantastic treat for any fan of surrealism. They're good enough to watch the film just to see them. The production design is incredible throughout the film. Not just for the surrealism, but the lush Edwardian and Victorian interiors, complete with copies and works in similar styles to unique, influential artists such as Gustav Klimt and Otto Dix.\n\nIf we felt like being overly generous, we might be able to argue that the overarching mess of a plot was part of the point. This is a spoof of Bond, after all, and Bond novels and films tend to have sprawling plots--both geographically and narratively. We do travel to many exotic locales, meet many exotic people, doing exotic things, and we receive many plot intricacies and twists in both the typical Bond story and in Casino Royale. However, Bond films aren't quite convoluted or messy enough to deserve this kind of spoofing, so excusing the messiness of the whole to parodic intent seems an over-ambitious stretch.\n\nCasino Royale is worth seeing, particularly if you're a big Bond fan or a big fan of any of the cast, or even if you just like a lot of late 1960s/early 1970s big, madcap comedies. Just don't expect anything like a tight story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1967-04-23","keywords":"spy spoof,james bond spoof,parody,007,spy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi889568793","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000057/","name":"David Niven"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000634/","name":"Peter Sellers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000266/","name":"Ursula Andress"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0346436/","name":"Val Guest"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001379/","name":"John Huston"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077420/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542554/","name":"Wolf Mankowitz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492339/","name":"John Law"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0768476/","name":"Michael Sayers"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful, often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny; it's even occasionally hilarious.\n\nThe problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers, it's not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.\n\nThe story, which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Casino Royale (published in 1953--it's the first Bond novel), is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond (David Niven) went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we know--he is almost chaste, he's a homebody, he dedicates each evening's twilight to playing Debussy on the piano, and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.\n\nA group of older men, representing the secret agencies of the US, the UK, Russia and France, are on their way to the real Bond's home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they're pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond, they're attacked. Bond's house is blown up, and he (implicitly) agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agent-wipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bond--if the real Bond is to work unimpeded, he can't always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.\n\nEach director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions (the production company behind most of the Bond films) not owning the rights to Casino Royale, they had used many of the "bits" in other Bond films. So there wasn't much of the book left to adapt. In addition, it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn't compete against the Albert R. Broccoli/Harry Saltzman-produced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler, John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writer/director teams create their own, parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied together--it was almost a filmic version of the "Exquisite Corpse" game, in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can't see other persons' work, and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.\n\nEach segment features a different set of stars--the primary sets centering on Niven, Woody Allen, and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors, and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtick--in some cases, they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character, Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy, with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure, Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Wine-pitching "elder statesman" demeanor, and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good, but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that's not enough evidence for you, consider that the segments were further chopped up into set-pieces. There's the "M", or McTarry funeral stuff, the Niven car chase stuff, the Sellers/Andress romance stuff, and so on. Each set piece ends up being largely independent--you could almost see this as a series of skits on a similar theme. These facts make Casino Royale not quite work. It's certainly no match for a legitimate Bond film, despite the similarity of location-hopping, outrageous villains, spy gadgets and so on.\n\nBut, in isolation, the segments tend to be good to excellent. The stretch with Bond visiting the faux M widow is probably the funniest. It also presages the Sir Robin section of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), but bests it in a way, if only because of its extension. The madcap ending of the film is a lot of fun for its embrace of absurdism as a supreme aesthetic disposition--and it may have even influenced some later films. And the segments with the trippiest visuals, both in the climax, are a fantastic treat for any fan of surrealism. They're good enough to watch the film just to see them. The production design is incredible throughout the film. Not just for the surrealism, but the lush Edwardian and Victorian interiors, complete with copies and works in similar styles to unique, influential artists such as Gustav Klimt and Otto Dix.\n\nIf we felt like being overly generous, we might be able to argue that the overarching mess of a plot was part of the point. This is a spoof of Bond, after all, and Bond novels and films tend to have sprawling plots--both geographically and narratively. We do travel to many exotic locales, meet many exotic people, doing exotic things, and we receive many plot intricacies and twists in both the typical Bond story and in Casino Royale. However, Bond films aren't quite convoluted or messy enough to deserve this kind of spoofing, so excusing the messiness of the whole to parodic intent seems an over-ambitious stretch.\n\nCasino Royale is worth seeing, particularly if you're a big Bond fan or a big fan of any of the cast, or even if you just like a lot of late 1960s/early 1970s big, madcap comedies. Just don't expect anything like a tight story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1967-04-23","keywords":"spy spoof,james bond spoof,parody,007,spy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi889568793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNzZlYzUtYzljMy00Y2M4LWEzZDMtMDY4YjY0YjZkMTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000057/","name":"David Niven","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000634/","name":"Peter Sellers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000266/","name":"Ursula Andress"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0346436/","name":"Val Guest","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001379/","name":"John Huston"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077420/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542554/","name":"Wolf Mankowitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492339/","name":"John Law","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0768476/","name":"Michael Sayers"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":887814,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-03-06","keywords":"mathematician,schizophrenia,mental illness,nobel prize,game theory","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1801239321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNkYzBiMTgtOTRkOS00ZTAyLTkyZjItMWY0YjE5MjJhYzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNkYzBiMTgtOTRkOS00ZTAyLTkyZjItMWY0YjE5MjJhYzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0621586/","name":"Sylvia Nasar"],"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has its moments of "belt-in- the-face" fun, but they are consistently grounded in the real problems the lead characters face -- unemployment, loss of family, lack of self-respect, fear of ridicule and a bleak future that promises even greater failure.  This is not a Farrelly Brothers kind of story...and that is what makes it so special.\n\nGaz is broke, on welfare, lives in the projects, is behind on his child support and is threatened with losing his son to his ex-wife unless he can pull together 700 pounds (about $1100).  But this is Sheffield, England -- once a boomtown but now a deadening city of shopping malls and garment mills, where the factories (and the guys that worked in them) are empty shells of themselves.  The women have jobs; the men have job fairs.  Into this comes a touring "Chippendale's" dance troupe (aimed at women only; after all, they have the spare money) and an idea is born.  Gaz and some mates will strip all the way, give the ladies "the full monty", as a way to earn some quick change.\n\nThe idea is preposterous.  Only one of the six men in the new dance troupe is good-looking enough to pull it off (pun intended); the rest are either fat, skinny, old and/or ugly.  But the movie's gentle suggestion is that not only is beauty in the eye of the beholder, but so is self-respect...and in following through with their plans, they gain a LOT more than just 2000 pounds each.\n\nRobert Carlyle is good as the anchor of the piece, always pushing and planning and cajoling and begging and even stealing, as need be, but it's the rest of the cast that makes this movie work -- from Tom Wilkinson as a manager ashamed to tell his wife he's lost his job to Mark Addy as a man who's so ashamed of how fat and unattractive he is, he's driving his wife away right down to Hugo Speer and his joyful "let's have a blast" attitude.\n\n"The Full Monty" is a gem of human comedy aimed not at the gut but at the sense of hope we all carry.  I recommend it for anyone who needs a lift."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103288,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-08-29","keywords":"unemployment,male stripper,northern england,working class,england","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Full Monty","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi395116825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJhOTk1ZjQtOGQyMC00NzcxLTg1ZTctYjA3ZTllMzA1MmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJhOTk1ZjQtOGQyMC00NzcxLTg1ZTctYjA3ZTllMzA1MmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Fox Searchlight Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001015/","name":"Robert Carlyle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929489/","name":"Tom Wilkinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004692/","name":"Mark Addy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146341/","name":"Peter Cattaneo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065001/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103532/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has its moments of "belt-in- the-face" fun, but they are consistently grounded in the real problems the lead characters face -- unemployment, loss of family, lack of self-respect, fear of ridicule and a bleak future that promises even greater failure.  This is not a Farrelly Brothers kind of story...and that is what makes it so special.\n\nGaz is broke, on welfare, lives in the projects, is behind on his child support and is threatened with losing his son to his ex-wife unless he can pull together 700 pounds (about $1100).  But this is Sheffield, England -- once a boomtown but now a deadening city of shopping malls and garment mills, where the factories (and the guys that worked in them) are empty shells of themselves.  The women have jobs; the men have job fairs.  Into this comes a touring "Chippendale's" dance troupe (aimed at women only; after all, they have the spare money) and an idea is born.  Gaz and some mates will strip all the way, give the ladies "the full monty", as a way to earn some quick change.\n\nThe idea is preposterous.  Only one of the six men in the new dance troupe is good-looking enough to pull it off (pun intended); the rest are either fat, skinny, old and/or ugly.  But the movie's gentle suggestion is that not only is beauty in the eye of the beholder, but so is self-respect...and in following through with their plans, they gain a LOT more than just 2000 pounds each.\n\nRobert Carlyle is good as the anchor of the piece, always pushing and planning and cajoling and begging and even stealing, as need be, but it's the rest of the cast that makes this movie work -- from Tom Wilkinson as a manager ashamed to tell his wife he's lost his job to Mark Addy as a man who's so ashamed of how fat and unattractive he is, he's driving his wife away right down to Hugo Speer and his joyful "let's have a blast" attitude.\n\n"The Full Monty" is a gem of human comedy aimed not at the gut but at the sense of hope we all carry.  I recommend it for anyone who needs a lift.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103288,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-08-29","keywords":"unemployment,male stripper,northern england,working class,england","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Full Monty","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi395116825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJhOTk1ZjQtOGQyMC00NzcxLTg1ZTctYjA3ZTllMzA1MmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJhOTk1ZjQtOGQyMC00NzcxLTg1ZTctYjA3ZTllMzA1MmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Fox Searchlight Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001015/","name":"Robert Carlyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929489/","name":"Tom Wilkinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004692/","name":"Mark Addy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146341/","name":"Peter Cattaneo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065001/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103532/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has its moments of "belt-in- the-face" fun, but they are consistently grounded in the real problems the lead characters face -- unemployment, loss of family, lack of self-respect, fear of ridicule and a bleak future that promises even greater failure.  This is not a Farrelly Brothers kind of story...and that is what makes it so special.\n\nGaz is broke, on welfare, lives in the projects, is behind on his child support and is threatened with losing his son to his ex-wife unless he can pull together 700 pounds (about $1100).  But this is Sheffield, England -- once a boomtown but now a deadening city of shopping malls and garment mills, where the factories (and the guys that worked in them) are empty shells of themselves.  The women have jobs; the men have job fairs.  Into this comes a touring "Chippendale's" dance troupe (aimed at women only; after all, they have the spare money) and an idea is born.  Gaz and some mates will strip all the way, give the ladies "the full monty", as a way to earn some quick change.\n\nThe idea is preposterous.  Only one of the six men in the new dance troupe is good-looking enough to pull it off (pun intended); the rest are either fat, skinny, old and/or ugly.  But the movie's gentle suggestion is that not only is beauty in the eye of the beholder, but so is self-respect...and in following through with their plans, they gain a LOT more than just 2000 pounds each.\n\nRobert Carlyle is good as the anchor of the piece, always pushing and planning and cajoling and begging and even stealing, as need be, but it's the rest of the cast that makes this movie work -- from Tom Wilkinson as a manager ashamed to tell his wife he's lost his job to Mark Addy as a man who's so ashamed of how fat and unattractive he is, he's driving his wife away right down to Hugo Speer and his joyful "let's have a blast" attitude.\n\n"The Full Monty" is a gem of human comedy aimed not at the gut but at the sense of hope we all carry.

Although not my favorite Tanantino film, it's still really great! If you've seen any of his previous work you know exactly what to expect. Inglorious Basterds does some masterful buildup. It all builds up to that finale, which is satisfying and so worth the 2 hour wait.

He does not have a great relationship with his mum Sue, who, despite having a sunny disposition and cheery manner is also painfully unsure of herself. Daniel is hoping to spend the summer with his father who is now living in Florida but when that plan is scuppered it's clear that he's going to have to spend it with his mother.\n\nTo say this film is understated is....well, an understatement.

The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book. By the time the "injustice" takes place I was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by Knightley and McAvoy's liaison. Their love story is left to its own devices. The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, "Pride and Prejudice" keeps you going. The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see "Atonement" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265210,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-01-23","keywords":"world war two,rape,false accusation,sex,loss of virginity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Atonement","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836805401","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Atonement trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564215/","name":"James McAvoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358960/","name":"Christopher Hampton"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book. By the time the "injustice" takes place I was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by Knightley and McAvoy's liaison. Their love story is left to its own devices. The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, "Pride and Prejudice" keeps you going. The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see "Atonement" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265210,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-01-23","keywords":"world war two,rape,false accusation,sex,loss of virginity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Atonement","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836805401","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Atonement trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564215/","name":"James McAvoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358960/","name":"Christopher Hampton"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.\n\nCal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.\n\nThe intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.\n\nAfter moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.\n\nThe polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood - these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that's just the stuff I can tell you! Cal's first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual, Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton, but it's interesting to note (in real life) she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).\n\nAll of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey). Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that, it's on to the new Spider-Man for her.\n\nGlenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman, who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.\n\nNo question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men will relate to what's going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":495148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-29","keywords":"divorce,marriage,unfaithfulness,adultery,marital problem","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3722091801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Newly single Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is taken on as wingman and protÃ©gÃ© to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).

The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.\n\nBased on a short story by futurist Phillip K.

The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.\n\nBased on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration.

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze. In a part equally poorly written, she made far more of her scenes than the writers gave her. \n\nThe most interesting character in the film was certainly Rick Yune, as Graves' 'enforcer', Zao.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A very forgettable and hollow version of the story.\n\nOh and Beyoncé over sings everything.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":229055,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-07-19","keywords":"remake of remake,lion,remake,africa,king","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lion King","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3509369881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE0NTMyZmMtOGQ2YS00MGZkLThkYjItZWRhMzYwMzRkZjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE0NTMyZmMtOGQ2YS00MGZkLThkYjItZWRhMzYwMzRkZjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2255973/","name":"Donald Glover","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461498/","name":"Beyoncé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269463/","name":"Jon Favreau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008347/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0091919/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0575293/","name":"Irene Mecchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0731271/","name":"Jonathan Roberts"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3315342/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"trublu215"},"dateCreated":"2017-02-23","inLanguage":"English","name":"If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.","reviewBody":"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura.

But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3315342/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"trublu215","dateCreated":"2017-02-23","inLanguage":"English","name":"If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.","reviewBody":"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Though most of the situations here are so old they have lichens growing on them, director John Dahl and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely put enough fresh spins on them as to make this movie a pleasant time-filler, even though Wilson's character is yet another one of those annoying parts in which we're told he's Gay but we never actually see him romantically or sexually involved with a man.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18306,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-07-13","keywords":"untrustworthiness,watching tv,friend,contemplating suicide,crying","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You Kill Me","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi249757977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc2OTkwNGItYzIxMy00YzMwLTlkYzEtYTMwYTc3MGY3YTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc2OTkwNGItYzIxMy00YzMwLTlkYzEtYTMwYTc3MGY3YTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from IFC","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005561/","name":"Luke Wilson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001093/","name":"John Dahl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143069/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208303/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1321655/","name":"Christopher Markus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1321656/","name":"Stephen McFeely"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is about a boy who goes to live with his grandparents and his cousin, there he faces the nightmares of his cousin with the help of his costumes. Quality. Animation is good. At times it is parsimonious and it feels like it is not moving forward. Exaggerated imagination but that is consistent to catch the child audience. Colorful Talk about friendship, about being yourself, about overcoming fears (nightmares). Nice Sunday. What happens in the credits are or better, it leaves a great taste in your mouth.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Animation"],"datePublished":"2020-09-03","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2162529/","name":"Paty Cantú","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519980/","name":"Fran Fernández","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7053597/","name":"Cristina Hernandez"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5899857/","name":"Eduardo Rivero"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0566681/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855084/","name":"Miguel Ángel Uriegas"],"duration":"PT1H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even with two cameo's this movie didn't make the heist.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":204245,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-06-08","keywords":"released from jail,female protagonist,hacker,vomiting,diamond necklace","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135459097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI1YTI3Y2UtNTRmNy00OWNiLWJjOTQtMjU3ZWFlNzIzNjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWZlZGVyaWdh._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI1YTI3Y2UtNTRmNy00OWNiLWJjOTQtMjU3ZWFlNzIzNjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWZlZGVyaWdh._V1_.jpg","description":"Debbie Ocean gathers a crew to attempt an impossible heist at New York City's yearly Met Gala.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002657/","name":"Gary Ross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0702052/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002657/","name":"Gary Ross","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6035700/","name":"Olivia Milch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.\n\nChanning Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.\n\nLike Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.\n\nAs du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.\n\nFoxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.\n\nHis worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number.

A bizarre side-note, I know.\n\nAs the movie builds to a climax, the police are hunting for Max, believing he is the one on a killing spree, and Vincent stalks his final victim in a blacked-out high-rise office to a backdrop of the brilliant LA skyline, reflected in multiplicity by the office's dozens of glass cubicles.\n\nTom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith all rise to the occasion in Collateral, and together they transcend their previous appearances on film. Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.\n\nThere are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.\n\nTroy Dayton","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":381969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"los angeles california,taxi driver,taxi,contract killer,driving at night","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Collateral","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi448725273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":359208,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

On an island off the coast of North America, local residents simultaneously fight a zombie epidemic while hoping for a cure to return their un-dead relatives back to their human state." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1134854/","name":"Survival of the Dead","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE1NDMxMDAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgzNDcyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On an island off the coast of North America, local residents simultaneously fight a zombie epidemic while hoping for a cure to return their un-dead relatives back to their human state.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1134854/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"TdSmth5"},"dateCreated":"2011-09-26","inLanguage":"English","name":"Another great Romero zombie flick","reviewBody":"A military group that has turned into bandits during the zombie infestation decides to follow an online infomercial and tries to make it to the peaceful island it promises. At the harbor they realize they have been ambushed by the guy pitching the island. He robs the potential clients and dumps them on the island, which is nothing but zombie-free.\n\nEarlier in the movie we meet this guy O'Flynn, a fisherman on the island. He's runs one of the two Irish clans on the island. His nemesis is Seamus. When zombies infest the island, O'Flynn opts to eliminate them all while Seamus wants to keep them "alive" and chained. They kick O'Flynn of the island leaving his daughter behind.\n\nNow the military guys make it to the island followed by O'Flynn who sees this as an opportunity to avenge himself from Seamus. They find that Seamus is trying to domesticate the zombies, enchained and treated like cattle or horses. His special project is trying to teach zombies to eat animal meat and not human. So far he has been unsuccessful.\n\nEventually we have the confrontation between the two clans plus the zombies in a bloody and brutal outcome.\n\nAs all Romero movies, this one is smart, sometimes funny and with plenty of zombie violence. Even what should be a lame scene, Romero manages to make it interesting. He's particularly good as showing human interaction.

 --- Description: Survival of the Dead: Directed by George A. Romero. With Alan Van Sprang, Joshua Peace, Hardee T. Lineham, Dru Viergever. On an island off the coast of North America, local residents simultaneously fight a zombie epidemic while hoping for a cure to return their un-dead relatives back to their human state." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1134854/","name":"Survival of the Dead","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE1NDMxMDAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgzNDcyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On an island off the coast of North America, local residents simultaneously fight a zombie epidemic while hoping for a cure to return their un-dead relatives back to their human state.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1134854/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"TdSmth5","dateCreated":"2011-09-26","inLanguage":"English","name":"Another great Romero zombie flick","reviewBody":"A military group that has turned into bandits during the zombie infestation decides to follow an online infomercial and tries to make it to the peaceful island it promises. At the harbor they realize they have been ambushed by the guy pitching the island. He robs the potential clients and dumps them on the island, which is nothing but zombie-free.\n\nEarlier in the movie we meet this guy O'Flynn, a fisherman on the island. He's runs one of the two Irish clans on the island. His nemesis is Seamus. When zombies infest the island, O'Flynn opts to eliminate them all while Seamus wants to keep them "alive" and chained. They kick O'Flynn of the island leaving his daughter behind.\n\nNow the military guys make it to the island followed by O'Flynn who sees this as an opportunity to avenge himself from Seamus. They find that Seamus is trying to domesticate the zombies, enchained and treated like cattle or horses. His special project is trying to teach zombies to eat animal meat and not human. So far he has been unsuccessful.\n\nEventually we have the confrontation between the two clans plus the zombies in a bloody and brutal outcome.\n\nAs all Romero movies, this one is smart, sometimes funny and with plenty of zombie violence. Even what should be a lame scene, Romero manages to make it interesting. He's particularly good as showing human interaction. And of course there is the usual criticism of human inhumanity in how they treat the zombies. The last minutes are particularly entertaining for those who are into gore. The only problem I have with this movie is that the final zombie mayhem is presented as a comedy. It's unnecessary and doesn't suit the violent tone of the content. Otherwise this is classic Romero in a quickly paced and gory zombie movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21158,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2010-05-06","keywords":"2000s,grindhouse film,midnight movie,four word title,biopunk","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Survival of the Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1563035417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NDA2MDk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE3NTI0Mw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NDA2MDk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE3NTI0Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"National Guardsmen, thinking they have found refuge from a zombie army on an island off the coast of Delaware, soon realize they've wedged themselves between two warring families who differ on what should become of the undead.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888022/","name":"Alan Van Sprang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0920564/","name":"Kenneth Welsh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1182008/","name":"Kathleen Munroe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

I recommend this movie to fans of drama and comedy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-01-24","keywords":"bitter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Elsewhere","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1762246425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDNhODY5YWItZWI0OC00MWU3LTgwNGUtNzI5N2ZjMDIwY2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDNhODY5YWItZWI0OC00MWU3LTgwNGUtNzI5N2ZjMDIwY2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949237/","name":"Aden Young","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000205/","name":"Parker Posey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421822/","name":"Ken Jeong"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2076099/","name":"Hernan Jimenez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577319/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0260861/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065717/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2076099/","name":"Hernan Jimenez"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The reviewer who likened her performance to that of Roger Moore does not, I would suggest, appreciate either the characterisation of the Nanny McPhee role (much can be, and is, portrayed by simple facial expressions) or the very real acting ability of our erstwhile Bond. Comedy isn't all about snappy one-liners and the ability to convey comedy simply by saying nothing is an art in and of itself.\n\nIn the final analysis, this is a better film than its predecessor.

Seldom have I seen such a fun programme. Yes, fun. This was funny, sexy, violent, bonkers and emotionally truthful in a way that other series fail to achieve.\n\nTo think that this was aiming for any kind of historical accuracy is mad. It was made as an entertainment riffing on possible historical events. The use of modern language, initially jarring, ends up working to its advantage. There's no more reason to dislike modern usage than there is to dislike cod medieval or cod turn of the millennia language. Any language choice is going to be inauthentic so you might as well go for modern vernacular which has the side effect of milking the dialogue for humour. Using Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man for the theme tune is as inspired as using Nick Cave for the theme tune of Peaky Blinders. \n\nYou might also like to note the satirical reference to other well-known franchises and the use of Shakespearian minor characters. The two centurions sampling the "stash" of the witch doctor was comedy gold.\n\nYes, how we all hunger for the certainty of the old days when you knew where you were. When Loved It or Hated It reviews could be searched on and all TV programmes followed the same rules and were as bland as each other. Now all we have left is "helpful" so please regard this review as a provocative Loved It review. No, seriously, I really loved this series and can't wait for the next and I hope I've been really unhelpful in my review.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14253,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-01-18","keywords":"soldier,roman army,roman conquest of britain,druid,female warrior","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607375/","name":"David Morrissey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5732956/","name":"Eleanor Worthington-Cox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722279/","name":"Julian Rhind-Tutt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165439/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050995/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125358/","name":"Tom Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724597/","name":"James Richardson"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Britannia: Ready","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3585458457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJmZTFiNjUtYmI4MS00NzcwLTlmZDctNDkzYTc0Mzk3MjNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJmZTFiNjUtYmI4MS00NzcwLTlmZDctNDkzYTc0Mzk3MjNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Britannia: Ready"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you like the comedy style of Jim Carey and movement of Lee Evans or Rowan Atkinson then I recommend you give this a go.\n\nEnjoy","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39005,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1996-02-02","keywords":"clumsiness,embarrassment,political campaign,politics,crooked politician","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3586310425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","description":"A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000394/","name":"Chris Farley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005450/","name":"David Spade","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001513/","name":"Tim Matheson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790715/","name":"Penelope Spheeris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.\n\nThen the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).\n\nAlicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.\n\nFor me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick. It's a highly entertaining satire and it's a nuanced teen comedy with a subtle social comment."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-07-19","keywords":"high school,valley girl,female protagonist,makeover,popularity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Clueless","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi993050137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxMDM5MTAtZTMzMy00NGRiLWE1ZmUtZjMwMzA1MGM4Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxMDM5MTAtZTMzMy00NGRiLWE1ZmUtZjMwMzA1MGM4Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000224/","name":"Alicia Silverstone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001107/","name":"Stacey Dash"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Instead Of "Apollo Creed" or "Mr. T.," we now have "Ivan Drago,"(Dolph Lundgren) a giant Russian who is more like a machine. He's "indestructable" (and on steroids, too, and unlike some baseball slugger, he admits it!). He has the latest in technology, nutrition, etc., but you just know the much-smaller disadvantaged hero "Rocky Balboa" (Sylvester Stallone) will somehow find a way to chop this "Goliath" down.\n\nMinute-for-minute, this might be the most entertaining of all the Rocky films, and looks good on DVD despite some graininess in the first five minutes. Rocky's wife "Adrian" (Talia Shire) never looked better: mature and pretty; the gruff and profane manager played Burgess Meredith is gone and the repellent obnoxious slob "Paulie" (Burt Young) has only a few lines. \n\nThis is the ultimate "David vs. Goliath" tale in every aspect and the final bout - held in Russia - breaks the all-time Rocky record for most punches ever thrown at two fighters. Of course, any real-life human would have been knocked cold about 50 times had they suffered the blows "Rocky" did in this fight! \n\nThis is a real flag-waving film with Rocky draping the Stars and Stripes around his shoulders. It's a totally unrealistic story but, all of these in the series were similar, credibility-wise, so just go along with it and enjoy the story. It's only an hour-and-a-half and story literally flies by.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1985-11-27","keywords":"training montage,boxing,coming out of retirement,cutting down a tree,loss of friend","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky IV","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3266298649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Instead Of "Apollo Creed" or "Mr. T.," we now have "Ivan Drago,"(Dolph Lundgren) a giant Russian who is more like a machine. He's "indestructable" (and on steroids, too, and unlike some baseball slugger, he admits it!). He has the latest in technology, nutrition, etc., but you just know the much-smaller disadvantaged hero "Rocky Balboa" (Sylvester Stallone) will somehow find a way to chop this "Goliath" down.\n\nMinute-for-minute, this might be the most entertaining of all the Rocky films, and looks good on DVD despite some graininess in the first five minutes. Rocky's wife "Adrian" (Talia Shire) never looked better: mature and pretty; the gruff and profane manager played Burgess Meredith is gone and the repellent obnoxious slob "Paulie" (Burt Young) has only a few lines. \n\nThis is the ultimate "David vs. Goliath" tale in every aspect and the final bout - held in Russia - breaks the all-time Rocky record for most punches ever thrown at two fighters. Of course, any real-life human would have been knocked cold about 50 times had they suffered the blows "Rocky" did in this fight! \n\nThis is a real flag-waving film with Rocky draping the Stars and Stripes around his shoulders. It's a totally unrealistic story but, all of these in the series were similar, credibility-wise, so just go along with it and enjoy the story. It's only an hour-and-a-half and story literally flies by.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1985-11-27","keywords":"training montage,boxing,coming out of retirement,cutting down a tree,loss of friend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky IV","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3266298649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With his gadgets expert in tow, Gibbons turns to a new Triple X agent to help him fight this threat  former comrade and now life prisoner, Darius Stone. Busting Stone out of prison, Gibbons arms him and helps him start his new mission by uncovering hidden information; as the danger increases, so does the pace and all clues lead to something very sinister indeed.\n\nThe production company credits right at the start of the film proclaim this as an "Original Films Production", a claim that I thought highly ironic since it then plunges into a pre-credit sequence that is as genre-specific as they come, a title sequence that is a clear Bond rip off and a film that delivers nothing more than the genre basics. Taking the lead from the first film, the script kills off Xander Cage with barely a mention and moves on to the new agent.

Those looking to this for a story that they can get into will be sorely disappointed as the film throws its energy into noise, explosions and typically OTT action scenes. To me and many viewers this will be just annoying hollow spectacle but to the target audience this is all they require and xXx2 does do it noisily enough to satisfy them.\n\nThe action is as stupid and illogical as the plot itself but it is noisy, stupid, big and bold and is enjoyable on that level; it is a shame that it lacks any actual tension or excitement but the noise will be enough for the target audience. At times it all gets a bit much and just looks plain silly but it never really stops moving that long so the next boom or bang is only ever minutes away, preventing you turning your brain on. The attempts at character and story are the worst  the moments with the girls really slows things down without adding even titillation value, while the potentially brave political stance made by the drawing of the president is just lost and wasted. Ice Cube picks up the mantle and delivers a one-note performance where he basically sneers his way across the screen; he lacks any sort of charisma here and could have been any old actor (something I think those hoping to make a franchise hope will be the case). Jackson is just collecting the cash so his bad performance can be ignored but Dafoe is a terrible bad guy considering he has done it well in other films. Xzibit doesn't do much but will draw humour from the MTV teenage audience thanks to his "Pimp my Ride" personae being called on. Mabrey and Gayle are basically just eye candy, with breasts squeezed and lifted in every scene  they can't act and don't have any chemistry with the basic Cube. The support cast do lots of running around with guns or diving away form bangs but nobody gets close to a performance.\n\nOverall this is a noisy genre flick, nothing more and nothing less. Those claiming how awful it is forget that there are people who don't want art films, emotional films or engaging dramas, they just want to whoop and holler as things get blowing up in fancy-looking ways.

Some of it is brilliant, while some is dire.\n\nThe acting - Haley Joel Osment as David the mecha (robot) boy is superb. He plays the role with such intelligence and maturity - it's a real achievement and bodes well for his future (if he can avoid hitting the self destruct button like so many other child stars.) Jude Law puts in another solid performance as 'Gigolo Joe' the mecha prostitute.

Overall though - good performances by all.\n\nThe sets , costumes and special effects are of a very high standard. Until the last 30 minutes or so, the use of computer graphics is tastefully done and never feel like an excuse to wow the audience with some clever CGI.

The flying and underwater scenes were also very well handled, although not mind blowing. \n\nNow the downside, and it's a big downside. \n\nThe plot is incredibly disjointed. I didn't expect it to be so obvious that this movie had been directed by two different people and thought Spielberg to be more subtle. There was apparently little attempt by Spielberg to blend his parts of the movie with Kubrick's to create a coherent whole. Instead what we get is a wonderfully dark first 60-90 minutes and then something reminiscent of 'Close Encounters of the E.T. kind' tacked on to make us feel good. As a result, the feel of the film quickly evaporated into a mush. There were a couple of chances to end the movie earlier (notably at the end of the underwater section) and it was a mistake to take the movie beyond these points. The poignancy is lost with repeated attempts to extend and explain the story in unnecessary ways, the scene with David's mother towards the end being especially contrived and saccharin. \n\nThe sum up, this felt like two movies in one - an intelligent, dark and fascinating film mixed one that's formulaic, sentimental and cheesy. Because of this it fails to reach the promised heights and at times feels messy. It's ultimately unsatisfying and left me very disappointed, but not because it's bad, but rather because I expected so much more.

The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.\n\nThen the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).\n\nAlicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.\n\nFor me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick. It's a highly entertaining satire and it's a nuanced teen comedy with a subtle social comment."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-07-19","keywords":"high school,valley girl,female protagonist,makeover,popularity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Clueless","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi993050137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxMDM5MTAtZTMzMy00NGRiLWE1ZmUtZjMwMzA1MGM4Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxMDM5MTAtZTMzMy00NGRiLWE1ZmUtZjMwMzA1MGM4Y2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000224/","name":"Alicia Silverstone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001107/","name":"Stacey Dash"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adults will suffer....greatly!","reviewBody":"Yes, I hated this movie. But what can I say in my defense? It's a family film! Its core audience is the 5- 12 crowd, and let's face facts: kids will laugh at anything! That's exactly why I've never been a big fan of family films. I'm always bound to experience the predictable quotient of gags that involve vomit, farts and kicks in the groin - all of which are in this movie. Helen Keller can see the punchlines coming a mile away. Ice Cube seems thoroughly embarrassed to be a part of this movie. I'm sure he took on the project to hopefully broaden his demographic (never having done a PG film before). The kids, like most actors their age, constantly overact. Their nonstop bickering makes you feel Ice Cube's pain of having to escort them. Cube ends up getting into every implausible disaster you can possibly imagine. It would help if the gags had even a shred of credibility. Not to mention, every time something embarrassing and disastrous happens to Cube's character, the kids laugh like hyenas, making the gags mean-spirited as well as unfunny. The only moment I remember laughing is when the kids try to drive off in Cube's minivan. He chases after them and tries to climb inside through the sunroof. The kids crash into a giant statue of a lumberjack, holding an axe. The axe then falls down and nails Cube right in his groin. Another predictable gag, but after long periods of not laughing, I had to relieve myself in some fashion.

Adults will suffer....greatly!","reviewBody":"Yes, I hated this movie. But what can I say in my defense? It's a family film! Its core audience is the 5- 12 crowd, and let's face facts: kids will laugh at anything! That's exactly why I've never been a big fan of family films. I'm always bound to experience the predictable quotient of gags that involve vomit, farts and kicks in the groin - all of which are in this movie. Helen Keller can see the punchlines coming a mile away. Ice Cube seems thoroughly embarrassed to be a part of this movie. I'm sure he took on the project to hopefully broaden his demographic (never having done a PG film before). The kids, like most actors their age, constantly overact. Their nonstop bickering makes you feel Ice Cube's pain of having to escort them. Cube ends up getting into every implausible disaster you can possibly imagine. It would help if the gags had even a shred of credibility. Not to mention, every time something embarrassing and disastrous happens to Cube's character, the kids laugh like hyenas, making the gags mean-spirited as well as unfunny. The only moment I remember laughing is when the kids try to drive off in Cube's minivan. He chases after them and tries to climb inside through the sunroof. The kids crash into a giant statue of a lumberjack, holding an axe. The axe then falls down and nails Cube right in his groin. Another predictable gag, but after long periods of not laughing, I had to relieve myself in some fashion. And like in all these movies, there's a schmaltzy conclusion that's supposed to deliver a "message." When I left the theater, I saw this one mother who was so fed up with her bratty son that she picked him up and spanked him, yelling out obscenities.

There are many in the same class of late that tried to be too intellectual, but by keeping things simpler, and never forgetting the fun element, Rise of the Guardians stand out from the pack, and dare I say one of the most enjoyable animated movies of the year.\n\nThis is the story of a new Guardian, Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), who's about to join the ranks of other luminaries such as Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), The Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and very silent Mr Sandman, all of whom thrive in today's world being the beacon of hope, and everything good, to all the little children of the world. Chosen by The Man in the Moon, the Guardians and the children form a very symbiotic relationship, that the chosen few are there to safeguard the well being of the young, while the latter fuel the powers of the Guardians through sheer belief in their existence. Lose one, and you lose the other side quite quickly.\n\nThe narrative develops at breakneck pace, with introduction to the Guardians, their abilities, and the threat from arch enemy Pitch Black (Jude Law) being the boogeyman personified, thriving on fear and nightmares, and hell bent on snuffing out hope and joy amongst the children. There's a running theme of being alone, and forgotten, that pops up every now and then, being the common thread between antagonist, and the new kid on the block, who is confused as to who he is, and what his destiny lies ahead. It's somewhat of a zero to hero story, about finding one's purpose and calling in life, and the making of sacrifices to get there. Wholesome themes somewhat, for young ones to be able to sit through and enjoy.\n\nWe would already be very familiar with the many main characters such as Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny, but what Rise of the Guardians managed to do, is to introduce a little spin of fresh air into these characters, making them unique yet retaining many of their iconic traits that make them who they are. This is something I'd really liked, and had kept me engaged, eagerly waiting for yet another surprise to pop up now and then. Santa Claus complete with tattoos, swords and a thick Russian accent? The Tooth Fairy who is part hummingbird? The Easter Bunny as Australian and with something kept up the sleeve by the story tellers for the final act, and how about The Sandman who's a lot more powerful than he looks? And they offer a lot more in terms of abilities, cause and what they bring to the table, limited only by the powers of the filmmakers' imagination.\n\nIt's preaching fun, and never to lose sight of having a little fun in life, and the movie walked the talk by filling itself with plenty of side gags, contributed by the many supporting acts each established Guardian came with, such as Santa's tiny elves, and Tooth Fairy's lovelorn fairies who swoon at the presence of Jack Frost, for his perfect pearly whites of course. You'll never look at Santa's lodge and elves in the same way ever again, nor will you at the Tooth Fairy's and Easter Bunny's operations. These unique perspectives, seen and told through the eyes of the protagonist Jack Frost, makes it a journey that we're emotionally vested into from the start, right until the end, and to me they did not disappoint a bit.\n\nWhile I hadn't watched this in 3D or IMAX versions, there are enough set action pieces that tried to exploit these formats, which I suppose either format would have enveloped the viewer and provided a more vivid experience, especially with characters being made to pursue and battle each other in the air, or the numerous extravaganza moments where the prowess of the characters will wow. The quality of animation is superb and is the score contributed by Alexandre Desplat, and again, the simple tale, its treatment and development, are refreshing in not biting off more than it can chew.\n\nDirector Peter Ramsey has now launched his career with a very solid delivery of a film for children, and balanced this appeal for the adults as well. I'm already all for a sequel should one be created, but as a standalone, this one is definitely for keeps.

Busting Stone out of prison, Gibbons arms him and helps him start his new mission by uncovering hidden information; as the danger increases, so does the pace and all clues lead to something very sinister indeed.\n\nThe production company credits right at the start of the film proclaim this as an "Original Films Production", a claim that I thought highly ironic since it then plunges into a pre-credit sequence that is as genre-specific as they come, a title sequence that is a clear Bond rip off and a film that delivers nothing more than the genre basics. Taking the lead from the first film, the script kills off Xander Cage with barely a mention and moves on to the new agent.

At times it all gets a bit much and just looks plain silly but it never really stops moving that long so the next boom or bang is only ever minutes away, preventing you turning your brain on. The attempts at character and story are the worst  the moments with the girls really slows things down without adding even titillation value, while the potentially brave political stance made by the drawing of the president is just lost and wasted. Ice Cube picks up the mantle and delivers a one-note performance where he basically sneers his way across the screen; he lacks any sort of charisma here and could have been any old actor (something I think those hoping to make a franchise hope will be the case). Jackson is just collecting the cash so his bad performance can be ignored but Dafoe is a terrible bad guy considering he has done it well in other films. Xzibit doesn't do much but will draw humour from the MTV teenage audience thanks to his "Pimp my Ride" personae being called on. Mabrey and Gayle are basically just eye candy, with breasts squeezed and lifted in every scene  they can't act and don't have any chemistry with the basic Cube. The support cast do lots of running around with guns or diving away form bangs but nobody gets close to a performance.\n\nOverall this is a noisy genre flick, nothing more and nothing less. Those claiming how awful it is forget that there are people who don't want art films, emotional films or engaging dramas, they just want to whoop and holler as things get blowing up in fancy-looking ways.

The film is extremely derivative, interesting premise with far too over-familiar execution that has nothing new. The lack of imagination and suspense also hurts the film, too much evokes cringing and the thrills are sporadic.
