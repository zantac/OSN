This observation was confirmed although the second film is still very funny. I have to admit that it is full of commonplaces and cliches to an annoying degree. The truth is that you laugh and that is the aim of a comedy. There is no originality in the jokes, they are as commonplace and trite as you could imagine but I found myself laughing most of the time.\n\nThe plot is simple. The bourgeois elderly couple strives to keep their four daughters in France while the latter under the instigation of their foreign husbands seek to pursue their luck outside their country to destinations linked with the origins of their spouses. The lengths to which the paterfamilias and his wife go to incite their daughters and grooms to remain in France inspire the main comedy effect of the film.\n\nIt is important to note that the scenario is very apt concerning current affairs in French society so that anyone closely following developments in French social reality will recognize imediately that important and "heavy" matters dividing national opinion such as immigration, integration and tolerance towards Muslim practices or legalization of homosexual marriage are treated in a lighter vein and produce ample laughter despite their insoluble and often tragic aspects in real life.\n\nI recommend this movie which without being a masterpiece will appeal to those with a vivid interest in the dilemmas of postmodern multicultural society who are ready to put aside for a moment the often tragic connotations of those matters and accept the comic element which is inherent even in the most serious aspects of human social coexistence.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6901,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-30","keywords":"sequel,singing in a car,dysfunctional family,reference to donald trump,arab man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi385595929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThjODc0ODItN2MyNC00MWVkLWEzZmQtZTQ0MDlhZWVjZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThjODc0ODItN2MyNC00MWVkLWEzZmQtZTQ0MDlhZWVjZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002010/","name":"Christian Clavier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0490702/","name":"Chantal Lauby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2987278/","name":"Ary Abittan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154385/","name":"Philippe de Chauveron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0367060/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0718581/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491230/","name":"Guy Laurent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154385/","name":"Philippe de Chauveron"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This observation was confirmed although the second film is still very funny. I have to admit that it is full of commonplaces and cliches to an annoying degree. The truth is that you laugh and that is the aim of a comedy. There is no originality in the jokes, they are as commonplace and trite as you could imagine but I found myself laughing most of the time.\n\nThe plot is simple. The bourgeois elderly couple strives to keep their four daughters in France while the latter under the instigation of their foreign husbands seek to pursue their luck outside their country to destinations linked with the origins of their spouses. The lengths to which the paterfamilias and his wife go to incite their daughters and grooms to remain in France inspire the main comedy effect of the film.\n\nIt is important to note that the scenario is very apt concerning current affairs in French society so that anyone closely following developments in French social reality will recognize imediately that important and "heavy" matters dividing national opinion such as immigration, integration and tolerance towards Muslim practices or legalization of homosexual marriage are treated in a lighter vein and produce ample laughter despite their insoluble and often tragic aspects in real life.\n\nI recommend this movie which without being a masterpiece will appeal to those with a vivid interest in the dilemmas of postmodern multicultural society who are ready to put aside for a moment the often tragic connotations of those matters and accept the comic element which is inherent even in the most serious aspects of human social coexistence.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6901,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-30","keywords":"sequel,singing in a car,dysfunctional family,reference to donald trump,arab man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi385595929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThjODc0ODItN2MyNC00MWVkLWEzZmQtZTQ0MDlhZWVjZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThjODc0ODItN2MyNC00MWVkLWEzZmQtZTQ0MDlhZWVjZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002010/","name":"Christian Clavier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0490702/","name":"Chantal Lauby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2987278/","name":"Ary Abittan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154385/","name":"Philippe de Chauveron"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0367060/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0718581/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491230/","name":"Guy Laurent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154385/","name":"Philippe de Chauveron"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Impossible not to love her after the remarkable performance of Liliana Juárez, winner of the award for best actress for this role at the last Mar del Plata Film Festival.\n\nThe harshness of some situations are resolved with the best resource: humor, in an arduous film in several senses.\n\nIn short, a film that presents us with the centrality of work (in situations that are not exclusive to public employment) and its impact on ties and to what extent individual resistance to power and adverse changes is a possible path or a trap.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-15","keywords":"work","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2604449817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFhMjY5MTYtNDUwMC00Y2U1LWEzYmMtZjA4ZTc0MDIyNWQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFhMjY5MTYtNDUwMC00Y2U1LWEzYmMtZjA4ZTc0MDIyNWQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4989891/","name":"Liliana Juárez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0088164/","name":"Rosario Bléfari","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1213740/","name":"Verónica Perrotta"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4991308/","name":"Ezequiel Radusky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250991/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202630/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1195308/","name":"Diego Lerman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4991308/","name":"Ezequiel Radusky"],"duration":"PT1H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But unfortunately, there will be a lot of fools out there: This won't be the hit that Tykwer's former film was. And, just to say that: Run Lola Run still plays in a higher league.\n\nBut that's, of course, not to say that The Princess And The Warrior is a bad movie. Quite the contrary: there should be more films like this one. It's slow at times, yes, but to the ones with keen eyes it's meditative. It's metaphysical, in the end even surreal, it's down-to-earth, but at the same time very outlandish, it's a love story, but without the usual assets: there's no kissing, let alone sex; yes, even holding hands just occurs for a second. It's about a spiritual love, something epic, as the title suggests.\n\nMany people won't like it; far too few people will love it.

His movies are so damn entertaining. They always, well I should say most of the time, have wit and intelligence [Forget 'Showgirls' and 'Hollow Man', any director can make mistakes] and have either graphic sex or violence or both. 'Basic Instinct' is in the latter category. It is so erotic and Stone and Douglas have so much sexual chemistry that when you look at an Adrian Lyne film, you see them for the crap they are.\n\nBasic plotline has Stone's character, 'Catherine Tramell', accused of the vicious sex murder of a retired rock and roll star. Douglas's character has a strange attraction to her, which may not lead to good things..... Paul Verhoven has openly admitted that this film is a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's  classic masterpiece 'Vertigo'. In fact, Stone wears, in sequence, the same wardrobe as Kim Novak did [which makes you wonder, was she wearing panties under her clothes]. That brings us to the interrogation scene, which is the best in the movie. Stone shamelessly flirts with the cops' libidos until the buildup of sexual tension is so great, Stone releases it by playing 'peek-a-boo'  with the space in between her legs. Every male viewer cherishes that scene, simply because it is so sexy. That word can be used throughout the film, as Stone and Douglas do the mattress mumbo. At the time, the sex scenes were so realistic that the press went wild and debated whether or not viewers were witnessing un-simulated sex. The film is still quite sexually daring today and  has an intriguing spider's web plot too. The plot's twists and turns manage to make the movie sexier as the viewer wonders whether Sharon is innocent or guilty..........\n\nThe film's only misstep occurs at the end, with an unsatisfactory ending that makes the whole film seem like some stupid, contrived game. But it's not. It keeps it's fascination and it's sexiness and its suspense right up till the end, which is what a good erotic thriller should. Actually, the ending for some will lead to a lot of discussion if you watch the film with someone, as the film toys with two of the film's characters innocence or guilt and does not give up all its secrets.....\n\nThe film is great Verhoeven. It has his usual, hilarious, seemingly inappropriate kinky humor and extreme sex and violence to match. The fact that Verhoeven is actually able to balance the film and make it funny and sexy is wonderful film-making. Well, have I said 'sexy' enough times? Then go rent it.........8/10\n\nP.S. If you like this one, check out Verhoevens' Dutch film ''The Fourth Man''. It has a similar plot and even a similar character that resembles Catherine Tramell. If the ending of 'Basic Instinct' leaves you wanting, check that film out. It is even better than 'Basic' and is more 'arty'. It is also a little bit more daring erotically.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-03-20","keywords":"erotic thriller,manipulation,female psychopath,narcissistic personality disorder,mind game","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Basic Instinct","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi129564953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEzYmZhZTAtMWVkYi00NWQ2LWIzNWQtNTYwOTI1ZmQ1ZjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEzYmZhZTAtMWVkYi00NWQ2LWIzNWQtNTYwOTI1ZmQ1ZjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001169/","name":"George Dzundza"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000682/","name":"Paul Verhoeven"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094459/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000390/","name":"Joe Eszterhas"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A small film crew is doing a ride- along with the fire department to get a first hand look at what their daily professional lives are really like. The film is presented the film crew's unedited stock footage, so we get lots of video of the firemen acting not at all like firemen but instead like young men who are living in close quarters for long periods of time. Finally an interesting call comes in and the crew are called out to a building in town. \n\nUp to this point, the movie is presented in a style even more realistic than a documentary, because the footage that we see is not even edited. Once they arrive at the building, of course, weird things start happening.\n\nYou know the premise, the movie is essentially a zombie movie, but a lot of the suspense and tension is predicated on the fact that this group of innocent people have been for some reason barricaded inside a building by the police, government, military, whatever. Soon we find out that it's the Center For Disease Control doing the quarantining, but the point is, the people that are meant to protect us are locking these innocent people inside a building and leaving them for dead and the people inside have no idea why.\n\nBut here's my first question, how do you lock an entire modern fire crew inside an old, dilapidated building presumably made primarily of plaster and wood? Later they discover that approaching windows is enough to get yourself shot, but after what happened soon after they arrived at the building, I am willing to bet that none of those guys would have been willing to spend more than two or three minutes locked unwillingly inside the building.\n\nNext, it seems that breaking through plaster walls is not the only bit of standard fireman training that these guys are lacking. When people start getting hurt, at one point one of the firemen calls out, "Is there a doctor in the house?" I had been under the impression that in order to be a fireman you have to have some emergency medical treatment training, but I could be wrong. I had to do the training in order to be a summer camp counselor a couple years ago, but maybe sleep-away camps are just stricter than your typical major city fire department.\n\nJennifer Carpenter is the lead character, the host of the documentary that the film crew was making. You may remember her from The Exorcism of Emily Rose, the astonishingly scary horror film that she starred in back in 2004. Sadly, Quarantine just doesn't have the story or the content to give her much to do except run around looking scared. Her performance as Emily Rose was one of the best horror performances I've ever seen, but Quarantine just gives the feeling that she's waiting for an opportunity or a good reason to do some real horror acting.\n\nOverall the movie is not bad, but it is overwhelmingly casual in its presentation of a typical horror movie, this time with the slight variation that all of the victims are trapped in close quarters with the zombies. They have zombies trying to get them inside the building, and humans on the outside pointing guns at the building to prevent any escape and outbreak of the virus causing the zombiness.\n\nThere is an interesting scene where the cameraguy actually uses the camera to bludgeon one of the zombies to death, which provides a unique point of view. I had never seen a zombie killed in a movie like that before, but other than that there is just not much special about the movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-07","keywords":"found footage,apartment building,trapped,virus,quarantine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quarantine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3133276441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAzMDM1Njg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk0OTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAzMDM1Njg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk0OTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Quarantine - Theatrical Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1358539/","name":"Jennifer Carpenter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004996/","name":"Steve Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1551922/","name":"Columbus Short"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235719/","name":"John Erick Dowdle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245483/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235719/","name":"John Erick Dowdle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1803105/","name":"Drew Dowdle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0049371/","name":"Jaume Balagueró"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I found his delivery perfect for the role.\n\nScript: The script was fairly intelligent but fell into a few standard-caper-script holes in a few spots. Overall the script maintained its character through the interpersonal banter, particularly with Reynolds.\n\nSoundtrack: Excellent. Perhaps the greatest complement to an intelligent movie is a groovy soundtrack that helps keep the momentum of the film going. This soundtrack is groovy. Think Ocean's Eleven with George Clooney.\n\nPlausibility: Well, here we have problems. Don't think this is realistic, just be thankful you don't have Arnie flying a Harrier jet. Hey, it's as plausible as Ocean's Eleven.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this movie, and I would happily recommend it to almost anyone.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10132,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-05-11","keywords":"heist,warehouse,apartment,gangster,planning","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Foolproof","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4138139929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI3ZWNkOTAtOWM1ZC00YzNiLWE3NGItMjg1NGNiMTc3ZTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI3ZWNkOTAtOWM1ZC00YzNiLWE3NGItMjg1NGNiMTc3ZTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Lionsgate Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0095746/","name":"Kristin Booth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0419005/","name":"Joris Jarsky"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680889/","name":"William Phillips"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093742/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680889/","name":"William Phillips"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I found his delivery perfect for the role.\n\nScript: The script was fairly intelligent but fell into a few standard-caper-script holes in a few spots. Overall the script maintained its character through the interpersonal banter, particularly with Reynolds.\n\nSoundtrack: Excellent. Perhaps the greatest complement to an intelligent movie is a groovy soundtrack that helps keep the momentum of the film going. This soundtrack is groovy. Think Ocean's Eleven with George Clooney.\n\nPlausibility: Well, here we have problems. Don't think this is realistic, just be thankful you don't have Arnie flying a Harrier jet. Hey, it's as plausible as Ocean's Eleven.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this movie, and I would happily recommend it to almost anyone.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10132,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-05-11","keywords":"heist,warehouse,apartment,gangster,planning","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Foolproof","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4138139929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI3ZWNkOTAtOWM1ZC00YzNiLWE3NGItMjg1NGNiMTc3ZTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI3ZWNkOTAtOWM1ZC00YzNiLWE3NGItMjg1NGNiMTc3ZTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Lionsgate Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0095746/","name":"Kristin Booth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0419005/","name":"Joris Jarsky"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680889/","name":"William Phillips"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093742/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680889/","name":"William Phillips"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But know know what? This was actually a good remake.\n\nWhile the movie is very similar to the original, they did make some small changes here and there, mainly in the characters background and their motivation - which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original (for example, why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek). Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.\n\nIt's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original, but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job. James Woods was excellent as a southern redneck and Kate Bosworth was surprisingly good too. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors, who were all decent in their roles.\n\nThe ending had some small changes too - again, made in order for the characters to have a better motivation. Still, I prefer the ending of the original, which I recall was more intense and more "surreal", made to show a man protecting his "castle".\n\nAll in all, this remake is much better than many of the recent remakes I've seen (or chose to skip). Was this remake necessary?

But know know what? This was actually a good remake.\n\nWhile the movie is very similar to the original, they did make some small changes here and there, mainly in the characters background and their motivation - which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original (for example, why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek). Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.\n\nIt's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original, but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job. James Woods was excellent as a southern redneck and Kate Bosworth was surprisingly good too. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors, who were all decent in their roles.\n\nThe ending had some small changes too - again, made in order for the characters to have a better motivation. Still, I prefer the ending of the original, which I recall was more intense and more "surreal", made to show a man protecting his "castle".\n\nAll in all, this remake is much better than many of the recent remakes I've seen (or chose to skip). Was this remake necessary? Probably not.\n\n5/10 Worth watching","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33631,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"rape,sexual humiliation,rape victim,gang rape,panties pulled down","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi174103833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNzU4MDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNzU4MDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"L.A. screenwriter David Sumner relocates with his wife to her hometown in the deep South.

Both adults are left wanting to know the truth and filled with half-ideas and images that haunt them  when Gillian Guiler son is taken, this becomes even more important to them.  Meanwhile the military, led by investigator Claude Lacombe uncover planes and ships that have been missing for decades and uncover hidden codes and signals in the mysterious crafts.\n\nI am currently ploughing my way through Speilberg's Taken on BBC2 so I thought I'd give this classic another view just to remind myself how good Speilberg and aliens can be.  The plot is perfect for any UFO nut  the government are behind everything and know of everything.  The story unfolds really well  the three main stories complimenting each other and giving the film a sense of pace.  The strand with Lacombe following events all round the globe is the least personal (and thus least involving) but it is enticing us for the climax of the film.  Neary's soul searching maybe does go on a little too long but the emotion in the family situation is intense and his frustration and sense of confusion is very real.  Although the thrid strand has less screen time the abduction of the child is a powerful scene and the emotion is well brought out.\n\nThe special effects are very good but the glue of the film is the emotional telling.  This is Speilberg doing well  he never really gives into his American Apple Pie style sentimentality and the film keeps moving along and has a real emotional heart to it.  The climax of the movie always sort of messes me up and I find it best not to question it's logic on any level for fear of holes opening up all over it  but it does have a sense of childlike wonder to it, which I guess Speilberg was trying to get across.\n\nAs usual Dreyfuss does well under Speilberg and he is mostly responsible for keeping the emotion in his character realistic without being all syrupy and sickly.  Truffaut is OK but it's impossible to see him as anyone but Francis Truffaut and his character suffers as a result.  Garr and Dillon are both strong female characters for different reasons and the support cast are generally very good (including a good handful of the Dreyfuss family).\n\nOverall this film never gets me as one of the greatest sci-fi's of all time, but it is certainly a very good film that takes `real' people as it's driver and not flashy effect shots.  That `Taken' seems to be slipping into Norman Rockwell type mawkishness is good enough reason to revisit CE3K."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":192068,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1978-12-25","keywords":"alien,mothership,close encounter of the third kind,single mother,vision","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Close Encounters of the Third Kind","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1849145625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNjA4MDY5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0NTkyMzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNjA4MDY5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0NTkyMzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Re-Release Trailer for Close Encounters of the Third Kind"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000377/","name":"Richard Dreyfuss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000076/","name":"François Truffaut"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000414/","name":"Teri Garr"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0328941/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103338/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059493/","name":"Hal Barwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069547/","name":"Jerry Belson"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Mummy Returns portrays the Scorpion King as some evil tyrant who wants to take over the world by smiting any and all civilizations in his way. But that's exactly the opposite of the same character in his very own movie. In fact he struggles to overthrow an evil ruler for those very reasons.\n\nSo when, and why, did he become bad? I'm afraid I'm not following this. The movie, however, is entertaining, if rather short and silly. Chuck Russell tries to cram in loads of fighting and hokum as he can. It works and The Rock is very cool as said King (or Mathayus) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily-clad Cassandra. Grant Heslov and Michael Clarke Duncan fill out their usual roles as ethnic comic-relief and big, muscley guy.\n\nThe film has slightly less integrity to it than the Mummy movies. This is evident with the fun and lively, but completely inappropriate, score by John Debney. I'm not expecting anything like his Passion of the Christ score but blaring death metal guitars seem kinda out of place in a movie set 3000 years BC.\n\nBut this movie is a cheeseburger, not a 17-course dinner.

The Mummy Returns portrays the Scorpion King as some evil tyrant who wants to take over the world by smiting any and all civilizations in his way. But that's exactly the opposite of the same character in his very own movie. In fact he struggles to overthrow an evil ruler for those very reasons.\n\nSo when, and why, did he become bad? I'm afraid I'm not following this. The movie, however, is entertaining, if rather short and silly. Chuck Russell tries to cram in loads of fighting and hokum as he can. It works and The Rock is very cool as said King (or Mathayus) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily-clad Cassandra. Grant Heslov and Michael Clarke Duncan fill out their usual roles as ethnic comic-relief and big, muscley guy.\n\nThe film has slightly less integrity to it than the Mummy movies. This is evident with the fun and lively, but completely inappropriate, score by John Debney. I'm not expecting anything like his Passion of the Christ score but blaring death metal guitars seem kinda out of place in a movie set 3000 years BC.\n\nBut this movie is a cheeseburger, not a 17-course dinner. So why bother complaining. After all it's a prequel of a sequel of a movie that was a re-make of a movie that was made in the 30's. But it's well made and loads of fun so just go along with it and you'll enjoy.\n\nFilmed in Panavision the DVD is in perfect 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with very loud and thrilling Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound.

However, I find it difficult to compare the films, largely because Will Graham (Norton) is completely different to Clarice Starling (Foster). The different dimension they bring to the investigation is enough, by itself, to distinguish them beyond comparison.\n\n2) This was the third film in the series. The problem with the Hollywood pumping out an absurd number of sequels and prequels (even when the original film was terrible to begin with) is that it alters the public's attitude towards them. People are usually happy to see the "part 2" but beyond that, you're usually down to loyalists. In fact, this situation has been made worse due to the fact that many of the sequels made are shockingly bad (eg, the American Pie sequels, the Highlander sequels). Some are so terrible that they can actually tarnish the memory of the original (eg... Matrix Revolutions). So a third Hannibal film was always going to be an uphill battle. \n\n3) This followed an awful sequel: Hannibal. People who thought Hannibal was terrible (and there's no shortage of them) are likely to turn their nose up at any further sequels or prequels. That's what Hollywood always overlooks - once you pump out one bad sequel (eg, Ocean's Twelve 2004), fewer people will even consider seeing the next sequel, unless it receives almost unanimous critical acclaim.\n\nI did not like Hannibal either and I think that many stars in Hollywood would have turned it down after reading the script. Jodie Foster, with the offer of reprising her academy awarding winning role, and Jon Demme (director of Silence of the lambs) walked away from the Hannibal after disagreements with author (Harris) over the character directions. Hopkins nearly left when Foster and Demme walked, but was persuaded to stay (probably with a nice salary increase!). In any case, key elements were gone and in my view, they ultimately failed to attract a strong supporting cast. \n\nBy contrast, I think many actors would have been falling over themselves to land one of the roles in Red Dragon after reading the script. Accordingly, we ended up with Hopkins (reprising his academy award winning role to absolute perfection), Norton (who is the rightful winner of the academy award for American History X in my view, even though the academy went to someone else that year), Harvey Keitel, Ralph Finnes and the brilliant, but under-rated, Phillip Seymore Hoffman. They combine to breath tremendous life into this investigative/thriller. And the opening 5 minutes is magnificent.\n\nHowever, I have two criticisms that cost it a star. First, it wasn't quite dark enough. Perhaps that masterpiece, the Silence of the Lambs, used up all the visceral attributes that were so pathetically contrived in Hannibal and present, but not powerfully present, in Red Dragon. There certainly was a dark edge, but it just didn't get under my skin the way Silence of the Lambs did (if you'll forgive the pun). \n\nSecond, I felt that there were a few off-shoots to the main plot that could have been worked around or seemed to play no real role in the film whatsoever. For example, the tense relationship between Norton and the reporter (Hoffman), Finnes taking the blind girl to listen to the sedated tiger (or lion or whatever it was), Norton teaching his wife to shoot ... and many others. Most of the time, I felt that they should have been left on the cutting room floor as they were of little interest, had little (if any) role in the context of the story and accordingly, unnecessarily bulked out the running time of the film.\n\nOtherwise, terrific viewing. Don't be dissuaded by Hannibal - this sequel achieves where that one so dismally failed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262153,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-12-11","keywords":"fbi agent,criminal profile,blindness,tabloid reporter,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Red Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi848298265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1ZWZmODktZGJjOS00ZGMyLWI3MzYtYmExZTRmMTJkM2UyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1ZWZmODktZGJjOS00ZGMyLWI3MzYtYmExZTRmMTJkM2UyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711840/","name":"Brett Ratner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848217/","name":"Ted Tally"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome.

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun!

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Just sit and watch this movie on a nice evening, and you won't repent it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-07-07","keywords":"based on legend,love triangle,arthurian legend,king arthur character,warlord","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000566/","name":"Julia Ormond"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958387/","name":"Jerry Zucker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057539/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0131661/","name":"Lorne Cameron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395924/","name":"David Hoselton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629933/","name":"William Nicholson"],"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun! This is entertainment, after all. My rating: 7 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-23","keywords":"character name as series title,surname as series title,one word series title,2010s,reboot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1395771/","name":"Lucas Till","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1159702/","name":"Tristin Mays","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2058713/","name":"Justin Hires"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0504531/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0957453/","name":"Lee David Zlotoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006997/","name":"Peter M.

That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In my experience, in other countries the main characters are more developed, made to be experienced as more human and end up more likable than American crime drama series main characters. Ultraviolet is the first Polish tv series I have watched and, not only does it not disappoint, it has a refreshing POV on crime solving by using the amateur Internet sleuths. I LOVED IT!!!  I sure hope Netflix offers us the 2nd season, and more!!!!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1479,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime"],"datePublished":"2017-10-25","keywords":"technology","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9426329/","name":"Viet Anh Do","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2203849/","name":"Marta Nieradkiewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867603/","name":"Bartlomiej Topa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0668353/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0506795/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922388/","name":"Wendy West"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In "Salt", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie, she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs, although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. They put them on in front of her leaving her with a slight chance to get away. I guess the point of this movie: don't try this at home.\n\nThe essential plot I think is quite compelling, and I don't want to give too much away but only to say that nothing is at it seems until the very end. But I think I would have liked more of the mystery behind the story than all the long action sequences which I felt undermined a potentially complex idea. These days in filmmaking, it seems that the longer action sequences displace story development. There are flashbacks to a greater story but a lot of it was more confusing than insightful.\n\nAfter a brief prelude in which Jolie is interrogated and tortured by North Korean military agents, the movie begins, presumably about a year later, with a Russian requesting asylum with the United States via the CIA. Agent Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogates the defector who tells a strange story about how the Russians infiltrate the United States with moles programmed and brainwashed during childhood. Only seconds after the interview is over, the defector is killing CIA agents and escaping the headquarters. And so is Salt. In fact, the agency is more determined to get Salt than the defector, which is one of the many little glaring plot problems that occur during this movie. The non-stop action begins here, fueled by several plots and subplots.\n\nI think Salt is a decent film but not a great one. At least what it does successfully is keep you guessing. You're not sure what Salt is doing, where she's going, or even whose side she's on which keeps you at the edge of your seat. By movies end, I still had a lot of unanswered questions that were not explained through the action sequences. I also realized at one point, Jolie doesn't say much after the initial interview until the very end. It's hard not to like Jolie but I think she should have requested a bit of a better script with a little bit less chasing, gunning and blowing things up.

In "Salt", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie, she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs, although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. They put them on in front of her leaving her with a slight chance to get away. I guess the point of this movie: don't try this at home.\n\nThe essential plot I think is quite compelling, and I don't want to give too much away but only to say that nothing is at it seems until the very end. But I think I would have liked more of the mystery behind the story than all the long action sequences which I felt undermined a potentially complex idea. These days in filmmaking, it seems that the longer action sequences displace story development. There are flashbacks to a greater story but a lot of it was more confusing than insightful.\n\nAfter a brief prelude in which Jolie is interrogated and tortured by North Korean military agents, the movie begins, presumably about a year later, with a Russian requesting asylum with the United States via the CIA. Agent Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogates the defector who tells a strange story about how the Russians infiltrate the United States with moles programmed and brainwashed during childhood. Only seconds after the interview is over, the defector is killing CIA agents and escaping the headquarters. And so is Salt. In fact, the agency is more determined to get Salt than the defector, which is one of the many little glaring plot problems that occur during this movie. The non-stop action begins here, fueled by several plots and subplots.\n\nI think Salt is a decent film but not a great one. At least what it does successfully is keep you guessing. You're not sure what Salt is doing, where she's going, or even whose side she's on which keeps you at the edge of your seat. By movies end, I still had a lot of unanswered questions that were not explained through the action sequences. I also realized at one point, Jolie doesn't say much after the initial interview until the very end. It's hard not to like Jolie but I think she should have requested a bit of a better script with a little bit less chasing, gunning and blowing things up. Jolie can also act, not just chase.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":304175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-07-21","keywords":"spy,one woman army,strong female lead,russian spy,spy thriller","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Salt: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1236141849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NWQwODgtNjA1YS00ZTEzLWE4NzYtZTUxODYzYmE1ODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NWQwODgtNjA1YS00ZTEzLWE4NzYtZTUxODYzYmE1ODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"Evelyn Salt (Jolie) is a CIA officer who swore an oath to duty, honor, and country.

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).\n\nEveryone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.\n\nLike Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.\n\nWhen it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better "Snatch".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":810515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-09-01","keywords":"diamond,boxer,narrated by character,fight,cockney accent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Snatch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1558577433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334318/","name":"Stephen Graham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Excellent character driven narrative around families, relationships, parenting, financial and racial divides, corruption, climate change, climate refugees, PTSD and traumas from just being alive as its all going down. One might think the writers had a crystal ball - it's pretty spot on and so well timed given that our entire continent is burning and that climate change is no longer some abstract futuristic theory, but something we are now living through, even in our cities. An enjoyable watch, some might find boring, possibly all the people that have reviewed this show thinking it's Lisa Macwhatsherface in the lead role (spoiler: it's not, and yes that British accent is real) - but this show really delivers in the last few episodes in season one. It's in your face about many subjects we like to shun - if you are after a non thought provoking, non challenging easy view, go watch something else, this is not for you. Touching a lot on the effects the changing climate has on young people and their narratives and responses around that, I found this helpful as a parent.

An enjoyable watch, some might find boring, possibly all the people that have reviewed this show thinking it's Lisa Macwhatsherface in the lead role (spoiler: it's not, and yes that British accent is real) - but this show really delivers in the last few episodes in season one. It's in your face about many subjects we like to shun - if you are after a non thought provoking, non challenging easy view, go watch something else, this is not for you. Touching a lot on the effects the changing climate has on young people and their narratives and responses around that, I found this helpful as a parent. Great all round production, futuristic but realistic visual, A1 cast portraying depth-full honest and challenging characters. If you liked Aussie drama Love my way, you will like this. A lot.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"wanting to have a baby,climate change,female protagonist,melodrama,near future","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296219/","name":"Joanne Froggatt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672303/","name":"Rupert Penry-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2256017/","name":"David Lyons"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0292799/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [EN]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3580346649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIwMTM1NzgtM2Q0Ni00NmJhLTljZmQtOGE0ZmM3OThlYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIwMTM1NzgtM2Q0Ni00NmJhLTljZmQtOGE0ZmM3OThlYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed.

The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

It's been 80 years since THE WIZARD OF OZ was released and 50 years since Judy Garland died. So why do we still care so much? Of course the obvious reason is that, for many generations, her adventures as Dorothy Gale from Kansas marked the first time many of us kids could put ourselves in the shoes (mine weren't ruby sparkles) of a lead character in a movie. Her fantastical journey ignited our imaginations and whisked us away to fight witches and flying monkeys, while making wonderful friends in a corn patch and enchanted forest. Oh, and that voice! However, there is another side to this coin. Judy's story is also an example of the dark and tarnished side of Hollywood ... she pulled back more than one curtain.\n\nRenee Zellweger (Oscar winner for COLD MOUNTAIN, 2003) stars as Judy Garland, and her performance will likely put her in line for her fourth Oscar nomination. The film basically covers the last year of Judy's life, and director Rupert Goold (TRUE STORY, 2015) is working from a script by Tom Edge adapted from Peter Quilter's stage play, "End of the Rainbow". There is no Lollipop Guild here. Instead, the harsh realities of Judy's life are explored. The film opens with Judy and her kids, Joe and Lorna, performing on stage ... and then being unceremoniously denied a room at a nearby luxury hotel. See, Judy's career is in a bad way (admittedly undependable and uninsurable) - as is her health. She is broke, has no home, and offers for roles or performances have dried up. She ends up at her ex-husband Sid Luft's (Rufus Sewell) home, which after some former-spouse bickering, is where the kids stay.\n\nWith no other real prospective gigs, Judy accepts an offer from Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon) to perform at his Talk of the Town theatre in London. Most of the film covers her time in London, and the challenges for all involved. She's 46 years old in the winter of 1968, and though her voice no longer carries the sublime purity of those early years, Judy still has incredible stage presence and an ability to connect with the audience. The challenges occur for her assigned assistant Rosalyn Wilder (who served as a consultant on the film, and is played here by rising star Jessie Buckley), as well as Judy herself. She misses her kids, and is battling loneliness and an addiction to pills - causing her to rarely eat or sleep. When her "friend" (and fifth husband) Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) shows up, Judy's attitude perks up, but her already questionable dependability falters.\n\nFlashbacks to Judy's teenage years at MGM are used to portray how the studio and industry took control of her body, soul and career. Watching studio head Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) bully young Judy (played by newcomer Darci Shaw) by pretending to be a father figure while keeping her weight in line with a diet of cigarettes, diet pills, and soup, is just painful. These scenes, including those with young Judy's frequent co-star Mickey Rooney, help us understand why she was in such a state by the time she hit London. Ms. Zellweger embodies the blend of frailty and determination and talent, as well as the insecurities that simultaneously drove Judy and held her back. Of course, few singers have ever possessed the vocal talent of Judy, but Zellweger admirably brings the appropriate strain and pain to the songs she sings for the movie, including "By Myself" and "The Trolley Song".\n\nBorn Frances Ethel Gumm, Judy Garland first hit the stage at age 2, and never experienced a "normal" childhood or traditional relationship. Despite her immense talent, she was never able to find peace with the pressures of performing. Years of abuse led to an early death, not long after she finished her London run. The film never backs away from the tragic story, but also allows one of the brightest stars of an era to shine through. For those who only know Judy as that homesick girl from Kansas, or maybe also as the rosy-cheeked youngster on the Trolley in the holiday favorite MEET ME IN ST LOUIS (directed by her future husband Vincente Minnelli), there is likely a shock factor in seeing the broken icon in middle age. The film also deals with that always-present bond she had with her audience, especially with the gay community - although a certain sequence of the film seems quite improbable.\n\nFor a film like this to work (it was not sanctioned by Judy's daughter Liza Minnelli), it all rides on the lead performance. Renee Zellweger beautifully captures both the tragic essence and the stunning talent of the late 1960's Judy Garland, an iconic and revered entertainment figure. The film allows us to understand the lifelong mistreatment and heartbreak of this woman, as well as the strength and joy she received while performing live. Balancing the "early" Judy with the "later" Judy was a brilliant way of bringing her life full circle. Ms. Zellweger's performance goes so much deeper than singing on stage ... she embodies the insecurity and frailties of a woman who was never afforded the opportunity to live her own life.\n\nNOTE: There was a 2001 TV mini-series entitled "Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows", based on daughter Lorna Luft's memoir, in which Judy Davis (lip-synching to Ms. Garland's songs) delivered an impressive and Emmy winning performance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"london england,concert,year 1968,ex husband ex wife relationship,sleeplessness","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing !?!?!

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For women, having children is the ultimate achievement and fulfillment of their lives.

Lessons learned: men who don't want to marry and have children are portrayed as immature, self-absorbed, selfish, and misguided. Carting lots of screaming kids around in a minivan is, apparently, the most fun a man can have in this lifetime.  For women, having children is the ultimate achievement and fulfillment of their lives.  This is an insulting fairy tale that women will love, because it shows men who don't want marriage and kids as BAD and men who do want marriage and kids as GOOD.  Women are always GOOD no matter what their attitude or actions are.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-07-12","keywords":"time for title,bad dream,close up of eyes,close up of lips,close up of mouth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nine Months","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2812084505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0105317/","name":"Patrick Braoudé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the end all of his films demand that the viewer connects to his concept of the flow of life and death and those aspects of living that make a difference. Les petits mouchoirs AKA Little White Lies magnifies these attributes. The story is so conversationally written that for a while it is difficult to pull together where the film is going, but by the end of the film the audience is so choked by the discoveries revealed that tears and a stunned afterburn are inevitable.\n\nEvery year, Max Cantara (François Cluzet), a successful restaurant owner, and Véronique (Valérie Bonneton), his eco-friendly wife invite a their close-knit circle of friends to their beautiful Cap Ferrat beach house near Bordeaux to celebrate the birthday of Antoine (Laurent Lafitte) and kick-start the vacation. But, this year, before they all leave Paris, their mutual friend Ludo (Jean Dujardin) is hurt in a serious motorcycle accident, ends up the ICU and as the doctors say nothing can be done to change things for at least two weeks, the friends all proceed with their plans for vacation: no one stays behind to be supportive of Ludo, not even his apparent love partner Marie (Marion Cotillard). This sets off a dramatic chain of reactions and emotional responses. The eagerly anticipated vacation leads each of the protagonists to raise the little veils that for years they have draped over what bothers and upsets them. Pretenses become increasingly hard to keep up. Until the moment when the truth finally catches up with them all: each member of the group of friends has a problem that needs the support of real friends but none of them has the ability to share personal secrets. There are many concepts that are present here - one married man Vincent (Benoît Magimel) has an inexplicable physical and emotional attraction to Max who loathes the idea of a possible gay liaison; Marie is visited by an infrequent lover Nassim (Hocine Mérabet), Eric (Gilles Lellouche) longs to be reunited with the woman who has found another, Jean Louis (Joël Dupuch) awaits messages from his emotionally distant Juliette (Anne Marivin) - and so on. Yet each of these little situations confound Antoine who cannot believe this group would not stay near their critically injured friend Ludo. The consequences are revealing and point out the importance of owning up to the truths that define a life. To reveal the ending would be a disservice to all who may see this little masterpiece.\n\nThe entire cast is of the highest caliber and Canet succeeds in getting brilliant performances from each. Though each actor is excellent, the performances by Benoît Magimel, Marion Cotillard and François Cluzet are exceptional. This is a thinking person's film but one that holds as much brilliant drama and impact as any film before us today.

"Grand Isle" was particularly disappointing, because what originally intrigued me was the trailer. It turned out it's just one of those cases where the trailer is superior to the movie.\n\nSo we got Nicolas Cage as the top-billed star with his character actually being somewhere between the lead and supporting role, we also got 10 minutes of an unimpressive but more than okay Kelsey Grammer, also an average KaDee Strickland as the seductive wife of Nicolas Cage &amp; Luke Benward as the lead character. All of them did an arguably decent job, for the bad things I mostly blame the script. All of the characters are text-book type and just plainly uninspiring, with only Nic Cage channeling a bit of that awesome Cage energy into his character (as he does with any character nowadays). The script, yes, the script is a the major flaw of "Grand Isle". If the visual &amp; technical side of it is fine, average, sure, but fine, then the writing is what truly makes this a cheap B thriller. I'm not even sure if the script was too full of stuff of too void of it - on the surface there are many themes involved, but they're poorly stitched together, nothing surprises, nothing really has an impact &amp; the pacing is, at times, extremely dragging.

"Grand Isle" was particularly disappointing, because what originally intrigued me was the trailer. It turned out it's just one of those cases where the trailer is superior to the movie.\n\nSo we got Nicolas Cage as the top-billed star with his character actually being somewhere between the lead and supporting role, we also got 10 minutes of an unimpressive but more than okay Kelsey Grammer, also an average KaDee Strickland as the seductive wife of Nicolas Cage &amp; Luke Benward as the lead character. All of them did an arguably decent job, for the bad things I mostly blame the script. All of the characters are text-book type and just plainly uninspiring, with only Nic Cage channeling a bit of that awesome Cage energy into his character (as he does with any character nowadays). The script, yes, the script is a the major flaw of "Grand Isle". If the visual &amp; technical side of it is fine, average, sure, but fine, then the writing is what truly makes this a cheap B thriller. I'm not even sure if the script was too full of stuff of too void of it - on the surface there are many themes involved, but they're poorly stitched together, nothing surprises, nothing really has an impact &amp; the pacing is, at times, extremely dragging. Boredom is a risk you have to be willing to take if you're watching "Grand Isle".\n\nYou know, there's not a whole lot I can say or even want to say about "Grand Isle" - It's an underwhelming, unfocused and unoriginal piece of filmmaking, the only redeeming value is bits and pieces of that Cage I really like, but that might just me.

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic. In fact, as the opening titles state, the film is dedicated to "my sister, who made me sit on top of the wardrobe".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a maxim that might equally be applied to Tricks, a film whose well-crafted side-attractions (Tomasz Gassowski's dazzling score, and a rich painterly aesthetic) could divert attention from the finely-tuned engine of the story, ticking away softly in the background as it carries us quietly to our destination.\n\nPrecocious six-year-old Stefek (Damian Ul) lives with his adored teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and his rarely seen, shop-bound mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a sleepy post-Communist town just outside Warsaw. With no friends of his own age, life for Stefak revolves around playing with his tin soldiers on the railway tracks, cadging motorbike rides from his sister's car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), and attempting to discover the precise combination of factors that makes his neighbour's doves fly their coop on a given signal.\n\nOne day, Stefek spots a commuter at the station changing trains whom he convinces himself is their estranged father (Tomasz Sapryk). Although he abandoned his mother when Stefek was just a baby ("trapped by a woman" says Elka), he is able to recognise him from a crumpled and almost completely defaced photograph he carries in his wallet. Though Elka reacts dismissively to his plans, Stefek aims to reunite his parents ("can we reclaim him?") through a game or 'trick' his sister has taught him. As he tells Jerzy, "Careful with her, she knows tricks. She just won't admit it." The trick, which Elka demonstrates in a couple of wonderful vignettes, involves 'bribing' fate - influencing fortune without lifting a finger. All you have to do is announce your intentions to the universe, then sit back while the universe does the job for you. Stefek, however, reckons fate could do with a little shove, and through an ingenious scheme sets out to divert his father off the train platform and straight into his mother's grocery shop.\n\n"Nothing is happening" Stefek glumly tells Elka, after his elaborate plans, involving his tin soldiers, a handful of coins and a flock of doves, seem to have come to nought. Ah, but there always is, his wiser sister replies. "Don't you feel the ground tremble?" It is this sense of something momentous coming, like a train down the tracks, that propels the award-winning Tricks, only the second feature after 2002's 'Zmruz Oczy' ('Squint Your Eyes') for philosophy graduate Andrzej Jakimowski, though it already feels like the work of a more seasoned director.\n\nIndebted to both neo-realist Italian cinema and a gently spellbinding magic realism, Tricks richly succeeds in portraying life from an imaginative child's perspective, in which the most ordinary of objects and places take on an enchanted significance; Fredric Jameson's "poetic transformation of the object world". The importance of local community, and the role it plays in shaping affairs, is often central to the magic realist tradition, and here, Adam Bajerski's lush, golden-hued photography brings Stefan and Elkas's otherwise dingy, working-class mining town to vivid life, with its diverse population of street-sellers, village "sluts" and bird fanciers. Among a cast of non-professional actors, little Damian Ul is terrific as the pugnacious, single-minded Stefek, and Ewelina Walendziak just as good as his slyly practical sister, not long out of girlhood herself but increasingly burdened by adult responsibilities and difficult choices. Their relationship, based on the director's own when he was growing up, feels utterly authentic. In fact, as the opening titles state, the film is dedicated to "my sister, who made me sit on top of the wardrobe".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I don't know if it's just the bad acting or the bad director that made the movie so implausible to follow.\n\nThe actors neither speak or act like people spoke or behaved back in the 1930s.\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes the words "Nazi" and "Hitler" were uttered several times - completely omitting that, back then, the true apprehended menace was the local authorities. Back then, the politics wasn't perceived as being the result of just one single mad man. It was a huge and, back then, popular organization that was ruling the country. I haven't read the original book; probably it's written the same way, but if it does, then it's, too, not using the words that have been used back then and written from a retrospective. So to me, this flic is rather a fictional wannabe than a realistic biopic.\n\nThough I admit the film was portraying only a child's view on the situation, from my point of view it is emotionally quite vapid. All the important moments in the film that might have caused the slightest suspense or compassion were left out. Even the situation where the train conductor checks for the family name is depicted like they were just buying a pound of butter.\n\nWhich brings me to mention the completely irrelevant and petty musical score. I wouldn't call the few dull notes in the movie a "score" anyway. The musical score didn't at all convey any emotion whatsoever.\n\nThe depicted situations all were so nugatory staged and poorly scored, it was often utterly hard to bear. When the family left their mansion at the beginning of the movie I begged for some emotional musical score to convey the loss. But no, why bother viewers with emotion ...\n\nThen, dialogs were often spoken like being read from a text sheet. The intonation was horrible. Important words were hidden in a discharge of words. No pause was disturbing the spate.\n\nThe only exception to the cast was the elder woman playing the housekeeper/nanny. She was acting marvellously, conveying emotions from every word and every micromotion. And I felt the actor depicting the son character acting quite authentic.\n\nFinally, I don't quite unterstand why French scenes were subtitled while the Swiss actors (even the children) were to talk German instead of Swiss German. The children even were dubbed. Well, as I wrote before, the flick was implausible to many regards.\n\nFor everyone who wants to follow a year in a child's live bothered with some relocations but otherwise living a life everyone else lived back then, they will enjoy the movie. But for everyone else, expecting only a fraction of a quality flick like "Der Engel mit der Posaune", they will certainly be disappointed. To me this film is just a plain subsidied direct-to-video quality level production.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Biography","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"f rated,child protagonist,third reich,refugee,triple f rated","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1828241177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIwMWQ1MTgtNDMwOS00NzAzLTgwMTMtZTg0NDBkMGZhODk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIwMWQ1MTgtNDMwOS00NzAzLTgwMTMtZTg0NDBkMGZhODk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8528150/","name":"Riva Krymalowski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6279295/","name":"Marinus Hohmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3231562/","name":"Carla Juri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512862/","name":"Caroline Link"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0248277/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314266/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0504740/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117697/","name":"Anna Brüggemann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1709313/","name":"Judith Kerr"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512862/","name":"Caroline Link"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

According to inequality org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst the poorest 64% of the population control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the milieu of Greed, a hilarious satire from prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom. Examining how the rich get richer, the film focuses on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, Greed doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\n\nSir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan) is one of Britain's richest men. The perma-tanned "self-made" billionaire is the owner of several clothing chains and is known as "the King of the High Street", although a less complimentary nickname is "Greedy" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts 1) his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping and the importance of using foreign sweatshops; 2) in the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains; and, 3) in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash - complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion. Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction - it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and his ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher) are still in love with one another is a theme which never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\n\nFor better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before, and Greed is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people. However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis.

According to inequality org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst the poorest 64% of the population control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the milieu of Greed, a hilarious satire from prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom. Examining how the rich get richer, the film focuses on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, Greed doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\n\nSir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan) is one of Britain's richest men. The perma-tanned "self-made" billionaire is the owner of several clothing chains and is known as "the King of the High Street", although a less complimentary nickname is "Greedy" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts 1) his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping and the importance of using foreign sweatshops; 2) in the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains; and, 3) in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash - complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion. Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA.

And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot.

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

Besides that, it stretches the viewer's ability to empathize with the central character. It tests the viewer's sense of humanity, sense of justice, and his/her levels of tolerance. The viewer is tortured, is made to think beyond his comfortable life, his family, his friends etc. and is forced to think and feel for girls like 'Justine', girls who are forced to forego their self-identities to live under the identity of 'Justine'. Justine symbolizes the millions of innocent girls born free, born to live normal lives but are kidnapped, trafficked, blackmailed and forced into prostitution. Such girls gradually lose the sense of self, lose the sense of identity, sense of being human and begin to believe that they deserve it, that this is what their destiny is, this is what they are made of. How is it justified? Why should such a thing happen to anyone? Is there an escape? Where is hope? Who am I? What am I? If I escape, who will I be? Though the film may not offer answers to these questions, but through the character of Pauline it raises these questions in an effectual manner in the viewer's hearts, making 'Your Name Is Justine' an unforgettable experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":473,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pig,slaughterhouse,toasting with a drink,drinking vodka,male female relationship","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1752088/","name":"Anna Cieslak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295823/","name":"Arno Frisch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533650/","name":"Rafal Mackowiak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143581/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121022/","name":"Chris Burdza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1268993/","name":"Tomasz Kepski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Besides that, it stretches the viewer's ability to empathize with the central character. It tests the viewer's sense of humanity, sense of justice, and his/her levels of tolerance. The viewer is tortured, is made to think beyond his comfortable life, his family, his friends etc. and is forced to think and feel for girls like 'Justine', girls who are forced to forego their self-identities to live under the identity of 'Justine'. Justine symbolizes the millions of innocent girls born free, born to live normal lives but are kidnapped, trafficked, blackmailed and forced into prostitution. Such girls gradually lose the sense of self, lose the sense of identity, sense of being human and begin to believe that they deserve it, that this is what their destiny is, this is what they are made of. How is it justified? Why should such a thing happen to anyone? Is there an escape? Where is hope? Who am I? What am I? If I escape, who will I be? Though the film may not offer answers to these questions, but through the character of Pauline it raises these questions in an effectual manner in the viewer's hearts, making 'Your Name Is Justine' an unforgettable experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":473,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pig,slaughterhouse,toasting with a drink,drinking vodka,male female relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1752088/","name":"Anna Cieslak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295823/","name":"Arno Frisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533650/","name":"Rafal Mackowiak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143581/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121022/","name":"Chris Burdza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1268993/","name":"Tomasz Kepski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

    <desc lang="pl">Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 10136434, Title: Zieja, 
 --- Description: Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

It's been 80 years since THE WIZARD OF OZ was released and 50 years since Judy Garland died. So why do we still care so much? Of course the obvious reason is that, for many generations, her adventures as Dorothy Gale from Kansas marked the first time many of us kids could put ourselves in the shoes (mine weren't ruby sparkles) of a lead character in a movie. Her fantastical journey ignited our imaginations and whisked us away to fight witches and flying monkeys, while making wonderful friends in a corn patch and enchanted forest. Oh, and that voice! However, there is another side to this coin. Judy's story is also an example of the dark and tarnished side of Hollywood ... she pulled back more than one curtain.\n\nRenee Zellweger (Oscar winner for COLD MOUNTAIN, 2003) stars as Judy Garland, and her performance will likely put her in line for her fourth Oscar nomination. The film basically covers the last year of Judy's life, and director Rupert Goold (TRUE STORY, 2015) is working from a script by Tom Edge adapted from Peter Quilter's stage play, "End of the Rainbow". There is no Lollipop Guild here. Instead, the harsh realities of Judy's life are explored. The film opens with Judy and her kids, Joe and Lorna, performing on stage ... and then being unceremoniously denied a room at a nearby luxury hotel. See, Judy's career is in a bad way (admittedly undependable and uninsurable) - as is her health. She is broke, has no home, and offers for roles or performances have dried up. She ends up at her ex-husband Sid Luft's (Rufus Sewell) home, which after some former-spouse bickering, is where the kids stay.\n\nWith no other real prospective gigs, Judy accepts an offer from Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon) to perform at his Talk of the Town theatre in London. Most of the film covers her time in London, and the challenges for all involved. She's 46 years old in the winter of 1968, and though her voice no longer carries the sublime purity of those early years, Judy still has incredible stage presence and an ability to connect with the audience. The challenges occur for her assigned assistant Rosalyn Wilder (who served as a consultant on the film, and is played here by rising star Jessie Buckley), as well as Judy herself. She misses her kids, and is battling loneliness and an addiction to pills - causing her to rarely eat or sleep. When her "friend" (and fifth husband) Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) shows up, Judy's attitude perks up, but her already questionable dependability falters.\n\nFlashbacks to Judy's teenage years at MGM are used to portray how the studio and industry took control of her body, soul and career. Watching studio head Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) bully young Judy (played by newcomer Darci Shaw) by pretending to be a father figure while keeping her weight in line with a diet of cigarettes, diet pills, and soup, is just painful. These scenes, including those with young Judy's frequent co-star Mickey Rooney, help us understand why she was in such a state by the time she hit London. Ms. Zellweger embodies the blend of frailty and determination and talent, as well as the insecurities that simultaneously drove Judy and held her back. Of course, few singers have ever possessed the vocal talent of Judy, but Zellweger admirably brings the appropriate strain and pain to the songs she sings for the movie, including "By Myself" and "The Trolley Song".\n\nBorn Frances Ethel Gumm, Judy Garland first hit the stage at age 2, and never experienced a "normal" childhood or traditional relationship. Despite her immense talent, she was never able to find peace with the pressures of performing. Years of abuse led to an early death, not long after she finished her London run. The film never backs away from the tragic story, but also allows one of the brightest stars of an era to shine through. For those who only know Judy as that homesick girl from Kansas, or maybe also as the rosy-cheeked youngster on the Trolley in the holiday favorite MEET ME IN ST LOUIS (directed by her future husband Vincente Minnelli), there is likely a shock factor in seeing the broken icon in middle age. The film also deals with that always-present bond she had with her audience, especially with the gay community - although a certain sequence of the film seems quite improbable.\n\nFor a film like this to work (it was not sanctioned by Judy's daughter Liza Minnelli), it all rides on the lead performance. Renee Zellweger beautifully captures both the tragic essence and the stunning talent of the late 1960's Judy Garland, an iconic and revered entertainment figure. The film allows us to understand the lifelong mistreatment and heartbreak of this woman, as well as the strength and joy she received while performing live. Balancing the "early" Judy with the "later" Judy was a brilliant way of bringing her life full circle. Ms. Zellweger's performance goes so much deeper than singing on stage ... she embodies the insecurity and frailties of a woman who was never afforded the opportunity to live her own life.\n\nNOTE: There was a 2001 TV mini-series entitled "Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows", based on daughter Lorna Luft's memoir, in which Judy Davis (lip-synching to Ms. Garland's songs) delivered an impressive and Emmy winning performance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"london england,concert,year 1968,ex husband ex wife relationship,sleeplessness","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing !?!?!

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the end all of his films demand that the viewer connects to his concept of the flow of life and death and those aspects of living that make a difference. Les petits mouchoirs AKA Little White Lies magnifies these attributes.

But, this year, before they all leave Paris, their mutual friend Ludo (Jean Dujardin) is hurt in a serious motorcycle accident, ends up the ICU and as the doctors say nothing can be done to change things for at least two weeks, the friends all proceed with their plans for vacation: no one stays behind to be supportive of Ludo, not even his apparent love partner Marie (Marion Cotillard). This sets off a dramatic chain of reactions and emotional responses. The eagerly anticipated vacation leads each of the protagonists to raise the little veils that for years they have draped over what bothers and upsets them. Pretenses become increasingly hard to keep up. Until the moment when the truth finally catches up with them all: each member of the group of friends has a problem that needs the support of real friends but none of them has the ability to share personal secrets. There are many concepts that are present here - one married man Vincent (Benoît Magimel) has an inexplicable physical and emotional attraction to Max who loathes the idea of a possible gay liaison; Marie is visited by an infrequent lover Nassim (Hocine Mérabet), Eric (Gilles Lellouche) longs to be reunited with the woman who has found another, Jean Louis (Joël Dupuch) awaits messages from his emotionally distant Juliette (Anne Marivin) - and so on. Yet each of these little situations confound Antoine who cannot believe this group would not stay near their critically injured friend Ludo. The consequences are revealing and point out the importance of owning up to the truths that define a life.

Though each actor is excellent, the performances by Benoît Magimel, Marion Cotillard and François Cluzet are exceptional. This is a thinking person's film but one that holds as much brilliant drama and impact as any film before us today.

I'd like to say something positive but I really can't think of anything right now. The plot, dialogue, characters, acting, cinematography, lighting, everything was just awful.\n\nI don't usually take note of accents in movies, if the characterisations are fine then I usually just gloss over them. It says a lot that even I noticed how bad and inconsistent these were.\n\nThe backstories were glossed over and only partially explored for the most part with glaring holes in most of them.\n\nThe "hospital" setting was not set up, explained, or even logically consistent. If you don't know who is behind it with a certain name drop, then you won't get any answers here.\n\nJust bad. Bad and a waste of your time. Watch literally anything else. Go for a walk.

She has transplanted the 19th century classic Ukrainian novel into nowadays reality where all Ukrainians recognized themselves and their troubles and guilty pleasures. The whole country has been swept away with the master craft.\n\nNow Mrs. Vorozhbit has made her way into the big screen, and the start is vertiginous. 100 minutes of the grilling movie is painful experience to stomach and to delve into. As Ukraine goes through the catharsis of the war in the East, one might expect that the movie, especially propped up with a dole of public funds, would transgress into a piece claining, albeit subtly, the righteousness of our case.\n\nFar from it. The war is cruel and demanding for both sides, and especially for those caught in between as the DUI-ed headmaster of Popasna School N3 who launches a string of interconnected novellas.\n\nAfter the third episode when the gates of the hell seem to have widely open, you are plunged into the seemingly innocent mild road incident when a strayed hen is killed. Would you expect what you see from a pair of peasants whose rusted shaving razors are piled in a filth sink?\n\nIt is still evident that the dramaturgic power of Vorozhbit, given her experience, still dominates over her cinematography. Details are gripping as the aftertaste and anticipation of more to come from this ascented star of Ukraine's cinema and theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":244,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-05-20","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7223776/","name":"Zoya Baranovskaya"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11937432/","name":"Oksana Cherkashyna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11745645/","name":"Vladimir Gurin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0673519/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0763401/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

She has transplanted the 19th century classic Ukrainian novel into nowadays reality where all Ukrainians recognized themselves and their troubles and guilty pleasures. The whole country has been swept away with the master craft.\n\nNow Mrs. Vorozhbit has made her way into the big screen, and the start is vertiginous. 100 minutes of the grilling movie is painful experience to stomach and to delve into. As Ukraine goes through the catharsis of the war in the East, one might expect that the movie, especially propped up with a dole of public funds, would transgress into a piece claining, albeit subtly, the righteousness of our case.\n\nFar from it. The war is cruel and demanding for both sides, and especially for those caught in between as the DUI-ed headmaster of Popasna School N3 who launches a string of interconnected novellas.\n\nAfter the third episode when the gates of the hell seem to have widely open, you are plunged into the seemingly innocent mild road incident when a strayed hen is killed. Would you expect what you see from a pair of peasants whose rusted shaving razors are piled in a filth sink?\n\nIt is still evident that the dramaturgic power of Vorozhbit, given her experience, still dominates over her cinematography. Details are gripping as the aftertaste and anticipation of more to come from this ascented star of Ukraine's cinema and theater.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":244,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-05-20","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7223776/","name":"Zoya Baranovskaya","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11937432/","name":"Oksana Cherkashyna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11745645/","name":"Vladimir Gurin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0673519/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0763401/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. \n\nQuoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together \n\nHis life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.\n\nHe's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.\n\nHe and his precocious, and "sensitive," daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.\n\nQuoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.\n\nHe also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne "Best Actress 2002" Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. \n\nMysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?\n\n The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us. Proulx creates her story's characters so rich in dimension with that same timeless appeal like a Huck Finn or Nicholas Nickleby, one expects to look them up in the local phone book when in town. But it's the subtle expert performances for subtle yet animated characters make this simply a masterpiece. The award shows are going to be quite redundant this year... A Beautiful Mind and its wonderful cast and performances will be The Shipping News' only competition in the BIG 3 categories - for sure. \n\n Spacey (whom I adore to the point of actually being speechless in front of), brings us, perhaps, his finest performance to date in Quoyle (pronounced coil). Kev reveals Quoyle's soul is wounded and yet his heart, even with all the injustices it has faced in its forty-something years that should be bitter and hard, manages to pound sweet, strong and hopeful. It's an unbelievable performance. Not that I'm surprised This man is a\n\nscrumptious treat for the senses not unlike like fresh fried Ipswich clams drizzled in tarter sauce with a side of old fashioned delectable helping of New England style cole slaw! \n\nWhy's Spacey so great? Is it because he hung with Jack Lemmon in his formative years as an actor? Or because (like myself) he adores the complicated gritty works of Eugene O'Neill? Perhaps, because he makes himself aloof to keep his personality out of his films, thusly making himself completely disappear into the film? Um yeah. Disagree? Get your own review. K-PAX aside, his work always brilliant, intense, or funny, or light it's what ever he wants it to be. I'd breed with the man, sure, but I'm also sure I will not be alone in my admiration for his performance here. Sorry, Russell, your also grand and one helluva actor, but your "butt" has been elegantly drop kicked by Cadet Fowler for the mad mad race for Oscar \n\nJudi Dench is, as always, an inspiration on film. \n\nJulianne Moore (Wavey) worked her plane Jane gorgeous self into a yarn of great depth and feeling. We wanted to make her tea and give her a hug by the end of the film.\n\nCate "I'm in every movie on the marquee this winter" Blanchett is a chameleon- somebody check her body temperature and dining habits! As Quale's rude, nasty, sluty bimbette squared love interest, Petal, she makes you loath her within the first forty-eight frames.\n\nPetal and Quoyle's offspring, little "Bunny", was played by triplets Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer. These gals could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his bubblegum money. They played beside veteran thespians like it was their birthright. You can picture the little dolls finished with their scenes sneaking off to be kids again "please pass the play dough, please, I'm done with my scene mum."\n\nPete "Kobayashi" Postlewaite plays Quoyle's nemesis at the paper with tons of humor and that smoothness of delivery he's so famous for. Love this man.\n\nWelsh and Sheppard's Pie of a manly man, actor Ryhs Ifans ( Little Nicky, Notting Hill) was adorable as Quoyle's new friend B. Beaufield Nutbeem. It was such a pleasure to see him- on so many different levels.\n\n Director, Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog, Cider House Rules) is famous for quirky studies on the human condition. Here he's strung his cast together like a Newfoundland fisherman's net and draws them so tightly together so as not a syllable of dialog slips away. In lesser hands The Shipping News could have been a sentimental sugar encrusted bakers dozen of stale over done leaden donuts.\n\nThere's so many more involved and each deserves accolades for bringing an already warm story to the screen with a remarkable toasty reality that makes you laugh, stir, and wonder  I feel bad for Ron Howard. He finally gets a nod or two and he has to be up against this film. \n\nSnack recommendation: Plain Donuts, fried octopus tentacle sandwiches and tea\n\nHeadline: The Shipping News looms over small cinema. Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim:" for once a film is better than its hype."\n\nBlunt Aside: Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance. After you see the film (which is mandatory) the names will come gloriously into the light.

Love this man.\n\nWelsh and Sheppard's Pie of a manly man, actor Ryhs Ifans ( Little Nicky, Notting Hill) was adorable as Quoyle's new friend B. Beaufield Nutbeem. It was such a pleasure to see him- on so many different levels.\n\n Director, Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog, Cider House Rules) is famous for quirky studies on the human condition. Here he's strung his cast together like a Newfoundland fisherman's net and draws them so tightly together so as not a syllable of dialog slips away. In lesser hands The Shipping News could have been a sentimental sugar encrusted bakers dozen of stale over done leaden donuts.\n\nThere's so many more involved and each deserves accolades for bringing an already warm story to the screen with a remarkable toasty reality that makes you laugh, stir, and wonder  I feel bad for Ron Howard. He finally gets a nod or two and he has to be up against this film. \n\nSnack recommendation: Plain Donuts, fried octopus tentacle sandwiches and tea\n\nHeadline: The Shipping News looms over small cinema. Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim:" for once a film is better than its hype."\n\nBlunt Aside: Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance. After you see the film (which is mandatory) the names will come gloriously into the light. Trust me.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32516,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-12-25","keywords":"newspaper,pantyhose,ship,wake,husband wife relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Shipping News","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2899353113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3ZWUyZjctY2JhMS00YTg4LWIxN2QtZTg1OTM0OTI1MGVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3ZWUyZjctY2JhMS00YTg4LWIxN2QtZTg1OTM0OTI1MGVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698925/","name":"Annie Proulx","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414608/","name":"Robert Nelson Jacobs"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. \n\nQuoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together \n\nHis life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.\n\nHe's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.\n\nHe and his precocious, and "sensitive," daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.\n\nQuoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.\n\nHe also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne "Best Actress 2002" Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. \n\nMysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?\n\n The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us. Proulx creates her story's characters so rich in dimension with that same timeless appeal like a Huck Finn or Nicholas Nickleby, one expects to look them up in the local phone book when in town. But it's the subtle expert performances for subtle yet animated characters make this simply a masterpiece. The award shows are going to be quite redundant this year... A Beautiful Mind and its wonderful cast and performances will be The Shipping News' only competition in the BIG 3 categories - for sure. \n\n Spacey (whom I adore to the point of actually being speechless in front of), brings us, perhaps, his finest performance to date in Quoyle (pronounced coil). Kev reveals Quoyle's soul is wounded and yet his heart, even with all the injustices it has faced in its forty-something years that should be bitter and hard, manages to pound sweet, strong and hopeful. It's an unbelievable performance. Not that I'm surprised This man is a\n\nscrumptious treat for the senses not unlike like fresh fried Ipswich clams drizzled in tarter sauce with a side of old fashioned delectable helping of New England style cole slaw! \n\nWhy's Spacey so great? Is it because he hung with Jack Lemmon in his formative years as an actor? Or because (like myself) he adores the complicated gritty works of Eugene O'Neill? Perhaps, because he makes himself aloof to keep his personality out of his films, thusly making himself completely disappear into the film? Um yeah. Disagree? Get your own review. K-PAX aside, his work always brilliant, intense, or funny, or light it's what ever he wants it to be. I'd breed with the man, sure, but I'm also sure I will not be alone in my admiration for his performance here. Sorry, Russell, your also grand and one helluva actor, but your "butt" has been elegantly drop kicked by Cadet Fowler for the mad mad race for Oscar \n\nJudi Dench is, as always, an inspiration on film. \n\nJulianne Moore (Wavey) worked her plane Jane gorgeous self into a yarn of great depth and feeling. We wanted to make her tea and give her a hug by the end of the film.\n\nCate "I'm in every movie on the marquee this winter" Blanchett is a chameleon- somebody check her body temperature and dining habits! As Quale's rude, nasty, sluty bimbette squared love interest, Petal, she makes you loath her within the first forty-eight frames.\n\nPetal and Quoyle's offspring, little "Bunny", was played by triplets Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer. These gals could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his bubblegum money. They played beside veteran thespians like it was their birthright. You can picture the little dolls finished with their scenes sneaking off to be kids again "please pass the play dough, please, I'm done with my scene mum."\n\nPete "Kobayashi" Postlewaite plays Quoyle's nemesis at the paper with tons of humor and that smoothness of delivery he's so famous for. Love this man.\n\nWelsh and Sheppard's Pie of a manly man, actor Ryhs Ifans ( Little Nicky, Notting Hill) was adorable as Quoyle's new friend B. Beaufield Nutbeem. It was such a pleasure to see him- on so many different levels.\n\n Director, Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog, Cider House Rules) is famous for quirky studies on the human condition. Here he's strung his cast together like a Newfoundland fisherman's net and draws them so tightly together so as not a syllable of dialog slips away. In lesser hands The Shipping News could have been a sentimental sugar encrusted bakers dozen of stale over done leaden donuts.\n\nThere's so many more involved and each deserves accolades for bringing an already warm story to the screen with a remarkable toasty reality that makes you laugh, stir, and wonder  I feel bad for Ron Howard. He finally gets a nod or two and he has to be up against this film. \n\nSnack recommendation: Plain Donuts, fried octopus tentacle sandwiches and tea\n\nHeadline: The Shipping News looms over small cinema. Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim:" for once a film is better than its hype."\n\nBlunt Aside: Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance. After you see the film (which is mandatory) the names will come gloriously into the light.

That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance. After you see the film (which is mandatory) the names will come gloriously into the light.

No more fabulous Technicolor experiments in color, no pulsating score in the vein of Goblin, but instead a stupid decision to retain Argento and Daria Nicolodi's 3 Mothers supernatural story, the weakest element of the show.\n\nI was a huge fan of Argento's "animal" titled thrillers Bird, Cat and Flies, and even owned a 16mm 'Scope print of Four Flies on Grey Velvet back in my movie buff days of the '70s. But I never got into his later supernatural horror shows, while admiring Suspiria for its technical brilliance.\n\nNow remakes are problematic in the first place, and just copying or aping an original like Gus Van Sant did with "Psycho" is an exercise in futility. But I did enjoy both the original "The Initiation of Sarah" and its fine TV remake. These are traditional horror films in the same genre as "Suspiria", set in a female world.\n\nA pornographer would have taken this remake opportunity (called porn-parody in the Adult biz) and used it perhaps for a Sweetheart Video of lesbian porn, with the top young and old actresses having romantic liaisons. "Confessions of a Sinful Nun" is a recent example from Sweetheart of this approach in a non-supernatural nunsploitation vein.\n\nBut Luca opted instead for the sadistic brand of horror porn, meat hooks and all, with plenty of gore and unpleasantness rather than erotic entertainment. His use of urination is yet another example of rejecting sex in favor of other staples of pornography (softcore division). And his casting of several of Europe's best actresses of recent decades goes for naught: Tilda Swinton quite professional in a lousy, paper-thin role; Angela Winkler solid but hardly up to her great work for German directors; Sophie Testud lost in the shuffle along with the fabulous Renee Soutendijk, and only Ingrid Caven allowed one scene of panache near the end. Bringing back Jessica Harper was a good idea, and her scene has some power.\n\nThe many dimly-lit scenes play poorly on the home screen, evidently "artistic" for theatrical runs, of which the movie was one big flop at the boxoffice. The prologue staring Chloe Grace Moretz is terrible: poorly edited, uninvolving and utterly failing to engage the viewer in the story, just a waste of time and footage.\n\nJust when I had gained an interest in a relatively new director thanks to his sensitive gay-themed "Call Me" movie, the guy's feet of clay were revealed here -just another delusional hack."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68109,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-11-02","keywords":"1970s,witches' coven,telepathy,good versus evil,mysterious disappearance","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1749334809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJjNGJkYWEtNjFmOS00M2I5LTg4MjgtZjYzOTdhMGNiMjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJjNGJkYWEtNjFmOS00M2I5LTg4MjgtZjYzOTdhMGNiMjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the artistic director, an ambitious young dancer, and a grieving psychotherapist.

These are traditional horror films in the same genre as "Suspiria", set in a female world.\n\nA pornographer would have taken this remake opportunity (called porn-parody in the Adult biz) and used it perhaps for a Sweetheart Video of lesbian porn, with the top young and old actresses having romantic liaisons. "Confessions of a Sinful Nun" is a recent example from Sweetheart of this approach in a non-supernatural nunsploitation vein.\n\nBut Luca opted instead for the sadistic brand of horror porn, meat hooks and all, with plenty of gore and unpleasantness rather than erotic entertainment. His use of urination is yet another example of rejecting sex in favor of other staples of pornography (softcore division). And his casting of several of Europe's best actresses of recent decades goes for naught: Tilda Swinton quite professional in a lousy, paper-thin role; Angela Winkler solid but hardly up to her great work for German directors; Sophie Testud lost in the shuffle along with the fabulous Renee Soutendijk, and only Ingrid Caven allowed one scene of panache near the end. Bringing back Jessica Harper was a good idea, and her scene has some power.\n\nThe many dimly-lit scenes play poorly on the home screen, evidently "artistic" for theatrical runs, of which the movie was one big flop at the boxoffice. The prologue staring Chloe Grace Moretz is terrible: poorly edited, uninvolving and utterly failing to engage the viewer in the story, just a waste of time and footage.\n\nJust when I had gained an interest in a relatively new director thanks to his sensitive gay-themed "Call Me" movie, the guy's feet of clay were revealed here -just another delusional hack.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68109,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-11-02","keywords":"1970s,witches' coven,telepathy,good versus evil,mysterious disappearance","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1749334809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJjNGJkYWEtNjFmOS00M2I5LTg4MjgtZjYzOTdhMGNiMjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJjNGJkYWEtNjFmOS00M2I5LTg4MjgtZjYzOTdhMGNiMjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the artistic director, an ambitious young dancer, and a grieving psychotherapist.

You can't even call this a black comedy because there is nothing remotely funny about the film but that doesn't mean it's a bad.\n\n It's the story of Inga , who runs a deeply indebted dairy farm in a remote valley in Iceland. After a tragic loss, she decides to rise up against the corrupt establishment exploiting her and the local community. This way the widowed farmer begins a new life on her own terms by fighting against corruption and injustice in her community.\n\nIf this was made in another country like The UK or The US , it would have had humour inserted and would probably had a shmaltzy ending. Obviously that's not what's done in Iceland .\n\nThis is more of a social statement about how small farms are bullied by big corporations and how one woman stood up to that . I enjoyed watching the fight against the Co op and the way the farmers rallied around but without giving anything away , the fight ends up being fruitless which gives us a strange , flat ending.\n\nOverall i was sold a different film from what i got but it was still very watchable .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You can't even call this a black comedy because there is nothing remotely funny about the film but that doesn't mean it's a bad.\n\n It's the story of Inga , who runs a deeply indebted dairy farm in a remote valley in Iceland. After a tragic loss, she decides to rise up against the corrupt establishment exploiting her and the local community. This way the widowed farmer begins a new life on her own terms by fighting against corruption and injustice in her community.\n\nIf this was made in another country like The UK or The US , it would have had humour inserted and would probably had a shmaltzy ending. Obviously that's not what's done in Iceland .\n\nThis is more of a social statement about how small farms are bullied by big corporations and how one woman stood up to that . I enjoyed watching the fight against the Co op and the way the farmers rallied around but without giving anything away , the fight ends up being fruitless which gives us a strange , flat ending.\n\nOverall i was sold a different film from what i got but it was still very watchable .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.\n\nRhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. \n\nThe theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.\n\nThe future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. \n\nIs it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes. We're talking about a movie that lifts words, then says they came from a thief. A bit of a paradox if anything. Similarly, it would be silly for J.J. Abrams to direct a movie that's filled with scenes from every Steven Spielberg film, yet that happened with Super 8.\n\nIf Anonymous has a fault, it would be in jerking around the audience. The movie starts with an inventive use of a framing device, and quite appropriately in a theatre. We go back and Ben Johnson is jailed, only for us to go back 5 years to see him getting jailed. Then we go back another 40 and when we next see Johnson he's being set free. So  in which time is he released? Thankfully Anonymous is long enough to allow an audience to gain bearings.\n\nAnonymous is Emmerich's masterpiece, a radical far from his usual environmental apocalypse works. There could be a stigma surrounding the subject, which will be viewed as blasphemy by many. I'd like to reassure you that most popular cinema is an act of fiction. Shakespeare isn't available to rebut, and most moviegoers are not concerned with historical accuracy so long as the story is compelling and filled with drama, which Anonymous delivers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-28","keywords":"conspiracy theory,william shakespeare character,elizabeth i character,historical fiction,earl of oxford","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10 Reasons Why Shakespeare Is a Fraud","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1157013017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Director Roland Emmerich gives 10 reasons why he believes Shakespeare was a fraud."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000603/","name":"Vanessa Redgrave"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000667/","name":"David Thewlis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650089/","name":"John Orloff"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Set against the backdrop of the succession of Queen Elizabeth I and the Essex rebellion against her.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1521197/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Legendary_Badass","dateCreated":"2011-10-26","inLanguage":"English","name":"Inventive, Compelling, Emmerich's Masterpiece","reviewBody":"The Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) is a talented playwright whose position forces him to publicly abandon his endeavors. He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.\n\nRhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. \n\nThe theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.\n\nThe future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. \n\nIs it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes. We're talking about a movie that lifts words, then says they came from a thief. A bit of a paradox if anything. Similarly, it would be silly for J.J. Abrams to direct a movie that's filled with scenes from every Steven Spielberg film, yet that happened with Super 8.\n\nIf Anonymous has a fault, it would be in jerking around the audience. The movie starts with an inventive use of a framing device, and quite appropriately in a theatre. We go back and Ben Johnson is jailed, only for us to go back 5 years to see him getting jailed. Then we go back another 40 and when we next see Johnson he's being set free. So  in which time is he released? Thankfully Anonymous is long enough to allow an audience to gain bearings.\n\nAnonymous is Emmerich's masterpiece, a radical far from his usual environmental apocalypse works. There could be a stigma surrounding the subject, which will be viewed as blasphemy by many. I'd like to reassure you that most popular cinema is an act of fiction. Shakespeare isn't available to rebut, and most moviegoers are not concerned with historical accuracy so long as the story is compelling and filled with drama, which Anonymous delivers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-28","keywords":"conspiracy theory,william shakespeare character,elizabeth i character,historical fiction,earl of oxford","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10 Reasons Why Shakespeare Is a Fraud","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1157013017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjgyNTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Director Roland Emmerich gives 10 reasons why he believes Shakespeare was a fraud.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000603/","name":"Vanessa Redgrave","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000667/","name":"David Thewlis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650089/","name":"John Orloff"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You can't even call this a black comedy because there is nothing remotely funny about the film but that doesn't mean it's a bad.\n\n It's the story of Inga , who runs a deeply indebted dairy farm in a remote valley in Iceland. After a tragic loss, she decides to rise up against the corrupt establishment exploiting her and the local community. This way the widowed farmer begins a new life on her own terms by fighting against corruption and injustice in her community.\n\nIf this was made in another country like The UK or The US , it would have had humour inserted and would probably had a shmaltzy ending. Obviously that's not what's done in Iceland .\n\nThis is more of a social statement about how small farms are bullied by big corporations and how one woman stood up to that . I enjoyed watching the fight against the Co op and the way the farmers rallied around but without giving anything away , the fight ends up being fruitless which gives us a strange , flat ending.\n\nOverall i was sold a different film from what i got but it was still very watchable .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You can't even call this a black comedy because there is nothing remotely funny about the film but that doesn't mean it's a bad.\n\n It's the story of Inga , who runs a deeply indebted dairy farm in a remote valley in Iceland. After a tragic loss, she decides to rise up against the corrupt establishment exploiting her and the local community. This way the widowed farmer begins a new life on her own terms by fighting against corruption and injustice in her community.\n\nIf this was made in another country like The UK or The US , it would have had humour inserted and would probably had a shmaltzy ending. Obviously that's not what's done in Iceland .\n\nThis is more of a social statement about how small farms are bullied by big corporations and how one woman stood up to that . I enjoyed watching the fight against the Co op and the way the farmers rallied around but without giving anything away , the fight ends up being fruitless which gives us a strange , flat ending.\n\nOverall i was sold a different film from what i got but it was still very watchable .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Every character had to describe every other character as "the best of the best", "the best the agency ever had", "the best I've ever seen".\n\nIf you have to tell your audience someone is the best, then they are probably not. The writers are just getting in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewers to come to their own conclusions., Instead, we're being TOLD everything.\n\nAlso, Queen Latifah is a good actress. She is, however, remarkably miscast in this series. The writers aren't writing to her strengths-- rock solid persona and strong delivery. Instead, they're trying to portray her as a seasoned fighter and are putting her in scenes where she's shown being physically violent. Those scenes fall flat due to the excessive jump cuts needed to compensate for the actress' lack of natural physicality. The classic 80's series did this well-- writing for McCall as a seasoned veteran in his late 50's vs. a modern spec ops warrior. As such, the original McCall used intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon.\n\nThis series could be saved but it needs some heavy reworking. Right now it feels like "Equalizer in Name Only". Branding this as a remake of the original series is a disservice to all involved. Instead, create a brand new character for your very talented lead and stop trying to retread the past.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-02-07","keywords":"justice,fighter,woman warrior,action heroine,one woman army","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457796/","name":"Tory Kittles","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004965/","name":"Adam Goldberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110950/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448397/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

Once upon a time (possibly in Las Vegas) he was a Box Office heavyweight. Now... well, you can probably pick up one of his latest films from those buckets you find of DVDs for £2.99 in petrol stations. However, before his decent into depressingly-bad cinema, he made some pretty fun films. Yes, he's won an Oscar in his time for his deep and meaningful acting, but you won't find any of that here. Just fun.\n\nNicholas Cage plays (basically) Nicholas Cage – only a Nicholas Cage who used to steal expensive cars, only to retire. However, his loose cannon of a brother steals (or doesn't steal – I forget – it doesn't matter!) for (or from) the wrong mobster in L.A. meaning Nicholas Cage the now not-so retired car thief must steal a load of flash motors in one night or his brother ends up in the car crusher (literally!).\n\nIf you like fast cars driving even faster (and, judging by the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise a lot of people do) then this one is basically for you. It's an action film and it's pretty much by the numbers, but, when it's such fun, who cares? Everyone cranks their performances up to eleven and it all comes across as one of those adorable eighties and nineties 'over-the-top' action flicks (yes, I know it was made it in 2000, but it sure feels like a nineties movie) with a real cartoony vibe to it.

 --- Description: Gone in Sixty Seconds: Directed by Dominic Sena. With Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, T.J. Cross. A retired master car thief must come back to the industry and steal fifty cars with his crew in one night to save his brother's life." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0187078/","name":"Gone in Sixty Seconds","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMzExNDEwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMxMzg2._V1_.jpg","description":"A retired master car thief must come back to the industry and steal fifty cars with his crew in one night to save his brother's life.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0187078/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"bowmanblue","dateCreated":"2017-01-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Gone, but not forgotten","reviewBody":"Also, poor Nicholas Cage, I knew him well... Once upon a time (possibly in Las Vegas) he was a Box Office heavyweight. Now... well, you can probably pick up one of his latest films from those buckets you find of DVDs for £2.99 in petrol stations. However, before his decent into depressingly-bad cinema, he made some pretty fun films. Yes, he's won an Oscar in his time for his deep and meaningful acting, but you won't find any of that here. Just fun.\n\nNicholas Cage plays (basically) Nicholas Cage – only a Nicholas Cage who used to steal expensive cars, only to retire. However, his loose cannon of a brother steals (or doesn't steal – I forget – it doesn't matter!) for (or from) the wrong mobster in L.A. meaning Nicholas Cage the now not-so retired car thief must steal a load of flash motors in one night or his brother ends up in the car crusher (literally!).\n\nIf you like fast cars driving even faster (and, judging by the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise a lot of people do) then this one is basically for you. It's an action film and it's pretty much by the numbers, but, when it's such fun, who cares? Everyone cranks their performances up to eleven and it all comes across as one of those adorable eighties and nineties 'over-the-top' action flicks (yes, I know it was made it in 2000, but it sure feels like a nineties movie) with a real cartoony vibe to it. You have Christopher Ecleston plays the 'evil Brit villain' much like any other evil Brit villains you've seen in cinema. Vinnie Jones and Angelina Jolie are on hand to show their faces, but feel a little underused for what they could have been.\n\nUltimately, it's all on Nicholas Cage's manic shoulders and he does the film proud.

Not sure if you could (or should) compare him to early Jack Black, but if you do that analogy/comparison on the degree of how funny they are, I guess you can. Although Gad seems a bit more low key of course (and not only in this, but other movies he did).\n\nZach is doing his usual thing, which isn't bad, but might feel a bit like the same to viewers. And still the movie is able to get you towards the end, if you have a soft spot for drama. Like I said, I credit Gad mostly for that, but the kid actors are not bad either. This drama is not as good as some others I watched in 2014, but it's more than decent enough","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37578,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-07-25","keywords":"dream sequence,crowdfunded,sex scene,furry,office worker","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1612557593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Aidan Bloom, a struggling actor, father, and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find a purpose for his life.

Not sure if you could (or should) compare him to early Jack Black, but if you do that analogy/comparison on the degree of how funny they are, I guess you can. Although Gad seems a bit more low key of course (and not only in this, but other movies he did).\n\nZach is doing his usual thing, which isn't bad, but might feel a bit like the same to viewers. And still the movie is able to get you towards the end, if you have a soft spot for drama. Like I said, I credit Gad mostly for that, but the kid actors are not bad either. This drama is not as good as some others I watched in 2014, but it's more than decent enough","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37578,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-07-25","keywords":"dream sequence,crowdfunded,sex scene,furry,office worker","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1612557593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Aidan Bloom, a struggling actor, father, and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find a purpose for his life.

We see this inverted flight captured in the trailer, but believe it or not this is not the most provocative element of this film. The story is so thought provoking that it will have you walking out of the theater questioning whether or not you could or would choose nobility over self-preservation. Most of what takes place behind the scenes looming like a predator waiting to strike is the blame game, with Whip continuously asserting that no one could have landed that plane except him. That point is supported but it's the collateral damage of his arrogance that is at the forefront of determining liability. The trailer also lets the audience in on the fact that Whip is found to have alcohol in his system as is discussed with Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) who is the attorney brought in to defend Whip on behalf of the Pilot's association. Hugh was very straight and very narrow, which was the case with most of the characters aside from Whip. It was the dichotomy of Whip's persona so brilliantly conveyed in his mannerisms, responses, and facial expressions that makes the performance Oscar, Golden Globe, BET, Trumpet, Image, MTV and any other awards worthy. If Mr. Washington had uttered eight bars I would say he deserves a Hip Hop award or a Grammy, he was that convincing. I recognized this person that Mr. Washington portrayed so true to life, which is not just a testament to good writing, but mostly to the phenomenal acting talent that is Denzel. All the characteristics that made this individual a hero were the same characteristics that could potentially make him infamous. I will say that I as well as many fans am always open to greater insight into who Denzel is, however the rear view was totally unnecessary. The film does a great job of telling a story about the human condition, nobody is one dimensional and sometimes extreme circumstances make you write yourself a reality check. The question is when you cash that check will you be happy with the results. If you have any fear of flying this is not the movie for you. It will reinforce that fear and possibly cause you to swear off flying altogether. I give this film a green light.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":337404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-12","keywords":"stewardess,pilot,airplane crash,airplane pilot,flight attendant","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2384176153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjAzNTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ2MTA2OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjAzNTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ2MTA2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling.

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise.

What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. \n\nFor starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. \n\nThe creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. \n\nHowever there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. \n\nStill these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again.

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.\n\nChanning Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.\n\nLike Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.\n\nAs du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.\n\nFoxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138290,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.\n\nFoxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138290,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how "pretty" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. \n\nOverall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it.

So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how "pretty" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. \n\nOverall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it.

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle ","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0455824/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Tony Dummett","dateCreated":"2009-06-13","inLanguage":"English","name":"Wonderful Movie - remember to check your disbelief at the door.","reviewBody":"Having resisted the urge to see Australia for many months, I finally hired the Blu Ray version because my mother in law was staying over for the night. I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You should see it. Its all about the writing, though.\n\nMcCarthy's writing style comes after the Clancy/Ludlum model where things are diced into parallel episodes but unified in a grand arc driven by the cosmic principle that good triumphs and the bad guys get punished. This has become the cinematic norm, so whenever we pass through a scene-story, we know how it fits in a universe powered by a machine of justice.\n\nMcCarthy has the intelligence to open the world, introducing into his novels the notion of apparently unraveled justice. We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.\n\nBut its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.\n\nThe other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That "viewing" piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice. \n\nIts all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.\n\nSo why am I unhappy?\n\nBecause the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.\n\nHere, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled. \n\nYes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for?

In fall of 1991 Thurgood Marshall retired from SCOTUS, and, feeling the pressure to nominate a black man to the court, Bush picked Clarence Thomas, a man who many felt wasn't qualified for the court (as Jeffrey Wright's character says at one point, "I have students who are better qualified than Clarence Thomas"). But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions. It got out to the press, she had to go testify, as did Thomas, and all this before a seemingly immovable date for the man's confirmation.\n\nThis all could have made for a compelling mini-series, or an even longer movie. What is a little disappointing about is that this is probably the best this kind of movie could be, but it's still not quite good enough, or I should say that the detail isn't exactly strong enough. Mostly I found that the depiction of Clarence Thomas not exactly weak but basic: for such a man who I may find reprehensible (from before and during his 25 past years on the court), Wendell Pierce gives Thomas as a person, and character in this story, some dignity, and Anita Wright as Clarence Thomas' wife as well. But what about anything else aside from his indignation and sad faces? What else was/is there to Thomas? \n\nMaybe that just wasn't the focus, and director Fumiyama (of last year's surprise critical hit Dope), wanted to keep it on the politics and especially the media - many figures who you might recognize from CNN and elsewhere in cable news pop up as younger selves - certainly keeps a good eye on that. But what does make an impact and what is certainly good to look past the flaws here, are a) Kerry Washington's performance, which is so unwavering in making Anita Hill a figure of sympathy but also aching empathy, completely stripping anything else except this woman and having to put up being solid in front of the committee. And b) how the story and movie treats the whole aspect of how equal rights were not there in 1991, and may still not be (or, to put it another way, despite the changes the struggle is ongoing), for women in this country.\n\nLike the recent People vs OJ series, we get a story that seems to deal a lot in race - Thomas' "High tech lynching" comment that struck an emotional chord for some but was seen as being disingenuous by others - and yet it's really about how women fit it, or certainly do not, in a world full of men. Images of women and how they talk and react, every little thing that they say, is under the kind of scrutiny here that men just don't have to face, at least not to this level. Confirmation is about the representation of a woman's image in politics, in the media, in the public at large, and what that does when up against a "street fight" as one of the raging white male Republican senators says. You can read a lot into what the hearings, as seen in this story, say about the national public character, and yet it's displayed for us to see in those hearings, and the behind-the-scenes fights and digging for dirt via the Republican senators, as opposed to spelled out all the time.\n\nConfirmation doesn't stretch entirely too far for it to be great, or quite on the level of Recount or Game Change as far as HBO original movies about hot-button/controversial political stories in this country from the modern age, but within what it tries to do, and from the acting from all the players that is never less than convincing (Kinnear, who plays a rather unsympathetic Senator Biden, who screwed up things in the hearing just as far as scheduling people to testify, is one of those), it works. I'd even watch it again if just to see how Washington pulls off the majority of her scenes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-16","keywords":"supreme court,1990s,reference to anita hill,african american judge,black male judge","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3610293529","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States' Supreme Court is called into question when former colleague, Anita Hill, testifies that he had sexually harassed her."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913488/","name":"Kerry Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682495/","name":"Wendell Pierce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266622/","name":"Rick Famuyiwa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173527/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335666/","name":"Susannah Grant"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States Supreme Court is called into question when Anita Hill, a former colleague, testifies that he sexually harassed her." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt4608402/","name":"Confirmation","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MjMwMDkyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTY2ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States Supreme Court is called into question when Anita Hill, a former colleague, testifies that he sexually harassed her.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt4608402/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Quinoa1984","dateCreated":"2016-04-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"not great, but its story speaks volumes","reviewBody":"The bottom line with Confirmation is that it's not complex as far as the plot goes, and this is particularly if you know the history. In fall of 1991 Thurgood Marshall retired from SCOTUS, and, feeling the pressure to nominate a black man to the court, Bush picked Clarence Thomas, a man who many felt wasn't qualified for the court (as Jeffrey Wright's character says at one point, "I have students who are better qualified than Clarence Thomas"). But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions. It got out to the press, she had to go testify, as did Thomas, and all this before a seemingly immovable date for the man's confirmation.\n\nThis all could have made for a compelling mini-series, or an even longer movie. What is a little disappointing about is that this is probably the best this kind of movie could be, but it's still not quite good enough, or I should say that the detail isn't exactly strong enough. Mostly I found that the depiction of Clarence Thomas not exactly weak but basic: for such a man who I may find reprehensible (from before and during his 25 past years on the court), Wendell Pierce gives Thomas as a person, and character in this story, some dignity, and Anita Wright as Clarence Thomas' wife as well. But what about anything else aside from his indignation and sad faces? What else was/is there to Thomas? \n\nMaybe that just wasn't the focus, and director Fumiyama (of last year's surprise critical hit Dope), wanted to keep it on the politics and especially the media - many figures who you might recognize from CNN and elsewhere in cable news pop up as younger selves - certainly keeps a good eye on that. But what does make an impact and what is certainly good to look past the flaws here, are a) Kerry Washington's performance, which is so unwavering in making Anita Hill a figure of sympathy but also aching empathy, completely stripping anything else except this woman and having to put up being solid in front of the committee. And b) how the story and movie treats the whole aspect of how equal rights were not there in 1991, and may still not be (or, to put it another way, despite the changes the struggle is ongoing), for women in this country.\n\nLike the recent People vs OJ series, we get a story that seems to deal a lot in race - Thomas' "High tech lynching" comment that struck an emotional chord for some but was seen as being disingenuous by others - and yet it's really about how women fit it, or certainly do not, in a world full of men. Images of women and how they talk and react, every little thing that they say, is under the kind of scrutiny here that men just don't have to face, at least not to this level. Confirmation is about the representation of a woman's image in politics, in the media, in the public at large, and what that does when up against a "street fight" as one of the raging white male Republican senators says. You can read a lot into what the hearings, as seen in this story, say about the national public character, and yet it's displayed for us to see in those hearings, and the behind-the-scenes fights and digging for dirt via the Republican senators, as opposed to spelled out all the time.\n\nConfirmation doesn't stretch entirely too far for it to be great, or quite on the level of Recount or Game Change as far as HBO original movies about hot-button/controversial political stories in this country from the modern age, but within what it tries to do, and from the acting from all the players that is never less than convincing (Kinnear, who plays a rather unsympathetic Senator Biden, who screwed up things in the hearing just as far as scheduling people to testify, is one of those), it works. I'd even watch it again if just to see how Washington pulls off the majority of her scenes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-16","keywords":"supreme court,1990s,reference to anita hill,african american judge,black male judge","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3610293529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States' Supreme Court is called into question when former colleague, Anita Hill, testifies that he had sexually harassed her.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913488/","name":"Kerry Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682495/","name":"Wendell Pierce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266622/","name":"Rick Famuyiwa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173527/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335666/","name":"Susannah Grant"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into serious films or family friendly comedies.

You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).\n\nNow the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&amp;Ms.\n\nEmma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face ("now act SURPRISED" - "now show us a sense of WONDER" - "now look SAD"). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they spend the 200 million budget on?\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity for Disney.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Fantasy","Musical"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).\n\nNow the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&amp;Ms.\n\nEmma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face ("now act SURPRISED" - "now show us a sense of WONDER" - "now look SAD"). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they spend the 200 million budget on?\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity for Disney.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Family","Fantasy","Musical"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

And there are flaws or at least weird decisions along the way ... but it is a comedy and it tries to be as funny as it can be overall.\n\nThat out of the way, I had no idea what the movie would be like or any story element, so color me shocked and surprised by the inciting incident at the start of the movie. I did not see that coming/happening. After that "bang" the movie takes a minute to breathe a little bit and that is the moment you see the human in our main character. Overall we get quite a few of cliches though, but still it does its best to stay on the right side of funny and delicate when it touches certain subjects. Funny but predictable - still entertaining if you let it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1630,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"disability,wilhelm scream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Die Goldfische","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3829447705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiZjViMDctZWE0Mi00NDdlLThjYzQtN2Q3YWQ0NjEyMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiZjViMDctZWE0Mi00NDdlLThjYzQtN2Q3YWQ0NjEyMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771713/","name":"Tom Schilling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1678891/","name":"Klaas Heufer-Umlauf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3474804/","name":"Lisa Bitter"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2285783/","name":"Alireza Golafshan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008261/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2285783/","name":"Alireza Golafshan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1487045/","name":"Justyna Müsch"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If I had went to the theater to see this, I would be trying to get my money back. I gave it a 3 only because of the nostalgia I have for Aquaman.

While it's not a "great" film by any stretch, it is a solidly good one. It is also Michael Bay's most *RESTRAINED* film (which isn't saying much, but it's a FAR cry better than the last four Transformers films).\n\nBut, getting to the title of my comment, when I went back and watched this film for the second time (today, February 16, 2019), I felt compelled to pull up IMDb on my phone during the viewing and I checked out some of the user reviews. I found one thing shockingly in common among all of the one-star "reviews":\n\nNot a single one of them had any knowledge of the events of the true incident! And it was painfully obvious that they could not have been bothered to do a little research before making their inane comments public. Many did not know the name of the militant group that attacked the compound (Ansar al-Sharia), and just randomly decided that it must be ISIS. Some felt that it was a condemnation on Hillary Clinton and her actions/lack of actions as the events unfolded (there was not a single mention of Secretary Clinton throughout the entire film, good or bad). One did not even understand why the name of the film is "13 Hours" (seriously, did they even bother to actually WATCH the film before adding their "thoughts" in a blatant effort to only try to bring down the rating percentage?)!\n\nIs the film accurate? Of course not. When a movie is based on a true event, dramatic license is and ALWAYS has been used to make the film more compelling to viewers. And say what you will about Michael Bay's films, but the guy can masterfully direct action set pieces; each one expertly realized to get the viewer's heart pumping. Here, he does it again and again. Or, more accurately, two straight hours after the first bullets start flying to the bitter end.\n\nIt's not a definitive history lesson on what actually happened, but it is decidedly riveting and Bay's most mature film to date. One can only hope that now he's left the directorial duties of the abyssmally and increasingly brainless "Transformers" franchise to other people, maybe we can start getting more films like this from him so people can remember what he is actually capable of when he gets material to work with that he takes seriously and treats it as such.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":129232,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-01-20","keywords":"libya,mercenary,u.s. ambassador,cia agent,car chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi481015065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2OTI0MTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2OTI0MTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An American Ambassador is killed during an attack at a U.S. compound in Libya as a security team struggles to make sense out of the chaos."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1024677/","name":"John Krasinski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032567/","name":"Pablo Schreiber"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0197647/","name":"James Badge Dale"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049752/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353561/","name":"Chuck Hogan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4021083/","name":"Mitchell Zuckoff"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I found one thing shockingly in common among all of the one-star "reviews":\n\nNot a single one of them had any knowledge of the events of the true incident! And it was painfully obvious that they could not have been bothered to do a little research before making their inane comments public. Many did not know the name of the militant group that attacked the compound (Ansar al-Sharia), and just randomly decided that it must be ISIS. Some felt that it was a condemnation on Hillary Clinton and her actions/lack of actions as the events unfolded (there was not a single mention of Secretary Clinton throughout the entire film, good or bad). One did not even understand why the name of the film is "13 Hours" (seriously, did they even bother to actually WATCH the film before adding their "thoughts" in a blatant effort to only try to bring down the rating percentage?)!\n\nIs the film accurate? Of course not. When a movie is based on a true event, dramatic license is and ALWAYS has been used to make the film more compelling to viewers. And say what you will about Michael Bay's films, but the guy can masterfully direct action set pieces; each one expertly realized to get the viewer's heart pumping. Here, he does it again and again. Or, more accurately, two straight hours after the first bullets start flying to the bitter end.\n\nIt's not a definitive history lesson on what actually happened, but it is decidedly riveting and Bay's most mature film to date. One can only hope that now he's left the directorial duties of the abyssmally and increasingly brainless "Transformers" franchise to other people, maybe we can start getting more films like this from him so people can remember what he is actually capable of when he gets material to work with that he takes seriously and treats it as such.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":129232,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-01-20","keywords":"libya,mercenary,u.s. ambassador,cia agent,car chase","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi481015065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2OTI0MTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2OTI0MTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An American Ambassador is killed during an attack at a U.S. compound in Libya as a security team struggles to make sense out of the chaos.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1024677/","name":"John Krasinski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032567/","name":"Pablo Schreiber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0197647/","name":"James Badge Dale"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049752/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353561/","name":"Chuck Hogan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4021083/","name":"Mitchell Zuckoff"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Couldn't help but think Farley wasn't all that fat in this movie, for all the fat jokes.\n\nError alert: almost immediately after Mike falls on Steve in the bunk bed scene, the bed is magically in one piece.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38557,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1996-02-02","keywords":"clumsiness,embarrassment,political campaign,slapstick comedy,politics","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3586310425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","description":"A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000394/","name":"Chris Farley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005450/","name":"David Spade","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001513/","name":"Tim Matheson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790715/","name":"Penelope Spheeris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The camera-work is jerky, the dialogue repetitive and inane and the action virtually non-existent. At times confusing, annoying, irritating and tedious, this film is nonetheless a brilliant piece of arthouse experimental film-making. This movie is virtually all style-there's hardly any plot, no real action, no semblance of a real script-and one that works on a deeper psychological level than the standard mainstream horror film. Indeed, only the very last image in the film is truly frightening, and only if it can be correlated to an incident at the very beginning. The rest of it only becomes scary afterwards, when the audience has had time to consider what they've seen. It is groundbreaking, manipulative cinema made without a script, with an amateur cast and with little or no post-production values. This is a remarkable film which can only really be appreciated, if the accompanying hype is overlooked, as a unique, avant-garde art film and not the regular Hollywood stock it was presented as to the public."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":243401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-11-24","keywords":"found footage,lost in the woods,supernatural horror,ghost story,maryland","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Blair Witch Project","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi9044249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser Trailer for The Blair Witch Project"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231946/","name":"Heather Donahue"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931321/","name":"Michael C.

 --- Description: The Blair Witch Project: Directed by Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez. With Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael C. Williams, Bob Griffin. Three film students vanish after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend, leaving only their footage behind." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0185937/","name":"The Blair Witch Project","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ1NDBlNDItMDAyYS00YTI2LTgwMmYtMzAwMzg4NDFlM2ZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Three film students vanish after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend, leaving only their footage behind.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0185937/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Goreripper","dateCreated":"2000-06-21","inLanguage":"English","name":"Not your average horror film","reviewBody":"A film which fell foul of its own publicity machine, `The Blair Witch Project' was abhorred and derided by the mainstream film-going public which it became unfortunately directed at due to its extraordinary and outlandish marketing campaign. `The Blair Witch Project' is not a typical film that the typical cinema-going public would normally be exposed to. The camera-work is jerky, the dialogue repetitive and inane and the action virtually non-existent. At times confusing, annoying, irritating and tedious, this film is nonetheless a brilliant piece of arthouse experimental film-making. This movie is virtually all style-there's hardly any plot, no real action, no semblance of a real script-and one that works on a deeper psychological level than the standard mainstream horror film. Indeed, only the very last image in the film is truly frightening, and only if it can be correlated to an incident at the very beginning. The rest of it only becomes scary afterwards, when the audience has had time to consider what they've seen. It is groundbreaking, manipulative cinema made without a script, with an amateur cast and with little or no post-production values. This is a remarkable film which can only really be appreciated, if the accompanying hype is overlooked, as a unique, avant-garde art film and not the regular Hollywood stock it was presented as to the public.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":243401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-11-24","keywords":"found footage,lost in the woods,supernatural horror,ghost story,maryland","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Blair Witch Project","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi9044249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser Trailer for The Blair Witch Project","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231946/","name":"Heather Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931321/","name":"Michael C.

It was also very interesting to see a place I had never heard of and to discover that the Grand Hotel Pupp really exists.I'll bet the jet set will end up going to the Czech Republic now","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30265,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-09-13","keywords":"fatal disease,department store,businessman,reference to elton john,hotel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Last Holiday","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3173492249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM5NGU3NzQtNmZkNi00NTZlLWFmZjQtMjE4M2I2NThhZDk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM5NGU3NzQtNmZkNi00NTZlLWFmZjQtMjE4M2I2NThhZDk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005112/","name":"LL Cool J","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000459/","name":"Timothy Hutton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911061/","name":"Wayne Wang"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139808/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038131/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696949/","name":"Jeffrey Price","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780620/","name":"Peter S.

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever  I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending. If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' "Oscar" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.\n\nDerek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-02-27","keywords":"male model,fashion model,conspiracy,fashion,malaysia","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852132/","name":"Christine Taylor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045189/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766153/","name":"Drake Sather"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357453/","name":"John Hamburg"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Also.. the characters in this show are Stupid... and I do mean stupid with a capital S... characters. Seriously... Nobody is this clueless. \n\nThe entire theory of the show seems to be that the bad guys are bad guys because everyone on the planet is so dumb that they haven't noticed the idiotic stunts they've pulled. The show also seems bent on portraying the kids as mentally challenged too. Sure one of them has some tech savvy but, seriously... some of the 'mistakes' they made are 3rd grader nonsense, not high school. \n\nNot believable at all. And I'm pretty forgiving of most marvel titles. I've liked a lot of them just fine. This one is just... awful.\n\nNot sure how the critics are rating this so high. It's absolutely NOT that great a show... it's not even that good a show... it's borderline awful. \n\nWatch it if you have some time to kill and nothing else decent is on... that's about the only advice I can give.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23815,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-11-21","keywords":"shared universe,superheroine,teenager,super villain,marvel cinematic universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7968341/","name":"Rhenzy Feliz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4555391/","name":"Lyrica Okano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4722966/","name":"Virginia Gardner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0213225/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0218858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335634/","name":"Stephanie Savage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0777300/","name":"Josh Schwartz"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3938893593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk4NDA0OGMtNGI2Yi00OWQyLWEzYjMtZmJiOWNkZDViNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk4NDA0OGMtNGI2Yi00OWQyLWEzYjMtZmJiOWNkZDViNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Season 3, the Runaways frantically search for their captured friends Chase, Gert, and Karolina.

It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it. But of course it came too late and now the show has been cancelled after it just started to find its footing.\n\nContrary to some other comments I've seen, Enterprise did NOT use its cast to its fullest potential. Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something. Reed was just starting to get some good stuff this season. Enterprise had a wonderful opportunity to connect every Trek series together and revitalize the franchise but all it did (and most people believe this) was bury it. Despite Enterprise's accomplishments, its failures reign supreme. As much as I love Trek, it needs a rest. Maybe after a few years it will be brought back by people who have new ideas to bring to it. Then, hopefully, we will truly go where no one has gone before."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"earth starship,earthling,terran,space explorer,earthman","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000836/","name":"Scott Bakula"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082517/","name":"John Billingsley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086883/","name":"Jolene Blalock"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094909/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053559/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103804/","name":"Brannon Braga"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Blu-Ray Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2275393049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Bruce Willis plays Art Jeffries, an FBI agent with attitude. Miko Hughes plays Simon Lynch, an autistic savant with a gift for codebreaking. Both are believable but Miko Hughes is astonishing – one of the best ever screen performances by a child. The scenes between the pair of them are really touching and you can believe that Willis really likes kids. Perhaps he does.\n\nThe US government's pursuit of Lynch in this film may at first appear overly far-fetched and scaremongering. Then you remember the US attitude towards the British savant, Gary McKinnon, who was accused of perpetrating the biggest military computer hack of all time by hacking into 97 US military and NASA computers in 2002. Well, they didn't kill his mum and dad, and hunt him like an animal. But after 10 years of attempted extradition, and speculation of a 70-year jail term, maybe this story is just an exaggeration of reality, and not quite as ridiculous as some commentators have suggested.\n\nIt's not really a downside but if you come to this film expecting a shoot-em-up action movie, you may be disappointed. It's much more than that and consequently slower – it's a touching drama with action scenes, and so we can forgive, just about, the pace through the middle of the film. The writing is actually very good and Pearson, Konner and Rosenthal all deserve credit.\n\nI did find the score a bit distracting. Sort of 'too big' and too 'James Bond' for the film. Scenes without music were better. Though the music being played at the club Jeffries visits was really good and I would have liked to have heard more of Koko Taylor (now no longer with us) belting out some blues.\n\nI was finding it difficult to see where this film was going. When Wills is with a kid, like in 16 blocks or Die Hard 4, you expect a visible end point, and there wasn't one. There was a sense of going around in circles. Until the last 5 minutes. Ultimately that cost it a couple of stars and the score lost another one. So seven out of ten for this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1998-04-03","keywords":"autistic child,autism,assassin,9 year old,hospital","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400816/","name":"Miko Hughes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000887/","name":"Harold Becker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0669379/","name":"Ryne Douglas Pearson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0465199/","name":"Lawrence Konner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0742797/","name":"Mark Rosenthal"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Bruce Willis plays Art Jeffries, an FBI agent with attitude. Miko Hughes plays Simon Lynch, an autistic savant with a gift for codebreaking. Both are believable but Miko Hughes is astonishing – one of the best ever screen performances by a child. The scenes between the pair of them are really touching and you can believe that Willis really likes kids. Perhaps he does.\n\nThe US government's pursuit of Lynch in this film may at first appear overly far-fetched and scaremongering. Then you remember the US attitude towards the British savant, Gary McKinnon, who was accused of perpetrating the biggest military computer hack of all time by hacking into 97 US military and NASA computers in 2002. Well, they didn't kill his mum and dad, and hunt him like an animal. But after 10 years of attempted extradition, and speculation of a 70-year jail term, maybe this story is just an exaggeration of reality, and not quite as ridiculous as some commentators have suggested.\n\nIt's not really a downside but if you come to this film expecting a shoot-em-up action movie, you may be disappointed. It's much more than that and consequently slower – it's a touching drama with action scenes, and so we can forgive, just about, the pace through the middle of the film. The writing is actually very good and Pearson, Konner and Rosenthal all deserve credit.\n\nI did find the score a bit distracting. Sort of 'too big' and too 'James Bond' for the film. Scenes without music were better. Though the music being played at the club Jeffries visits was really good and I would have liked to have heard more of Koko Taylor (now no longer with us) belting out some blues.\n\nI was finding it difficult to see where this film was going. When Wills is with a kid, like in 16 blocks or Die Hard 4, you expect a visible end point, and there wasn't one. There was a sense of going around in circles. Until the last 5 minutes. Ultimately that cost it a couple of stars and the score lost another one. So seven out of ten for this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1998-04-03","keywords":"autistic child,autism,assassin,9 year old,hospital","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400816/","name":"Miko Hughes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000887/","name":"Harold Becker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0669379/","name":"Ryne Douglas Pearson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0465199/","name":"Lawrence Konner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0742797/","name":"Mark Rosenthal"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm not sure why IMDb has not posted the names of the stars as the series is no longer in production and is currently airing and even the Colin Ferguson page on IMDb does not list this show in his credits.(?) \n\nSo if you like your sci-fi with a little humor and some genuine caring about the characters, its hard to find a more worthy show than EUReKA!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-07-18","keywords":"scientist,problem solving,pacific northwest,small town,alternate reality","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272399/","name":"Colin Ferguson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724757/","name":"Salli Richardson-Whitfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1569714/","name":"Erica Cerra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184676/","name":"Andrew Cosby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1958727/","name":"Jaime Paglia"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eureka: The Complete Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3793855769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Eureka: The Complete Series"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most of the time though, their output is rarely above mediocre and even often terrible, the worst without any redeeming qualities. Yet there is something compulsive about their relatively consistent badness, speaking as somebody who does not actually mind low-budget and can get enjoyment out of this kind of story, as long as some kind of effort is obvious.\n\n'Monster Island', starting off on a kind note or at least an attempt an honest attempt of a kind note if it doesn't come over that year, is not one of The Asylum's worst. Nowhere near, although there is hardly anything good in 'Monster Island' to me (did have to look hard for them too) it isn't completely irredeemable like their worst efforts are. This is from personal perspective of course. Still found it monstrously bad, the flaws are many, almost every other way, and they are not small, huge actually. Saying this with regret not malice, and there is much more to the problem than being derivative.\n\nIts least bad asset is the production design, the one asset where effort was obvious. Though this is only marginally so rather than significantly so. A particularly good job was done with the caves as has been said already. Some of the photography was okay.\n\nElsewhere, the production values were really poorly done and that the film was made on the cheap is obvious. It looks pretty drab, but it's the disorganised looking editing and last minute looking visual effects, that would even look out of date in the 50s, that come off worst. The submarine is used poorly and there is nothing authentic about it, it didn't look like a submarine and looked like it was filmed in a tank. What can be remembered of the music has very little presence and the film might as better well not had music at all because it didn't fit, added nothing and wouldn't have sounded appealing on its own.\n\nWas expecting little from the script, and it turned out to be worse than expected with the cheese and awkwardness too frequently being rather hard to take. Predictability was hardly unexpected and would have tolerated it, providing that there was some degree of fun and suspense. Unfortunately, 'Monster Island' completely failed to be fun, even on a guilty pleasure level, and the stupidity became intelligence-insulting and exhausting after a while. The suspense was also absent and the whole film felt dreary. The monster action is limited, or at least what the underused creatures are given to do. What there was leaves one confused, bored and shouting at the screen in frustration and the creatures have little personality let alone menace or soul.\n\nGot the sense that the director Mark Atkins had little plan of how to direct or structure 'Monster Island' or what to do with it or that his heart was barely in it. The characters were neither interesting or worth rooting for, there is so little to them in personality or development, their nonsensical decision making is both frustrating and disreacting and how they're written has been seen before many times. The acting is poor at best, the biggest name being Eric Roberts who acts like a sleepwalking robot.\n\nConcluding, very bad. 2/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":582,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-06-01","keywords":"sea monster,helicopter,submarine,psychotronic film,underwater scene","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3779051289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000616/","name":"Eric Roberts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865084/","name":"Toshi Toda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345685/","name":"Adrian Bouchet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is from personal perspective of course. Still found it monstrously bad, the flaws are many, almost every other way, and they are not small, huge actually. Saying this with regret not malice, and there is much more to the problem than being derivative.\n\nIts least bad asset is the production design, the one asset where effort was obvious. Though this is only marginally so rather than significantly so. A particularly good job was done with the caves as has been said already. Some of the photography was okay.\n\nElsewhere, the production values were really poorly done and that the film was made on the cheap is obvious. It looks pretty drab, but it's the disorganised looking editing and last minute looking visual effects, that would even look out of date in the 50s, that come off worst. The submarine is used poorly and there is nothing authentic about it, it didn't look like a submarine and looked like it was filmed in a tank. What can be remembered of the music has very little presence and the film might as better well not had music at all because it didn't fit, added nothing and wouldn't have sounded appealing on its own.\n\nWas expecting little from the script, and it turned out to be worse than expected with the cheese and awkwardness too frequently being rather hard to take. Predictability was hardly unexpected and would have tolerated it, providing that there was some degree of fun and suspense. Unfortunately, 'Monster Island' completely failed to be fun, even on a guilty pleasure level, and the stupidity became intelligence-insulting and exhausting after a while. The suspense was also absent and the whole film felt dreary. The monster action is limited, or at least what the underused creatures are given to do. What there was leaves one confused, bored and shouting at the screen in frustration and the creatures have little personality let alone menace or soul.\n\nGot the sense that the director Mark Atkins had little plan of how to direct or structure 'Monster Island' or what to do with it or that his heart was barely in it. The characters were neither interesting or worth rooting for, there is so little to them in personality or development, their nonsensical decision making is both frustrating and disreacting and how they're written has been seen before many times. The acting is poor at best, the biggest name being Eric Roberts who acts like a sleepwalking robot.\n\nConcluding, very bad. 2/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":582,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-06-01","keywords":"sea monster,helicopter,submarine,psychotronic film,underwater scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3779051289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000616/","name":"Eric Roberts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865084/","name":"Toshi Toda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345685/","name":"Adrian Bouchet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
