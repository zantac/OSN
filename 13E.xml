He works in Dublin at his dad's Hoover Repair Centre. One day as he's playing on the street a Czech woman who sells roses and cleans houses comes up and starts to talk to him. She's somewhat cool but she's also disarmingly honest. The dialogue seems understated, offhand, but the words seem to come from the heart. She plays the piano (and later reveals she's written some songs herself) and they get together to make music. Both are suffering from love affairs that went wrong. He longs for her but she keeps her distance. The simplicity of the acting makes the characters seem real, like everything else in the movie. It doesn't try too hard. It trusts its material, and it works.\n\nThe recording session they wangle with a group of other buskers (two guitarists and a youthful drummer) is a metaphor for this whole film. These people know nothing about recording, but they've got good material and the initially skeptical engineer winds up acknowledging that they've made a beautiful thing.\n\nOnce's transitions are a little awkward sometimes and its images aren't fancy, but the story moves you without having any sentimental payoffs. Kitchen sink film-making: it works if you believe in what you're doing. And have something to work with. The core of Once is the music. It's what they have to work with. The studio recording session has the good feel of things coming together: it's so strong and uncalculated-feeling, it makes the studio scene in Craig Brewer's Hustle and Flow look self-conscious. In Once the sound of the music speaks without special need for dialogue or close-ups. The real love story of Once is the love of musicians playing together. Few movies perhaps have captured any better that warmth and pleasure of making music with others.\n\nPeople have said this is a musical. If so, it redefines the musical as some American musicals have done recently, especially Spring Awakening and Passing Strange. What makes the idea fly is that it's as if the young man and the young woman can't express what they feel for each other, and the only way they can get their emotions across is to burst into song. But the songs are their songs, not some composer's.

The screenplay is by British writer Ian McEwan, adapting his own 2007 novella of the same name. The film stars multiple Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle - and was released one week after another literary adaptation, "The Seagull", in which the same two actors played young Russian lovers. This story follows two young Brits as they meet, fall in love and get married, focusing mainly on the wedding night.\n\nFlorence Pointing and Edward Mayhew have just been married and have arrived at a hotel at the titular beach for their honeymoon. Through an uncomfortable dinner in their room and awkward fumblings with their clothes, it becomes painfully clear that they are equally inexperienced and nervous regarding sex. As the evening slowly progresses, we see flashbacks of how their romance developed, with hints at what makes the prospect of sleeping together so uncomfortable for them - especially Florence. When things come to a head, the young marrieds have a seaside conservation which reveals much about who they are (and the era in which they live) and has very important consequences for the rest of their lives.\n\n"On Chesil Beach" is one of the most layered and most profound movies you are likely to see in 2018. Woven in with the development of the romance, the developments on the wedding night and the repercussions of all of it are themes of sexual repression, gender roles, class differences, pride, regret, communication, forgiveness and, of course, love and marriage. Some will say that not much happens in this film, but there is still a whole lot happenING. And through it all, the considerable acting chops of the two leads (bolstered by solid performances from multiple Oscar nominee Emily Watson, Anne-Marie Duff, Samuel West, Adrian Scarborough and Bebe Cave) make the characters exceedingly sympathetic and relevant. This is a very well-done film without much action, but with plenty to show all of us.

I found the range of topics going from: sex and disability, race and disability, the false message of inspirational story of a disabled person, deaf character stereotypes, blind character stereotypes, blindness as a superpower, and the so-called "happy ending" or resolution to a story of a character with a disability. The so-called "happy ending" can go in two or three ways: the disabled person has to be killed or cut off from life to restore order, the disabled person is institutionalized as a way to protect themselves from the outside world, or the disabled person is cured and does not need any form of special needs or guidance in the world. It is an insightful and in-depth documentary that makes you want to re-think about how Hollywood and movie's portrayal of disabled characters in movies can not only be misleading, but also dangerous to the disabled community in general. Hollywood must not rely on the same old stories of relying on disabled people as inspirational or cliched-stereotypes of characters who are villainous or victimized or pitied. But, one day that there will be a film with actual disabled people that are not inspirational, but living their daily lives in a humorous or ironic way that makes fun of the formula. That would be my ideal film to see when it gets made and put into a screening or a theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2020-04-01","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi853852185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0MWU3OWItNzRiYi00ZDNhLWE2NGUtNGU2ZjM4MDJmMGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0MWU3OWItNzRiYi00ZDNhLWE2NGUtNGU2ZjM4MDJmMGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Original accessible trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4526433/","name":"Lawrence Carter-Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11657129/","name":"Candace Coleman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11657130/","name":"Mike Ervin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3435265/","name":"Salome Chasnoff"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10730500/","name":"Susan Nussbaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10730499/","name":"Alyson Patsavas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10730498/","name":"Carrie Sandahl"}],"duration":"PT1H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I found the range of topics going from: sex and disability, race and disability, the false message of inspirational story of a disabled person, deaf character stereotypes, blind character stereotypes, blindness as a superpower, and the so-called "happy ending" or resolution to a story of a character with a disability. The so-called "happy ending" can go in two or three ways: the disabled person has to be killed or cut off from life to restore order, the disabled person is institutionalized as a way to protect themselves from the outside world, or the disabled person is cured and does not need any form of special needs or guidance in the world. It is an insightful and in-depth documentary that makes you want to re-think about how Hollywood and movie's portrayal of disabled characters in movies can not only be misleading, but also dangerous to the disabled community in general. Hollywood must not rely on the same old stories of relying on disabled people as inspirational or cliched-stereotypes of characters who are villainous or victimized or pitied. But, one day that there will be a film with actual disabled people that are not inspirational, but living their daily lives in a humorous or ironic way that makes fun of the formula. That would be my ideal film to see when it gets made and put into a screening or a theater.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2020-04-01","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi853852185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0MWU3OWItNzRiYi00ZDNhLWE2NGUtNGU2ZjM4MDJmMGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0MWU3OWItNzRiYi00ZDNhLWE2NGUtNGU2ZjM4MDJmMGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Original accessible trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4526433/","name":"Lawrence Carter-Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11657129/","name":"Candace Coleman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11657130/","name":"Mike Ervin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3435265/","name":"Salome Chasnoff"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10730500/","name":"Susan Nussbaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10730499/","name":"Alyson Patsavas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10730498/","name":"Carrie Sandahl"],"duration":"PT1H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story is an excellent mix of Sherlock Holmes-type crime thriller and religious criticism/commentary. I found this to be exceptional as the book was labeled as impossible to remake as a film and while the book is indeed better than the film, the film is certainly not without its charms.\n\nFirst of all the cast is pretty much perfect. Reading the book Sean Connery wasn't who I had in mind as the character but he certainly makes the character his own. His performance is for lack of a better word unique. He brings his usual indescribable something to the character which makes him almost instantly likable and believable. He delivers his lines in a confident manner that suits the character. Like in many other of his films his character is a teacher character but he does not seem to berate his pupil (Christian Slater) but allows him to grow on his own merely nudging him along. Even though not my first choice to have played the character I cannot find any other who would suit the part after seeing the film. Christian Slater plays the protagonist in what must be described as his break through character. His inexperience as an actor shows and once again suits the character who is also quite inexperienced in many ways. He portrays the change and ultimate conflicts of his character well enough and like Connery makes the character his own. Michael Lonsdale is pretty good as well and even though the character is not as well defined as in the book he provides the broad strokes in a satisfactory manner. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. does an excellent job in bringing Jorge to life and matches Connery's authority in their scenes together but once again the character is done in pretty broad strokes and you only get a small taste of what the character was like in the book. F. Murray Abraham's character is not like in the book and even though I was slightly disappointed by the film's portrayal of the character I understand why it was necessary to change the character for dramatic purposes. Ron Perlman who has since gone on to become quite a big star has a small role in this film and he does a decent job.\n\nThe film thrives on its complex story (which is nowhere near as complex as in the book) and deep characterization of the main characters who are about as defined as characters can become without internal monologue. There is voice-over by the older version of Christian Slater's character but is basically only used in the introduction and end part of the film and at a few crucial moments. The fantastic characterization is also helped by the incredibly sharp and well written dialog which never gets boring or forced like you could have feared given the religious content. In many scenes the dialog was in fact so good that I got the chills. The film focuses mainly on the mystery elements but the religious elements of the film are somehow weaved into the overall plot but there were plenty more of these religious elements and factors in the book. Overall I think the film should have been at least 15 minutes longer to get more of these elements in but maybe thats just me. However, all the most important plot points (and a few sub-plots) are covered so in that sense the film is successful.\n\nAnother thing that works very well is the atmosphere of the film which is very tense and mysterious. The tension is helped by the music which like so many other things in the film is quite unique and fitting. The set work is pretty simple but as it is a monastery you cannot expect the most flamboyant of sets. The sets work in their simplicity, however, and there is really no point of critique to be found in the set work. The lighting is kept at a minimum as well and once again this works in favor of the film as it adds to the overall tension. Sometimes the lighting is a little to dark but it happens so rarely that its not really a problem.\n\nAll in all Der Name der Rose (or The Name of the Rose) is a wonderful film but what drags the film down ever so slightly is that it can some times feel a little rushed because of the amount of material it is covering and there were a few elements from the book I would have liked to have seen in the film. In general, however, the cross from book to film is very well done and the overall plot is very well depicted with many tense, frightening and interesting moments. The film is definitely one of Connery's best and it is mainly because of his performance that I am giving the film a 9 in stead of an 8\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1986-10-17","keywords":"middle ages,abbey,monk,franciscan,14th century","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000225/","name":"Christian Slater"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702818/","name":"Helmut Qualtinger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013358/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0248767/","name":"Umberto Eco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001949/","name":"Andrew Birkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102722/","name":"Gérard Brach"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story is an excellent mix of Sherlock Holmes-type crime thriller and religious criticism/commentary. I found this to be exceptional as the book was labeled as impossible to remake as a film and while the book is indeed better than the film, the film is certainly not without its charms.\n\nFirst of all the cast is pretty much perfect. Reading the book Sean Connery wasn't who I had in mind as the character but he certainly makes the character his own. His performance is for lack of a better word unique. He brings his usual indescribable something to the character which makes him almost instantly likable and believable. He delivers his lines in a confident manner that suits the character. Like in many other of his films his character is a teacher character but he does not seem to berate his pupil (Christian Slater) but allows him to grow on his own merely nudging him along. Even though not my first choice to have played the character I cannot find any other who would suit the part after seeing the film. Christian Slater plays the protagonist in what must be described as his break through character. His inexperience as an actor shows and once again suits the character who is also quite inexperienced in many ways. He portrays the change and ultimate conflicts of his character well enough and like Connery makes the character his own. Michael Lonsdale is pretty good as well and even though the character is not as well defined as in the book he provides the broad strokes in a satisfactory manner. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. does an excellent job in bringing Jorge to life and matches Connery's authority in their scenes together but once again the character is done in pretty broad strokes and you only get a small taste of what the character was like in the book.

No I don`t mean the movie I mean the fact that in this American TVM the bad guy is a foreigner and he`s not British . Wow what a stroke of genius that is , the genuis . Unfortunately that`s the only radical thing about CABIN PRESSURE . Despite not being British the villain is one major cliche , a computer geek who wears a red polo neck sweater , green cords , greasy hair and spectacles , and who`s a socially inept loner whose only friend is a spider . This goes beyond cliche and becomes close to offensive . Within 20 minutes you`re wishing the computer geek is from Britain and is played by Gary Oldman or Sean Bean .\n\nAnd even if the producers had the money for a big name Brit actor there`s no way a star name would want to sully their reputation by appearing in this rubbish . And make no mistake this is rubbish . The bad guy is unconvincing as is the hero who`s a former alcoholic . I guess being a bland cypher he need an identifiable character flaw but that doesn`t disguise the fact that he`s just there to spout lines and save the day . But the lack of characterisation is the least of the problems with the script , let`s look at the whole concept of a computer controlled plane :isn`t there something totally ridiculous with the whole concept ? I mean I`m sure that in real life someone has thought up the whole idea and dismissed it precisely on the grounds of someone hacking into the controls . Oh look out for a very contrived plot twist where someone turns up at the hospital after being bitten by a funnel web spider , which also leads to a plot hole by the hero not asking about an Austin Powers lookalike\n\nSo what would I have done with the script ? It`s very simple , one of the characters on the plane is Senator Caulfield who is on the plane with his son and daughter in law . The daughter in law is called Brandee and she is a very fit blonde and the whole film would have worked if it was set around the premise of the computer geek being a bit of a perv and demanding the senator have sex with Brandee or else he will crash the plane . This would lead to cinema goers all over the world to discuss INDECENT PROPOSAL type questions like " If some pervy geek had hacked into a plan`s control system would you have depraved sex with your father in law if your life depended upon it ?

No I don`t mean the movie I mean the fact that in this American TVM the bad guy is a foreigner and he`s not British . Wow what a stroke of genius that is , the genuis . Unfortunately that`s the only radical thing about CABIN PRESSURE . Despite not being British the villain is one major cliche , a computer geek who wears a red polo neck sweater , green cords , greasy hair and spectacles , and who`s a socially inept loner whose only friend is a spider . This goes beyond cliche and becomes close to offensive . Within 20 minutes you`re wishing the computer geek is from Britain and is played by Gary Oldman or Sean Bean .\n\nAnd even if the producers had the money for a big name Brit actor there`s no way a star name would want to sully their reputation by appearing in this rubbish . And make no mistake this is rubbish . The bad guy is unconvincing as is the hero who`s a former alcoholic . I guess being a bland cypher he need an identifiable character flaw but that doesn`t disguise the fact that he`s just there to spout lines and save the day . But the lack of characterisation is the least of the problems with the script , let`s look at the whole concept of a computer controlled plane :isn`t there something totally ridiculous with the whole concept ? I mean I`m sure that in real life someone has thought up the whole idea and dismissed it precisely on the grounds of someone hacking into the controls . Oh look out for a very contrived plot twist where someone turns up at the hospital after being bitten by a funnel web spider , which also leads to a plot hole by the hero not asking about an Austin Powers lookalike\n\nSo what would I have done with the script ? It`s very simple , one of the characters on the plane is Senator Caulfield who is on the plane with his son and daughter in law . The daughter in law is called Brandee and she is a very fit blonde and the whole film would have worked if it was set around the premise of the computer geek being a bit of a perv and demanding the senator have sex with Brandee or else he will crash the plane . This would lead to cinema goers all over the world to discuss INDECENT PROPOSAL type questions like " If some pervy geek had hacked into a plan`s control system would you have depraved sex with your father in law if your life depended upon it ?

For the most part it succeeds.  Not for this movie the ridiculously oiled pectorals of part II, where Rambo is transformed into a grunting, soul-less killing machine.  He actually begins the movie as a fairly nice chap, someone we can sympathise with, and it's his unnecessarily rough treatment at the hands of small-town sheriff Dennehey and his crew that is likely to shift audience sympathies firmly in the direction of the 'misunderstood' Vietnam vet.\n\n   Here, Rambo is also a character who is reluctant to kill unless he absolutely has to.  A far cry from the eventual homicidal maniac he was to become, who is seemingly responsible for more death than World Wars 1 &amp; 2 combined.  So, to those expecting bucketloads of gore and senseless killing, you'd probably be better off watching the news.  "First Blood" is actually more akin to those 'survival in the wilderness' programs you might see on the Discovery Channel; with Rambo having to rely more on guile and cunning than brawn and an M-16 to get him out of tricky situations.\n\n   That's not to imply that this is boring.  Far from it.  Director Kotcheff shows a keen awareness of pace, it's never by any means certain that Rambo will survive (if you discount the other films, of course!) and the supporting characters are all wonderfully unsympathetic.  Even Trautmann, Rambo's supposed mentor, has a touch of the villain about him for being complicit in the ultimate dehumanisation of Rambo during the war.  By far the best character here is played by Dennehey; always watchable, but Stallone too is good; nicely restrained, more "Cop Land" than "Cobra"\n\n    Not an action film as such, it sits better as suspense. In that sense, it does exactly what it says on the tin; rendering John Rambo a far more interesting character here than his incarnation in the other two films. That is basically just wet-dream material for inadequate, spotty faced adolescent boys everywhere.  This Rambo is recognisably human.  Having said that, neither should you view expecting a solemn Vietnam protest movie in the vein of "Platoon" or "The Deer Hunter".  It's different in tone and style to the both of those movies, but in my view at least, is better than either of them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":238268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1982-10-22","keywords":"abuse of power,vietnam war veteran,corrupt sheriff,veteran,corrupt cop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rambo: First Blood","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1402863897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkY2FhOTgtODAzZi00YzUyLTk5ZWMtODZiNTM0YWI2MDhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkY2FhOTgtODAzZi00YzUyLTk5ZWMtODZiNTM0YWI2MDhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001133/","name":"Brian Dennehy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001077/","name":"Richard Crenna"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0467646/","name":"Ted Kotcheff"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055376/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0779514/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0231747/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0606251/","name":"David Morrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0468997/","name":"Michael Kozoll"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755266/","name":"William Sackheim"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For the most part it succeeds.  Not for this movie the ridiculously oiled pectorals of part II, where Rambo is transformed into a grunting, soul-less killing machine.  He actually begins the movie as a fairly nice chap, someone we can sympathise with, and it's his unnecessarily rough treatment at the hands of small-town sheriff Dennehey and his crew that is likely to shift audience sympathies firmly in the direction of the 'misunderstood' Vietnam vet.\n\n   Here, Rambo is also a character who is reluctant to kill unless he absolutely has to.  A far cry from the eventual homicidal maniac he was to become, who is seemingly responsible for more death than World Wars 1 &amp; 2 combined.  So, to those expecting bucketloads of gore and senseless killing, you'd probably be better off watching the news.  "First Blood" is actually more akin to those 'survival in the wilderness' programs you might see on the Discovery Channel; with Rambo having to rely more on guile and cunning than brawn and an M-16 to get him out of tricky situations.\n\n   That's not to imply that this is boring.  Far from it.  Director Kotcheff shows a keen awareness of pace, it's never by any means certain that Rambo will survive (if you discount the other films, of course!) and the supporting characters are all wonderfully unsympathetic.  Even Trautmann, Rambo's supposed mentor, has a touch of the villain about him for being complicit in the ultimate dehumanisation of Rambo during the war.  By far the best character here is played by Dennehey; always watchable, but Stallone too is good; nicely restrained, more "Cop Land" than "Cobra"\n\n    Not an action film as such, it sits better as suspense. In that sense, it does exactly what it says on the tin; rendering John Rambo a far more interesting character here than his incarnation in the other two films. That is basically just wet-dream material for inadequate, spotty faced adolescent boys everywhere.  This Rambo is recognisably human.  Having said that, neither should you view expecting a solemn Vietnam protest movie in the vein of "Platoon" or "The Deer Hunter".  It's different in tone and style to the both of those movies, but in my view at least, is better than either of them.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":238268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1982-10-22","keywords":"abuse of power,vietnam war veteran,corrupt sheriff,veteran,corrupt cop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rambo: First Blood","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1402863897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkY2FhOTgtODAzZi00YzUyLTk5ZWMtODZiNTM0YWI2MDhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkY2FhOTgtODAzZi00YzUyLTk5ZWMtODZiNTM0YWI2MDhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001133/","name":"Brian Dennehy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001077/","name":"Richard Crenna"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0467646/","name":"Ted Kotcheff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055376/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0779514/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0231747/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0606251/","name":"David Morrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0468997/","name":"Michael Kozoll","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755266/","name":"William Sackheim"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's refreshing to see science-fact made understandable and yes, entertaining (the tangerine/battery visual was funny). But the film goes beyond simply laying out facts and ideas to tell the story. It puts together a group of characters that have real issues in dealing with the problem, and with each other. There is a father/son relationship (Charles Shaunessy and Clive Revill) that is touching and real, funny and even corny at times.

My 5 year old nephew could take him down let alone our main character.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32718,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-11-04","keywords":"boyfriend girlfriend relationship,counterfeiting,reference to billy joel,reference to merlin,reference to king arthur","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fighting: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1304560409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1OTkyMDg5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc4MjUyMg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1OTkyMDg5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc4MjUyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, a young counterfeiter (Tatum) is introduced to the world of underground street fighting by a seasoned scam artist (Howard), who becomes his manager on the bare-knuckling brawling circuit.

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

Firstly, I really enjoyed John Michael McDonagh's Calvary with Brendan Gleeson, both written and directed by McDonagh, just like this film. Secondly, Michael Peña being one of my favourite actors since the film Crash and have liked him in everything since. Thirdly, this year's Tarzan, Alexander Skarsgård, having enjoyed his John Clayton/Tarzan I was eager to see what else he can offer. \n\nPeña and Skargård play Bob and Terry, two corrupt cops who wreck havoc across New Mexico taking and doing whatever they want under the protection of their badge and guns, roughing up criminals in their unorthodox policing methods, who are unfortunately enough to get in their way. Skargård's Terry being the hulking, unhinged, drunkard that swaggers about punching most people in the face; a lot, and Peña's Bob is the intellect of the two, smart-talking and quick-thinking being his forte, throwing out quirky philosophical comments at any given moment. The chemistry between the two is highly entertaining, provoking you to want to know what they're going to do next. \n\nThe two of them rampage about town in Terry's indestructible 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and no one is safe, apart from the meek, so justice is on the agenda, just not the kind of justice the precinct would warrant, especially their Lieutenant, played by Paul Reiser. Their shake downs of crims eventually leads them to smug, rich Brit, crime-Lord James Mangan, who is just wrong, very wrong indeed but played well by Divergent's Theo James, donning his home accent and wonderful tweed attire. \n\nThe film goes all over the place, (even to Iceland) and although not hard to follow, it feels like a mess, thinking I had missed something along the way. A lot happens in the 98min runtime but I can't say it's fast pace, it felt unbalanced quite a few times during the movie but the events that do unfold are dark and brutal if not amusing. \n\nThere's quite an assortment of characters besides the key players, notably the absconding informant, Reggie, the squirmy, feminine Birdwell, Paddy Power, Pádraic and the stunning Jackie Hollis, played by Creed's Tessa Thompson. With all the colourful characters it made the story feel like a disjointed, poor version of a Tarantino movie but and lacked a great soundtrack, apart from the Glen Campbell that seems to be playing most of the time during the film. \n\nIt's a rough, tough buddy-cop movie like no other, could well have been written by Elmore Leonard whilst on LSD. It's very much a McDonagh's movie, being quite refreshing in effortless style, only Americanised and yet, there's great potential to improve on this film. \n\nRunning Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 7 Story: 5 Script: 8 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for being quite outrageous and offensive in parts. \n\n66% 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17809,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2016-10-07","keywords":"hare krishna,dirty cop,corrupt police,albuquerque new mexico,police detective","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1613936153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNzU2OTQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE4NDE5MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNzU2OTQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE4NDE5MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two corrupt cops in New Mexico set out to blackmail and frame every criminal unfortunate enough to cross their path.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun! This is entertainment, after all. My rating: 7 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-23","keywords":"character name as series title,surname as series title,one word series title,2010s,reboot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1395771/","name":"Lucas Till","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1159702/","name":"Tristin Mays","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2058713/","name":"Justin Hires"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0504531/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0957453/","name":"Lee David Zlotoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006997/","name":"Peter M.

One of Van Damme's worst movies without a doubt","reviewBody":"As such an admirer of Jean-Claude Van Damme, watching him make stuff like this is really disheartening to be honest with you all. I grew up with his movies, and whilst not all of them were great, he has provided me with many hours of entertainment with classics such as Bloodsport, Universal Soldier, and Time Cop. Even recently he has really upped his game with some DTV gems like Until Death, Wake Of Death, Replicant, Assassination Games, and In Hell. But this feels like something that Steven Seagal rejected. It doesn't have much action to speak of, and when it does happen, we get a lot of frustrating shaky camera work that really hampers what little it has going for it. It doesn't help that I can't stand politics. Anything to do with it, I tend to lose interest in quickly. There are a few exceptions to this rule where I end up enjoying them, but this was bloody terrible. Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't really trying all that much here. He phones it in, but he can't overcome the weak script or poor pacing issues. I realize he has toned down his histrionics over the last few years, but this movie really lets him down. The rest of the cast do what they have to do, but none of them really stand out all that much\n\nFinal Thoughts: He's made some really good DTV gems since this awful film, but this is without a doubt one of the worst movies he has ever done. It's up there with Double Team, Black Eagle, and Derailed. Even die hard JCVD fans (I consider myself one of them!) will be disappointed by this. The lack of interest really sinks this one\n\n3/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6461,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller","War"],"datePublished":"2006-05-23","keywords":"low budget,embassy,martial arts,exploding truck,exploding car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Second in Command","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1686503705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3NGI4MTEtMTc1My00ZTYwLWFjOWItNTg4NTAxMzcwYjQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3NGI4MTEtMTc1My00ZTYwLWFjOWItNTg4NTAxMzcwYjQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185107/","name":"Julie Cox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571326/","name":"Alan McKenna"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1415540/","name":"Simon Fellows"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071430/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020879/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097598/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2230737/","name":"Jonathan Bowers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179968/","name":"David L.

One of Van Damme's worst movies without a doubt","reviewBody":"As such an admirer of Jean-Claude Van Damme, watching him make stuff like this is really disheartening to be honest with you all. I grew up with his movies, and whilst not all of them were great, he has provided me with many hours of entertainment with classics such as Bloodsport, Universal Soldier, and Time Cop. Even recently he has really upped his game with some DTV gems like Until Death, Wake Of Death, Replicant, Assassination Games, and In Hell. But this feels like something that Steven Seagal rejected. It doesn't have much action to speak of, and when it does happen, we get a lot of frustrating shaky camera work that really hampers what little it has going for it. It doesn't help that I can't stand politics. Anything to do with it, I tend to lose interest in quickly. There are a few exceptions to this rule where I end up enjoying them, but this was bloody terrible. Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't really trying all that much here. He phones it in, but he can't overcome the weak script or poor pacing issues. I realize he has toned down his histrionics over the last few years, but this movie really lets him down. The rest of the cast do what they have to do, but none of them really stand out all that much\n\nFinal Thoughts: He's made some really good DTV gems since this awful film, but this is without a doubt one of the worst movies he has ever done. It's up there with Double Team, Black Eagle, and Derailed. Even die hard JCVD fans (I consider myself one of them!) will be disappointed by this. The lack of interest really sinks this one\n\n3/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6461,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller","War"],"datePublished":"2006-05-23","keywords":"low budget,embassy,martial arts,exploding truck,exploding car","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Second in Command","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1686503705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3NGI4MTEtMTc1My00ZTYwLWFjOWItNTg4NTAxMzcwYjQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3NGI4MTEtMTc1My00ZTYwLWFjOWItNTg4NTAxMzcwYjQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185107/","name":"Julie Cox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571326/","name":"Alan McKenna"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1415540/","name":"Simon Fellows"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071430/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020879/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097598/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2230737/","name":"Jonathan Bowers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179968/","name":"David L.

Now I've seen only a few episodes of the original and, although there are a few differences, the character itself hasn't changed much. It's like Smallville rather than Superman, a much younger version of the same character.\n\nRDA's MacGyver was quiet and modest and mild-manner, but so is this one. He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome. This version does use more chemicals, but then there are more chemicals around us nowadays.\n\nSo, for all those comparing this version with the old, just relax and give in to the fun!

And when I say thoughtful I mean that it wouldn't have taken too much thinking to come up with something almost exactly the same but something that was plausible. It's not enough to ruin the entire movie experience but it's enough to keep it from becoming a pretty good movie worth 1-2 stars higher since the end of the movie most would agree Is kinda important.

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This original and gore-soaked vampires film begins centuries ago. Unknown to humanity, centuries old blood feud raged between aristocrat vampires and subdued legion of werewolves known as Lycans who work as slaves. For centuries Sonja ( Rhona Mitra ) is a loyal soldier of the vampire clan, but she falls in love with the Lycan Lucian ( Michael Sheen ). The tale traces the origins of the confrontation between a ruling class of bloodsuckers and their onetime slaves, the werewolves . A young Lycan named Lucian emerges as a powerful rebel who rallies the rebellious werewolves to rise up against Viktor, Sonja's father and the brutal vampire king . Lucian is joined by his secret lover, Sonja, in his struggle against the Vampire army and his fight for Lycan freedom . Neverheless , the war was not as it had seemed. In one night, the lies that had united the kind vampire had been exposed. Sonja has formed a secret alliance with Lucian, ruler of the werewolf clan to overthrow Viktor ( Bill Nighy ), vampires leader who has enslaved them . But Viktor's lust for power and domination has failed. As Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe . Soon the hunt would be on for his killer . As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.\n\nThis amazing movie displays noisy action , thrills ride, stirring fighting , graphic violence , brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty amusing . It packs large loads of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with arcs . Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck and the breathtaking fighting scenes are realized with magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department . The film blends horror, suspense, struggles, rip-roaring action, terror and lots of gore. Set design is of first class , settings are stylized, Gothic scenarios , and spooky and ghoulish atmosphere. Specials effects are breathtaking, part of them are made by means of computer generator and part by make up . Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Paul Haslinger and colorful and dark cinematography by Ross Emery. Spectacular and moving direction by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of Underworld I and II and known blockbusters, such as ¨10.000 BC, Indepencence day, I robot, Resident evil, Pith black ¨, among them . The interesting screenplay is written by Len Wiseman, who directed the former entries , along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux . All actors and technicians participated in the previous outings with exception Kate Beckinsale , being well replaced by Rhona Mitra as relentless action woman . Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155509,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-02-04","keywords":"vampire,slave,werewolf,prequel,sword fight","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3494969369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MzgwNzAxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEzNTEwMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MzgwNzAxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEzNTEwMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An origins story centered on the centuries-old feud between the the race of aristocratic vampires known as Death Dealers, and their onetime slaves, the Lycans."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593961/","name":"Rhona Mitra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790688/","name":"Michael Sheen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851281/","name":"Patrick Tatopoulos"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564286/","name":"Danny McBride"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085736/","name":"Dirk Blackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564586/","name":"Howard McCain"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Excellent character driven narrative around families, relationships, parenting, financial and racial divides, corruption, climate change, climate refugees, PTSD and traumas from just being alive as its all going down. One might think the writers had a crystal ball - it's pretty spot on and so well timed given that our entire continent is burning and that climate change is no longer some abstract futuristic theory, but something we are now living through, even in our cities. An enjoyable watch, some might find boring, possibly all the people that have reviewed this show thinking it's Lisa Macwhatsherface in the lead role (spoiler: it's not, and yes that British accent is real) - but this show really delivers in the last few episodes in season one. It's in your face about many subjects we like to shun - if you are after a non thought provoking, non challenging easy view, go watch something else, this is not for you. Touching a lot on the effects the changing climate has on young people and their narratives and responses around that, I found this helpful as a parent.

Though this isn't about bushfires specifically, this is a post climate change driven saga that is pretty realistic - in a pretty scary way. Excellent character driven narrative around families, relationships, parenting, financial and racial divides, corruption, climate change, climate refugees, PTSD and traumas from just being alive as its all going down. One might think the writers had a crystal ball - it's pretty spot on and so well timed given that our entire continent is burning and that climate change is no longer some abstract futuristic theory, but something we are now living through, even in our cities. An enjoyable watch, some might find boring, possibly all the people that have reviewed this show thinking it's Lisa Macwhatsherface in the lead role (spoiler: it's not, and yes that British accent is real) - but this show really delivers in the last few episodes in season one. It's in your face about many subjects we like to shun - if you are after a non thought provoking, non challenging easy view, go watch something else, this is not for you. Touching a lot on the effects the changing climate has on young people and their narratives and responses around that, I found this helpful as a parent. Great all round production, futuristic but realistic visual, A1 cast portraying depth-full honest and challenging characters. If you liked Aussie drama Love my way, you will like this.

It's a tidy, well made film that draws you into a family battling the mental illness of the mother, who believes she is a sentient android who has malfunctioned. But maybe she is a human who has constructed an elaborate backstory to hide from the pain of being a person who cannot love and who cannot stop beating her on-the-cusp of manhood son. The material clues suggest we are in our time, not some future echoing the television series "Humans," but we are looking at the world through the eyes of the narrator, the mother, and she sees clues about her android origin everywhere. By the time the movie reaches its conclusion, you've been drawn into the madness, the uncertainty of what is human, what is programming, and profound discomfort for the mom and her interior life. The dedication at the end of the film makes it clear the filmmaker wanted to share his experience with his mother and her struggle. He succeeded. The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters. The actors all do a fine job, particularly Marta Krol in the role of the mother and Marieta Zukowska as her peer, counterpart, alter ego or therapist -- when you are in psychosis, those around you play many roles.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067989/","name":"Marta Król"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2029225/","name":"Marcin Sztabinski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2346424/","name":"Marieta Zukowska"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0734708/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0767135/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0778711/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"}],"duration":"PT1H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Jestem REN: Directed by Patricia Ryczko. With Marta Król, Marcin Sztabinski, Marieta Zukowska, Janusz Chabior. We meet a mother quietly obsessing over the sudden change in her family's life. Gradually we learn she is an android, and has suffered a glitch.

It's a tidy, well made film that draws you into a family battling the mental illness of the mother, who believes she is a sentient android who has malfunctioned. But maybe she is a human who has constructed an elaborate backstory to hide from the pain of being a person who cannot love and who cannot stop beating her on-the-cusp of manhood son. The material clues suggest we are in our time, not some future echoing the television series "Humans," but we are looking at the world through the eyes of the narrator, the mother, and she sees clues about her android origin everywhere. By the time the movie reaches its conclusion, you've been drawn into the madness, the uncertainty of what is human, what is programming, and profound discomfort for the mom and her interior life. The dedication at the end of the film makes it clear the filmmaker wanted to share his experience with his mother and her struggle. He succeeded. The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters. The actors all do a fine job, particularly Marta Krol in the role of the mother and Marieta Zukowska as her peer, counterpart, alter ego or therapist -- when you are in psychosis, those around you play many roles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067989/","name":"Marta Król","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2029225/","name":"Marcin Sztabinski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2346424/","name":"Marieta Zukowska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0734708/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0767135/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0778711/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It stands out in a world full of childish sequels, prequels and bland and boring movies. Finally, a film for adults with action, intrigue, psychological warfare and sex.  I am glad they still make films like this.\n\nSecondly, and this is the good news part or rather second piece of good news, all the Russian hackers and bots whose life is comprised of not doing constructive are not very good. We have proof here. They have flooded this site and others according this film bad reviews, but given their command of 'English' we can spot them so easily and breathe a sigh of relief that they are so obvious. Clearly, Russian motherland defenders (who do nothing to improve their decrepit country all day and instead sit behind their computers 24/7) are pathetic.\n\nHere are examples just from the top page of reviews here:\n\n"Red rate for red movie"\n\n"This is so money waste to watch this."\n\nA reviewer called 'english'_artist writes: "Porn movie or 'spie' movie?"\n\nor how about this: "blatant propaganda in 2018 DansGame "\n\nDear Russians, put down the vodka bottle, turn off the laptop, step outside and pave a road or repair a bridge. They are all crumbling. \n\nEveryone else, this is an action-packed film in a sea of weekly Marvel films or boring sequels. Watch it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175867,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-03-02","keywords":"seduction,spy,female nudity,secret agent,sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4237277209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MjczYjgtZjFjYy00NGVhLTk1NTItZWM5MTgxMGY2YjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MjczYjgtZjFjYy00NGVhLTk1NTItZWM5MTgxMGY2YjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ballerina Dominika Egorova is recruited to 'Sparrow School' a Russian intelligence service where she is forced to use her body as a weapon.

Jego twórcy chcą pokazać, w jaki sposób branże spożywcza, farmaceutyczna i medyczna oszukują klientów, proponując produkty i usługi, które zamiast pomóc im schudnąć, uszczuplają jedynie ich portfele. Widzowie dowiedzą się, jak myśleć o jedzeniu w nowy sposób i zobaczą, jak najlepiej się odchudzać, by proces ten był skuteczny i długotrwały.</desc>

It mixes hard science with abject fantasy to make moral and philosophical points about the human condition and our place in the universe without the usual clichés. And it does so with good dialog, strong characterization, and intensely emotional acting. Harris and Mastrantonio are absolutely electric together and dominate the screen, but the entire cast deserves plenty of credit. The production itself is mesmerizing despite its vast scale and tastefully used special effects. The film is long, but worth every second of the experience, and the slightly lengthier, more detailed Special Edition version is even better than the original.\n\nOstensibly, this is a film about first contact with non-terrestrial intelligence. But the story allegorically deals with an amazing array of themes common to great dramas - violence, love, capitalism, war, courage and cowardice. The hardest, most obedient soldier in the film, played spectacularly by Michael Biehn, is a coward, and a man who is hopelessly in love with his estranged wife (Harris) turns that love into an act of suicidal heroism which might unintentionally save the world. And yet nothing is exactly as it seems to be, and there are really no spoilers in this review. There are so many subtle and sensitively developed themes in this film that it is hard to imagine a more epically human drama in the sci-fi genre. Even so, this is a film which entertains at every level, and will satisfy the action fan as much as the wannabe film critic. ;-) \n\nMost of the film takes place on an experimental submarine drilling platform owned by a petroleum company. A nuclear sub has been lost in "the abyss" - a subduction trench near the Caiman Islands - after encountering an impossibly fast object. Soon, the US military commandeers the platform and its command ship - The Benthic Explorer - to attempt a rescue mission. As everything begins to go wrong, and the encounters with strange phenomena continue, the Navy SEAL in charge of the rescue attempt begins to crack. Meanwhile, on the surface, accusations concerning the sub are escalating between the USSR and USA, and nuclear war seems immanent.

This is driving the long-term couple to the point of infidelity: a fact the ever-focused Fiona - whose life, to her, probably feels to be in a perfect if selfish equilibrium - is oblivious to. With Fiona's intense but comfortable world about to cave in around her, her increasing stress is not helped by the latest case she is working on: one where Adam ( Fionn Whitehead from "Dunkirk"), a Jehovah's Witness boy and a minor, is refusing on religious grounds the blood transfusion he desperately needs to fight his lukaemia. Fiona's decisions in the months ahead go much further than a simple judgement on the case.\n\nTwo acting giants - one born in London; one born in New York - tower over this Ian McEwan adaptation like leviathons. I bandy around the phrase "national treasure" a lot in my reviews, but here Emma Thompson is simply breathtakingly powerful in the lead role of Judge Fiona Maye, exhibiting such extremes of emotion that you would like to think that an Oscar nomination would be assured. (However, before I run out and put a £10 bet on her to win, the film is such a small British film that unfortunately both a nomination and a win seem unlikely! THIS IS A CRIME! Please share and lobby people, lobby! Perhaps at the very least we can hope for some BAFTA recognition). \n\nSometimes a masterly lead performance can make a co-star performance seem unbalanced, but no such danger here. Stanley Tucci makes a perfect acting foil for Thompson: if he were a wine he would be described as "exasperation, frustration, compassion with strong notes of respect". And he carries it off with perfection.\n\nThis is an incredibly intelligent film, working on so many different levels and subject to so much interpretation. Fiona's feelings for the troubled teenager feel more maternal than sexual, but when those feelings become returned and escalate the whole piece develops a queasily oedipal quality. Many films have focused on illicit attractions between teacher and pupil, but here lies a new variation, with Maye fighting against her best professional insticts to 'do the right thing'. "I'm frightened of myself" she eventually wails to a colleague. \n\nIn his opening hospital scenes, (not withstanding the comic similarities between the guitar scene here and a certain scene in "Airplane"!), Adam seems completely other-wordly compared to a typical teen and this comes across as utterly false. That is, until you consider the oddness of his family background and Jehovah's Witness upbringing. As such, the film just about gets away with it. Whitehead does a good job with a difficult role. \n\nIf you've been in a court, you'll know that there is something regal and magical about a judge in full regalia entering a packed courtroom. So it's unusual to see the view from the other side of the door... a non-descript office corridor and a non-descript door. Helping the judge on this side of the door is her PA Nigel, played by the brilliant Jason Watkins: a TV regular (e.g. "Line of Duty", "W1A") but seen far less at the movies. \n\nAs a story of obsessive fixation, it borders on McEwan's disturbing earlier work "Enduring Love". And it has the potential to go in lots of interesting directions as a sort of bonkers platonic love triangle ("He wants to live with US?" splutters Tucci). Where the story does end up going was not particularly to my liking, and a melodramatic concert scene was - for me - a little overdone. However it does give rise to a scene (the 'sopping wet' scene) that shows Thompson at her most brilliant: if she DID get Oscar or BAFTA nominated then this will be her pre-announcement snippet.\n\nIt's a great film for showcasing acting talent, but beware: it's short on laughs, not remotely uplifting and takes a while to mentally recover from!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-08-24","keywords":"female judge,husband wife relationship,teenage boy,teenager,17 year old","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677390105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzYmNjOGItNWY1ZC00ZmI5LWFhMGMtZTI0OGMwYTczNmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As her marriage to Jack (Stanley Tucci) flounders, eminent High Court judge Fiona Maye (Emma Thompson) has a life-changing decision to make at work - should she force a teenage boy, Adam (Fionn Whitehead), to have the blood transfusion that will save his life?

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

First off, I have never seen an Alexander Payne film, and the story itself sort of seemed like the type of film that would end up on a long list of solid films that end up being unmemorable. Much to my surprise, it has a sort of tone that you don't see often in these types of films.\n\nThis is a film that carefully treads around the edges. I wouldn't say it ever became too sentimental. Yet I also expected a snappy dialogue- filled, fast-paced dramedy, sort of like Reitman's Up in the Air, that other Clooney film. The film is written and plays out like a real life situation. One could maybe try to say that about any film like this, but here it rings true. To say it's slow or fast paced isn't really what matters, but what matters is how much it develops its characters with real richness and detail. In a way, the screenplay is helped a lot by Payne as a director, not because the writing is thin, but because the direction allows the film to feel sort of spontaneous. This isn't a film full of twists or turns, and yet at every corner when you try to analyze it, you realize how unpredictable it all feels. \n\nI have also heard one thing about it in many reviews, and that is how it's messy like life. One can easily read those descriptions and just roll his or her eyes, but that description really holds truth. The film doesn't feel to glamorous or stylized. It certainly isn't the dramedy with witty one liners that I expected. Instead, when it's all over, you take a step back and realize that it all feels sort of messy. It's not complicated, and in fact it's a pretty simple film, but even the editing helps this certain mood that the film leaves you in. It's simple, yet hard to really pinpoint and describe how it all comes together or how it's something of real importance. This is completely refreshing, especially when films these days hammer you with these sort of messages or details.\n\nI now want to talk about the performances, which are stellar. Clooney just won the Globe a couple of hours ago, and now I look at it and think to myself "wow... of all of his performances, this is getting him awards?". It's a very restrained performance, and no, it isn't a transformation. Some will once again say that Clooney is only "playing himself", but to me, when Clooney does great, he really nails it. He gives all of his performances something distinct about them, and this is perhaps his wild-card character. He doesn't add in his usual smoothness that we see a lot from him. This stands apart, and I am surprised for that reason for its success. Shailene Woodley is fantastic here as well, and really impressed me with the sort of indignation and maturity that she mixes together. She's better than most of the contenders for the Oscar in her category, more specifically Octavia Spencer, Melissa McCarthy, and Janet McTeer.\n\nI loved this film. I wasn't sure of it while I was seeing it, but after it's over, as hard as it is to really describe and know why I enjoyed it so much, I did.

"Fourmi " (=ant;the football wizard is too short to be signed to Arsenal )is the story of a redemption.Theo knows that ,if he does not qualify for the selection,his father's life is irreparably doomed ;so he's compelled to lie to his coach (André Dussolier) and his assistant (who seems to prefer pastry cook to football,so do I).\n\nOnly his good friend,Karim is in secret ;as for the youngsters ' performances ,it's uneven :it goes from good (Laurent,Karim) to mediocre (Max ,the computer wizzard :how could you believe this giddy jerk would be able to write an email using the perfect club jargon,? the young actor acts as if he does not care)\n\nThe subject of the movie is a man's redemption ;it renders the denouement null and void ,a crowd-pleaser ,the expected event ; the movie would have been a hundred times more convincing without it , and reductio ad aburdum that a lie can be vital to save a human life .And that a man can help himself ,and ,after a while does not need his son's prowesses to be a human being again ( the bedroom he paints for him speaks volumes about his metamorphosis).And Mr Damiens was up to scratch!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":298,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-04","keywords":"alcoholic,competition,boy,fraud,father son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3418340889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRhMGJmYTMtMGI4OC00Y2E2LWJiZDgtZTU5ZWVlMTc0NGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRhMGJmYTMtMGI4OC00Y2E2LWJiZDgtZTU5ZWVlMTc0NGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1460782/","name":"François Damiens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9521992/","name":"Maleaume Paquin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244707/","name":"André Dussollier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1272853/","name":"Julien Rappeneau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0663623/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10965776/","name":"Artur Laperla","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1272853/","name":"Julien Rappeneau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6504693/","name":"Mario Torrecillas"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A breeze of fresh air in the genre.","reviewBody":"Admittedly, I felt very skeptical learning about a new polish production. Especially in a well-trodden genre of "missing-relative vs ncompetent-police vs genius-relative". I was proven wrong, so, so wrong from the very start till the very end. Klangor is an absolute masterpiece, briliant, captivating plot, amazing acting crew with a cherry on top soundtrack, building a wild ride through beuatiful polish landscapes. Unlike many others, it completes the experience with a very satisfying, bittersweet, yet really cohesive series finale. Give it a shot, its more than worth it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"genre":["Crime"],"datePublished":"2021-03-26","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458971/","name":"Arkadiusz Jakubik","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652292/","name":"Maja Ostaszewska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1728821/","name":"Aleksandra Poplawska"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0506795/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Last, Fx's look cheap and acting amateurish, except from Shia. But...\n\nSo, overall a wasted opportunity to create a great movie. Shame on Director 's and writers.

But, despite mounting evidence, Piller, with the aid of his assistant (Krieps), becomes increasingly convinced of Han's innocence and finds himself in the unlikely position of fighting to save his life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001602/","name":"Guy Pearce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051903/","name":"Claes Bang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3043279/","name":"Vicky Krieps"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6679051/","name":"Dan Friedkin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0473978/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0241129/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650089/","name":"John Orloff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1318843/","name":"Mark Fergus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1319757/","name":"Hawk Ostby"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jego twórcy chcą pokazać, w jaki sposób branże spożywcza, farmaceutyczna i medyczna oszukują klientów, proponując produkty i usługi, które zamiast pomóc im schudnąć, uszczuplają jedynie ich portfele. Widzowie dowiedzą się, jak myśleć o jedzeniu w nowy sposób i zobaczą, jak najlepiej się odchudzać, by proces ten był skuteczny i długotrwały.</desc>

It mixes hard science with abject fantasy to make moral and philosophical points about the human condition and our place in the universe without the usual clichés. And it does so with good dialog, strong characterization, and intensely emotional acting. Harris and Mastrantonio are absolutely electric together and dominate the screen, but the entire cast deserves plenty of credit. The production itself is mesmerizing despite its vast scale and tastefully used special effects. The film is long, but worth every second of the experience, and the slightly lengthier, more detailed Special Edition version is even better than the original.\n\nOstensibly, this is a film about first contact with non-terrestrial intelligence. But the story allegorically deals with an amazing array of themes common to great dramas - violence, love, capitalism, war, courage and cowardice. The hardest, most obedient soldier in the film, played spectacularly by Michael Biehn, is a coward, and a man who is hopelessly in love with his estranged wife (Harris) turns that love into an act of suicidal heroism which might unintentionally save the world. And yet nothing is exactly as it seems to be, and there are really no spoilers in this review. There are so many subtle and sensitively developed themes in this film that it is hard to imagine a more epically human drama in the sci-fi genre. Even so, this is a film which entertains at every level, and will satisfy the action fan as much as the wannabe film critic. ;-) \n\nMost of the film takes place on an experimental submarine drilling platform owned by a petroleum company. A nuclear sub has been lost in "the abyss" - a subduction trench near the Caiman Islands - after encountering an impossibly fast object. Soon, the US military commandeers the platform and its command ship - The Benthic Explorer - to attempt a rescue mission. As everything begins to go wrong, and the encounters with strange phenomena continue, the Navy SEAL in charge of the rescue attempt begins to crack. Meanwhile, on the surface, accusations concerning the sub are escalating between the USSR and USA, and nuclear war seems immanent.

This is driving the long-term couple to the point of infidelity: a fact the ever-focused Fiona - whose life, to her, probably feels to be in a perfect if selfish equilibrium - is oblivious to. With Fiona's intense but comfortable world about to cave in around her, her increasing stress is not helped by the latest case she is working on: one where Adam ( Fionn Whitehead from "Dunkirk"), a Jehovah's Witness boy and a minor, is refusing on religious grounds the blood transfusion he desperately needs to fight his lukaemia. Fiona's decisions in the months ahead go much further than a simple judgement on the case.\n\nTwo acting giants - one born in London; one born in New York - tower over this Ian McEwan adaptation like leviathons. I bandy around the phrase "national treasure" a lot in my reviews, but here Emma Thompson is simply breathtakingly powerful in the lead role of Judge Fiona Maye, exhibiting such extremes of emotion that you would like to think that an Oscar nomination would be assured.

Please share and lobby people, lobby! Perhaps at the very least we can hope for some BAFTA recognition). \n\nSometimes a masterly lead performance can make a co-star performance seem unbalanced, but no such danger here. Stanley Tucci makes a perfect acting foil for Thompson: if he were a wine he would be described as "exasperation, frustration, compassion with strong notes of respect". And he carries it off with perfection.\n\nThis is an incredibly intelligent film, working on so many different levels and subject to so much interpretation. Fiona's feelings for the troubled teenager feel more maternal than sexual, but when those feelings become returned and escalate the whole piece develops a queasily oedipal quality. Many films have focused on illicit attractions between teacher and pupil, but here lies a new variation, with Maye fighting against her best professional insticts to 'do the right thing'. "I'm frightened of myself" she eventually wails to a colleague. \n\nIn his opening hospital scenes, (not withstanding the comic similarities between the guitar scene here and a certain scene in "Airplane"!), Adam seems completely other-wordly compared to a typical teen and this comes across as utterly false. That is, until you consider the oddness of his family background and Jehovah's Witness upbringing. As such, the film just about gets away with it. Whitehead does a good job with a difficult role. \n\nIf you've been in a court, you'll know that there is something regal and magical about a judge in full regalia entering a packed courtroom. So it's unusual to see the view from the other side of the door... a non-descript office corridor and a non-descript door. Helping the judge on this side of the door is her PA Nigel, played by the brilliant Jason Watkins: a TV regular (e.g. "Line of Duty", "W1A") but seen far less at the movies. \n\nAs a story of obsessive fixation, it borders on McEwan's disturbing earlier work "Enduring Love". And it has the potential to go in lots of interesting directions as a sort of bonkers platonic love triangle ("He wants to live with US?" splutters Tucci). Where the story does end up going was not particularly to my liking, and a melodramatic concert scene was - for me - a little overdone.

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is! She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie. In the end, the biggest treasure that was uncovered in this film may well be Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. I can't wait to see what she will do next. (Please note that Robert Redford is credited as Executive Producer.)\n\n"The Mustang" premiered to immediate acclaim at this year's Sundance film festival, It is not a coincidence that this movie is currently certified 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. "The Mustang" recently opened at my art-house movie theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people to be exact, myself included). That is a shame. Maybe the movie will find a wider audience as it is released in different formats. If you are up for a top-quality movie with a dazzling performance from Matthias Schoenaerts, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-06-19","keywords":"prison,horse,title directed by female,mustang the horse,wild mustang","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3905731097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A violent convict is given the chance to participate in a rehabilitation therapy program involving the training of wild mustangs."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774386/","name":"Matthias Schoenaerts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4207146/","name":"Jason Mitchell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001136/","name":"Bruce Dern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0641111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0807651/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2178754/","name":"Mona Fastvold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0635431/","name":"Brock Norman Brock"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's as if Ken Loach had made a film about the struggles of a single African mother with a debilitating medical condition fighting to survive. Pili faces hardship and the worse kind of exploitation however there are no evil characters here, everyone has a point of view, which makes this a profound film about the human condition. The film-makers show respect to the subject matter, it is never patronising and there are no silly or unbelievable scenes. I hardly ever write reviews and I'm surprised no one else has reviewed this film or that it has had to little coverage.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"one word title,title directed by female,female protagonist,black woman,hiv","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8234994/","name":"Bello Rashid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5401663/","name":"Nkwabi Elias Ng'angasamala","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8234995/","name":"Sesilia Florian Kilimila"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2801121/","name":"Leanne Welham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0220392/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8234998/","name":"Sophie Harman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2801121/","name":"Leanne Welham"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You can't even call this a black comedy because there is nothing remotely funny about the film but that doesn't mean it's a bad.\n\n It's the story of Inga , who runs a deeply indebted dairy farm in a remote valley in Iceland. After a tragic loss, she decides to rise up against the corrupt establishment exploiting her and the local community. This way the widowed farmer begins a new life on her own terms by fighting against corruption and injustice in her community.\n\nIf this was made in another country like The UK or The US , it would have had humour inserted and would probably had a shmaltzy ending. Obviously that's not what's done in Iceland .\n\nThis is more of a social statement about how small farms are bullied by big corporations and how one woman stood up to that . I enjoyed watching the fight against the Co op and the way the farmers rallied around but without giving anything away , the fight ends up being fruitless which gives us a strange , flat ending.\n\nOverall i was sold a different film from what i got but it was still very watchable .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You can't even call this a black comedy because there is nothing remotely funny about the film but that doesn't mean it's a bad.\n\n It's the story of Inga , who runs a deeply indebted dairy farm in a remote valley in Iceland. After a tragic loss, she decides to rise up against the corrupt establishment exploiting her and the local community. This way the widowed farmer begins a new life on her own terms by fighting against corruption and injustice in her community.\n\nIf this was made in another country like The UK or The US , it would have had humour inserted and would probably had a shmaltzy ending. Obviously that's not what's done in Iceland .\n\nThis is more of a social statement about how small farms are bullied by big corporations and how one woman stood up to that . I enjoyed watching the fight against the Co op and the way the farmers rallied around but without giving anything away , the fight ends up being fruitless which gives us a strange , flat ending.\n\nOverall i was sold a different film from what i got but it was still very watchable .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Tim runs towards being a dad, while Zoe runs away from being a mum. Terrified that her life won't be her own anymore, Zoe is still determined to tick off a list of their wildest dreams before the baby arrives. Zoe's increasing denial about her impending birth pushes her, and her relationship, to the limit. BABY DONE is a semi-autobiographical story inspired by the filmmakers' own reaction to starting a family.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4194124/","name":"Rose Matafeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507535/","name":"Matthew Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120593/","name":"Emily Barclay"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3555793/","name":"Curtis Vowell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0537672/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3089836/","name":"Sophie Henderson"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious.

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson.

I'm hooked to start, with a opening shot that's held uncomfortably long, ambitious considering the overall thrifty run time. It's stark with a retro grade and worn VHS look. The minimal aesthetic really appeals, but there's something missing, there's very little warmth or investment in the characters, with a palatable dirt on screen that permeates everything. For all the tension being ramped, the grime, the editing, the hyper scripted dialogue, it all slowly pulls apart. Despite it's stunted plot of a devilish nature and generally undesirable characters, there are some pluses. The score being one, reminiscent of an 80s slasher flick, it's definitely the films strongest asset. The European art house feel makes it feel cinematic, intentionally confusing in nature. Scenes built around slow creeping shots, almost entirely on one set, with often inactive people, waiting. Director Tillman Singer clearly has a thing for Lynch. As things progress it does manage to find its feet, with a second act reminiscent of a small theatre play, time frames overlapping, lines twisting through their own narrative into others, it's wonderfully bonkers, albeit a tad overplayed. It's all precursor to a truly off the wall finale, that although ambitious, really just doesn't work and ends in a bit of a disjointed mess. It really doesn't live up to its trailer, but I'm still pleased I gave it a go.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2352,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"demon,hypnosis,chamber drama,reality,one word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Luz","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726490649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer #1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9547430/","name":"Luana Velis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1919245/","name":"Johannes Benecke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849059/","name":"Jan Bluthardt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053103/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"}],"duration":"PT1H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm hooked to start, with a opening shot that's held uncomfortably long, ambitious considering the overall thrifty run time. It's stark with a retro grade and worn VHS look. The minimal aesthetic really appeals, but there's something missing, there's very little warmth or investment in the characters, with a palatable dirt on screen that permeates everything. For all the tension being ramped, the grime, the editing, the hyper scripted dialogue, it all slowly pulls apart. Despite it's stunted plot of a devilish nature and generally undesirable characters, there are some pluses. The score being one, reminiscent of an 80s slasher flick, it's definitely the films strongest asset. The European art house feel makes it feel cinematic, intentionally confusing in nature. Scenes built around slow creeping shots, almost entirely on one set, with often inactive people, waiting. Director Tillman Singer clearly has a thing for Lynch. As things progress it does manage to find its feet, with a second act reminiscent of a small theatre play, time frames overlapping, lines twisting through their own narrative into others, it's wonderfully bonkers, albeit a tad overplayed. It's all precursor to a truly off the wall finale, that although ambitious, really just doesn't work and ends in a bit of a disjointed mess. It really doesn't live up to its trailer, but I'm still pleased I gave it a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2352,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"demon,hypnosis,chamber drama,reality,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Luz","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726490649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer #1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9547430/","name":"Luana Velis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1919245/","name":"Johannes Benecke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849059/","name":"Jan Bluthardt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053103/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"],"duration":"PT1H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is considered an American literary classic, a staple in high school English courses. To tamper with greatness could spell disaster for the film and disappoint fans. With this in mind, Luhrmann took the details that made the novel so successful and generously applied them to his film.\n\nThe result? Beautiful visuals, awkward editing and overblown symbolism.\n\nThe adaptation is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), who recounts his adventures on Long Island to a doctor while at a sanatorium. Using word-for-word passages from the novel, Carraway describes his move to New York to try his hand in the bond business. There, he reconnects with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and learns his next-door neighbor is none other than Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), the secretive millionaire known for his lavish parties and fantastical reputation. Little does Carraway know that Gatsby acts this way in hopes of winning back Daisy's love despite five years of separation and her marriage to another man.\n\nHoping to live up to its hype, the movie tries to be as fantastic and flawless as Gatsby himself. Servants open doors and move about the house like choreographed dancers. The grand landscapes of New York City and Gatsby's estate look pristine. And the parties are a flapper's dream, with the vibrant outfits and music for dancing (although the occasional rap songs seemed a bit out of place).\n\nUnfortunately, the flawlessness stops with the visuals. Reminiscent of "Moulin Rouge," Luhrmann's excessive cuts put cinematic emphasis in all the wrong places. The opening scenes fly by with exaggerated zooming and cutaways that disturb the flow of the script. Yet during the climactic standoff between Gatsby and Daisy's husband, the camera comes to a virtual standstill. Without the dialogue, it would appear no different from any other scene.\n\nThe film was also keen to draw on, and overemphasize, some of the novel's best traits. Carraway speaks Fitzgerald's words like poetry, which fans of the book will appreciate. Yet seeing them additionally written on the screen is distracting and unnecessary, no matter how artistic the font is. Likewise, the symbolisms that added such value to the novel do not translate as well on screen. We can only see the green light so many times before its significance starts to fade. \n\nLuckily, the lead performances keep the plot comprehensible even when the camera is having a spaz attack. Few (if any) actors would be better suited as the suave, slightly obsessed Gatsby than DiCaprio.

F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is considered an American literary classic, a staple in high school English courses. To tamper with greatness could spell disaster for the film and disappoint fans. With this in mind, Luhrmann took the details that made the novel so successful and generously applied them to his film.\n\nThe result? Beautiful visuals, awkward editing and overblown symbolism.\n\nThe adaptation is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), who recounts his adventures on Long Island to a doctor while at a sanatorium. Using word-for-word passages from the novel, Carraway describes his move to New York to try his hand in the bond business. There, he reconnects with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and learns his next-door neighbor is none other than Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), the secretive millionaire known for his lavish parties and fantastical reputation. Little does Carraway know that Gatsby acts this way in hopes of winning back Daisy's love despite five years of separation and her marriage to another man.\n\nHoping to live up to its hype, the movie tries to be as fantastic and flawless as Gatsby himself. Servants open doors and move about the house like choreographed dancers. The grand landscapes of New York City and Gatsby's estate look pristine. And the parties are a flapper's dream, with the vibrant outfits and music for dancing (although the occasional rap songs seemed a bit out of place).\n\nUnfortunately, the flawlessness stops with the visuals. Reminiscent of "Moulin Rouge," Luhrmann's excessive cuts put cinematic emphasis in all the wrong places. The opening scenes fly by with exaggerated zooming and cutaways that disturb the flow of the script. Yet during the climactic standoff between Gatsby and Daisy's husband, the camera comes to a virtual standstill. Without the dialogue, it would appear no different from any other scene.\n\nThe film was also keen to draw on, and overemphasize, some of the novel's best traits. Carraway speaks Fitzgerald's words like poetry, which fans of the book will appreciate. Yet seeing them additionally written on the screen is distracting and unnecessary, no matter how artistic the font is. Likewise, the symbolisms that added such value to the novel do not translate as well on screen. We can only see the green light so many times before its significance starts to fade. \n\nLuckily, the lead performances keep the plot comprehensible even when the camera is having a spaz attack. Few (if any) actors would be better suited as the suave, slightly obsessed Gatsby than DiCaprio. He and Maguire enliven the unlikely relationship between Gatsby and Carraway with their occasional comic relief and intimate conversations. Mulligan also gives a strong portrayal of Daisy and her struggle to choose between Gatsby and her husband.\n\nThere is potential for the film to be marginally close to par with the novel. Unfortunately, it gets lost in the pomp of Luhrmann's chaotic editing, which proves what literary purists have been saying all along: Only the book can put the "great" in "The Great Gatsby."\n\nStars: *** ½ (out of 5)\n\nRead more: http://www.973radionow.com","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502649,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-05-15","keywords":"extramarital affair,obsessive love,party,fatal accident,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2949817881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.

Melinda is a sweetly disturbed, well intentioned, lonely girl who forces awkward moments with customers and who dips her finger in freshly brewed coffee to feel the heat she wishes to have with a man. There's an off kilter emptiness to Melinda that Cobham-Hervey puts front and center with an appropriate misleading elegance, creating a complex and dangerous character in a standout performance. And Waterhouse steals every scene she's in as the wise cracking Sheila who instigates and pushes boundaries with the chip on her shoulder and eye rolling attitude. The 2 are the perfect foil for Josh Hutcherson's Billy, the would be robber who wandered into the wrong gas station. Hutcherson is effective here, perfectly charming and convincingly hot headed when his charm fails him. Burn is a fantastic little thriller that unfolds slowly to reveal a twisted series of events, and its 3 stars are integral to its success in a dialogue heavy script. I don't know if there's good and evil in the gas station where Melinda works, maybe just a thin line in between the 2 extremes and Burn manages to toe that line and explore the grayest areas of life, the purgatory people create for themselves...or find themselves in. It's here where Melinda lives, on the edges of this thin line between good and evil in the seedy gas station of the highway called Paradise Pumps. And if heaven is paradise, this long night at Paradise Pumps proves that paradise is indeed lost. Burn is a great little gem, I hope people check this one out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4112,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-23","keywords":"gas","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433924121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlkZDQzYTktZTk5YS00NDEzLWJjMGMtMTI3ODQ0M2Q3YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlkZDQzYTktZTk5YS00NDEzLWJjMGMtMTI3ODQ0M2Q3YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"A gas-station stickup doesn't go as planned for anyone involved in 'Burn.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5315479/","name":"Tilda Cobham-Hervey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4025229/","name":"Suki Waterhouse"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6120217/","name":"Mike Gan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303286/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177700/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577945/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6120217/","name":"Mike Gan"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Their interactions with each other, and their development doesn't follow human rules, they are what is needed in the scene and that creates a disconnect that avoided me to enjoy the film. Most of it is also completely predictable, except for a twist near the end, and I'm not sure if I couldn't see due to the incoherence of it all at that point. I would have rated it at least 5 because it feels like a movie despite its flaws, but there are so many good reviews I feel like I need to warn others, thus this review.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-06","keywords":"miscarriage,secluded house,secret room,isolated house,magic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Room","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi487898649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgyNWJjODQtNTdmZC00NDc3LTk1MGEtNzYyZmJmM2I1ODBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgyNWJjODQtNTdmZC00NDc3LTk1MGEtNzYyZmJmM2I1ODBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1822271/","name":"Kevin Janssens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9920292/","name":"Joshua Wilson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1466691/","name":"Christian Volckman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071388/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0395973/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1466691/","name":"Christian Volckman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162056/","name":"Eric Forestier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1615033/","name":"Gaia Guasti"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Then I was home sick one day and caught it on cable. I laughed my butt off. This is a crude, rude and down right funny film. It also helped that I grew up near the Pennsylvania Dutch and plenty of bowling lanes. Two seemingly safe areas that the Farley brothers attack it without mercy. Sometimes it gets down right disgusting and many cannot stomach, but overall, its very funny.\n\nBill and Woody were funny as anything. The Disco-era beginning makes me laugh like crazy. The commercial Bill Murray does is to die for. This film will offend alot of people, and many references played for humor may make folks feel uncomfortable, but I loved it. If you are easily offended, this is NOT the film for you. But for everyone else who likes rude, crude and deviously funny -- often at the expense of others kinda humor, this is a gem to see.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Sport"],"datePublished":"1996-07-26","keywords":"bowling,amish,on the road,big breasts,breasts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi973258265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIwYWEzNGItNDJjNy00MDIwLWEyODEtMmVkNGY1ZDE0YTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIwYWEzNGItNDJjNy00MDIwLWEyODEtMmVkNGY1ZDE0YTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A star bowler whose career was prematurely "cut off" hopes to ride a new prodigy to success and riches."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001642/","name":"Randy Quaid"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000195/","name":"Bill Murray"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125803/","name":"Bobby Farrelly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268380/","name":"Peter Farrelly"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030480/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071430/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266673/","name":"Barry Fanaro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622240/","name":"Mort Nathan"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then I was home sick one day and caught it on cable. I laughed my butt off. This is a crude, rude and down right funny film. It also helped that I grew up near the Pennsylvania Dutch and plenty of bowling lanes. Two seemingly safe areas that the Farley brothers attack it without mercy. Sometimes it gets down right disgusting and many cannot stomach, but overall, its very funny.\n\nBill and Woody were funny as anything. The Disco-era beginning makes me laugh like crazy. The commercial Bill Murray does is to die for. This film will offend alot of people, and many references played for humor may make folks feel uncomfortable, but I loved it. If you are easily offended, this is NOT the film for you. But for everyone else who likes rude, crude and deviously funny -- often at the expense of others kinda humor, this is a gem to see.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Sport"],"datePublished":"1996-07-26","keywords":"bowling,amish,on the road,big breasts,breasts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi973258265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIwYWEzNGItNDJjNy00MDIwLWEyODEtMmVkNGY1ZDE0YTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIwYWEzNGItNDJjNy00MDIwLWEyODEtMmVkNGY1ZDE0YTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A star bowler whose career was prematurely "cut off" hopes to ride a new prodigy to success and riches.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001642/","name":"Randy Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000195/","name":"Bill Murray"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125803/","name":"Bobby Farrelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268380/","name":"Peter Farrelly"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030480/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071430/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266673/","name":"Barry Fanaro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622240/","name":"Mort Nathan"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Melinda is a sweetly disturbed, well intentioned, lonely girl who forces awkward moments with customers and who dips her finger in freshly brewed coffee to feel the heat she wishes to have with a man. There's an off kilter emptiness to Melinda that Cobham-Hervey puts front and center with an appropriate misleading elegance, creating a complex and dangerous character in a standout performance.

The 2 are the perfect foil for Josh Hutcherson's Billy, the would be robber who wandered into the wrong gas station. Hutcherson is effective here, perfectly charming and convincingly hot headed when his charm fails him. Burn is a fantastic little thriller that unfolds slowly to reveal a twisted series of events, and its 3 stars are integral to its success in a dialogue heavy script. I don't know if there's good and evil in the gas station where Melinda works, maybe just a thin line in between the 2 extremes and Burn manages to toe that line and explore the grayest areas of life, the purgatory people create for themselves...or find themselves in. It's here where Melinda lives, on the edges of this thin line between good and evil in the seedy gas station of the highway called Paradise Pumps. And if heaven is paradise, this long night at Paradise Pumps proves that paradise is indeed lost. Burn is a great little gem, I hope people check this one out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4112,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-23","keywords":"gas","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433924121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlkZDQzYTktZTk5YS00NDEzLWJjMGMtMTI3ODQ0M2Q3YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlkZDQzYTktZTk5YS00NDEzLWJjMGMtMTI3ODQ0M2Q3YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"A gas-station stickup doesn't go as planned for anyone involved in 'Burn.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5315479/","name":"Tilda Cobham-Hervey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4025229/","name":"Suki Waterhouse"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6120217/","name":"Mike Gan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303286/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177700/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577945/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6120217/","name":"Mike Gan"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't live in the USA but I imagine this is actually quite accurate in the way hospitals are run and that it is all about money and not necessarily doing what's best for the patient. \n\nThe characters so far are interesting - I'm 7 episodes in and I like that some patients are in it for longer than an episode. There are characters you want to root for the do gooders and there are characters you love to hate who are selfish, rich and really in the wrong business. Oh and there's a main character that's a nurse which is always a plus since we basically make the hospitals run! \n\nSo if you like medical dramas give it a go!

I don't live in the USA but I imagine this is actually quite accurate in the way hospitals are run and that it is all about money and not necessarily doing what's best for the patient. \n\nThe characters so far are interesting - I'm 7 episodes in and I like that some patients are in it for longer than an episode. There are characters you want to root for the do gooders and there are characters you love to hate who are selfish, rich and really in the wrong business. Oh and there's a main character that's a nurse which is always a plus since we basically make the hospitals run! \n\nSo if you like medical dramas give it a go! I've seen them all - ER is the best, I've got a soft spot for Greys Anatomy even though sometimes it's ridiculous m, Code Black is great, Chicago Med is alright, The night shift was good. They are all entertaining so in my mind they do what they are suppose to!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-21","keywords":"two word title,atlanta georgia,georgia,hospital,medical","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194516/","name":"Matt Czuchry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2110485/","name":"Manish Dayal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339304/","name":"Bruce Greenwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152181/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0683032/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427468/","name":"Amy Holden Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2735698/","name":"Hayley Schore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6149734/","name":"Roshan Sethi"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi528529689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RjODYyNTMtZTljZC00ZmViLWEzZmYtZjExNmM2Y2I2MTQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RjODYyNTMtZTljZC00ZmViLWEzZmYtZjExNmM2Y2I2MTQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Resident" follows Dr. Conrad Hawkins, one of the best doctors at Chastain Park Memorial Hospital.

Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. \n\nAs always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-26","keywords":"vigilante,prostitute,mysterious past,gangster,ex soldier","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1649060889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A former black ops commando who faked his death for a quiet life in Boston comes out of his retirement to rescue a young girl and finds himself face to face with Russian gangsters.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631269/","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0479739/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921013/","name":"Richard Wenk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805994/","name":"Michael Sloan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2030456/","name":"Richard Lindheim"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. \n\nAs always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-26","keywords":"vigilante,prostitute,mysterious past,gangster,ex soldier","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1649060889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A former black ops commando who faked his death for a quiet life in Boston comes out of his retirement to rescue a young girl and finds himself face to face with Russian gangsters.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631269/","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0479739/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921013/","name":"Richard Wenk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805994/","name":"Michael Sloan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2030456/","name":"Richard Lindheim"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.\n\nPlot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting—a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.\n\nThis movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. "Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride."-- Pete Hammond, Maxim" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.\n\nThe racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.\n\nOverall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I think it is a solid action movie, I love this film and it is a step above than 2 Fast 2 Furious by me.\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 American action film directed by Justin Lin, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Chris Morgan. It takes place between the events of sixth and seventh films. The film stars Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee and Sung Kang.\n\n8/10 Score: A- Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Sung Kang, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee, Leonardo Nam, Brian Goodman, Zachery Ty Bryan, Nikki Griffin, Sonny Chiba and Vin Diesel Director: Justin Lin Producer: Neal H.

That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.\n\nThe racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.\n\nOverall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I think it is a solid action movie, I love this film and it is a step above than 2 Fast 2 Furious by me.\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 American action film directed by Justin Lin, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Chris Morgan. It takes place between the events of sixth and seventh films. The film stars Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee and Sung Kang.\n\n8/10 Score: A- Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Sung Kang, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee, Leonardo Nam, Brian Goodman, Zachery Ty Bryan, Nikki Griffin, Sonny Chiba and Vin Diesel Director: Justin Lin Producer: Neal H.

In search of answers to their questions, they devour themselves like a chemical substance that corrodes the world around, in order to eventually learn not to listen but to hear, not to look but to see. And to find their way. Sacha and Petya live the crazy life of young musicians in modern-day Moscow: loud parties, ups and downs, the wheel of unstable relationships with others and themselves. Knowing the importance of love, family, and opportunity, but feeling lonely and disconnected, has left them both with a sense that they are corroding from the inside.

 --- Description: Kislota: Directed by Aleksandr Gorchilin. With Filipp Avdeev, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, Roza Khayrullina, Elena Morozova. Acid is a silent manifesto of the generation of twenty-year-old. They have been abandoned in a world adorned with concepts such as family, friendship, love, and opportunities. In search of answers to their questions, they devour themselves like a chemical substance that corrodes the world around, in order to eventually learn not to listen but to hear, not to look but to see. And to find their way. Sacha and Petya live the crazy life of young musicians in modern-day Moscow: loud parties, ups and downs, the wheel of unstable relationships with others and themselves. Knowing the importance of love, family, and opportunity, but feeling lonely and disconnected, has left them both with a sense that they are corroding from the inside. Suddenly an event occurs in their lives that requires them both to take an honest look at themselves." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt8304276/","name":"Kislota","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2QwYjJhNzQtZDUwNC00NWIxLWE2OGMtMzljYzk2Zjc2ODU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzY2NDI0NzU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Acid is a silent manifesto of the generation of twenty-year-old.

As the movie opens, it is immediately clear that homosexuality is prohibited in Nigeria, driving gays and others in the LGTBQ+ community underground. We are introduced to Micheal, who describes his ordeal, which led him to move to the US. Now, after 7 years away, he plans a return visit to Nigeria to see for himself how things have changed (if at all)... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.\n\nCouple of comments: this film is co-directed by Giselle Bailey and Nneka Onuorah. Equally important, the film is produced by John Legend's Get Lifted film company. To say that Nigeria is a dangerous place for the LGTBQ+ community, would be the understatement of the year. The Nigerian authorities are openly and without any shame or scruples encouraging the hunting down of anyone suspected to be "different", leading to senseless and shameful violence against those who are "different". Beware: there is shocking footage in the film of such incidents that I found difficult to stomach, which of course is the entire point of having that footage in the film. Kudos to the film makers, who clearly spent a significant amount of time "embedded" in the LGTBQ+ community to provide this rich yet frightening portrait.\n\n"The Legend of the Underground" premiered earlier this week on HBO and is not available on HBO On Demand, HBO Max, Amazon Instant Video and other streaming services. The DVD/Blu-ray release will follow in due course. If you want to get a clear sense on what life is like for the LGTBQ+ in a truly homophobic county like Nigeria, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-06-29","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1698676761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MDJkYjQtOGNlZS00ODU1LTlhZWMtMmUzNDY1OWQxYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MDJkYjQtOGNlZS00ODU1LTlhZWMtMmUzNDY1OWQxYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Accessible original trailer."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12656508/","name":"James Brown"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6319114/","name":"Denrele"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7250120/","name":"Denrele Edun"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4054614/","name":"Giselle Bailey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5283727/","name":"Nneka Onuorah"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0351101/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0154622/"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the movie opens, it is immediately clear that homosexuality is prohibited in Nigeria, driving gays and others in the LGTBQ+ community underground. We are introduced to Micheal, who describes his ordeal, which led him to move to the US. Now, after 7 years away, he plans a return visit to Nigeria to see for himself how things have changed (if at all)... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.\n\nCouple of comments: this film is co-directed by Giselle Bailey and Nneka Onuorah. Equally important, the film is produced by John Legend's Get Lifted film company. To say that Nigeria is a dangerous place for the LGTBQ+ community, would be the understatement of the year. The Nigerian authorities are openly and without any shame or scruples encouraging the hunting down of anyone suspected to be "different", leading to senseless and shameful violence against those who are "different". Beware: there is shocking footage in the film of such incidents that I found difficult to stomach, which of course is the entire point of having that footage in the film. Kudos to the film makers, who clearly spent a significant amount of time "embedded" in the LGTBQ+ community to provide this rich yet frightening portrait.\n\n"The Legend of the Underground" premiered earlier this week on HBO and is not available on HBO On Demand, HBO Max, Amazon Instant Video and other streaming services. The DVD/Blu-ray release will follow in due course. If you want to get a clear sense on what life is like for the LGTBQ+ in a truly homophobic county like Nigeria, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-06-29","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1698676761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MDJkYjQtOGNlZS00ODU1LTlhZWMtMmUzNDY1OWQxYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MDJkYjQtOGNlZS00ODU1LTlhZWMtMmUzNDY1OWQxYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Accessible original trailer.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12656508/","name":"James Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6319114/","name":"Denrele","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7250120/","name":"Denrele Edun"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4054614/","name":"Giselle Bailey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5283727/","name":"Nneka Onuorah"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0351101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0154622/"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was hilarious the first time you told it. So you kept telling it over and over again. You told your mom, your friends, your wacky uncle and heck you even told it to your baby sister. Each time you tell that joke it lost some of its charm and you know this in your heart, but you keep telling it because it made you someone who was at least bearable at the office party. The Hangover Part III is THAT dreaded, self-destructive joke. \n\nThe first The Hangover was a surprise to everyone. It was a smart, engaging and an all-around funny move. It made the three protagonists into overnight stars, along with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Since The Hangover these four guys have experienced great success; Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became a little more then Andy from The Office, and Zach Galifianakis (the funniest of the bunch) starred on HBO's Bored to Death and Ken Jeong is a recurring character on Community. It's no surprise then that The Hangover made these guys in demand, and had the audience craving for more. So what better way to give the masses what they want than bringing the Wolf Pack back together for two more subpar movies. The Hangover Part III brings the crew back together for yet another wacky adventure, this time getting them to go to Tijuana and back to Vegas. There isn't really much to tell you about the plot that you can't figure out yourself. So it makes very little sense to go in any further detail about it, and I can move on to things that worked.\n\nBy far the funniest moment during the movie for my money's worth was when some girl in the theater screamed out loud after seeing one of the main character dangle for his life. The whole theater roared, and it was a genuinely hilarious moment. Too bad the same can't be said about the rest of the movie. No doubt there were some funny moments and personally the best bits of the movie were when Melissa Mccarthy was on the screen. Some of the other funniest moments were throwbacks to the original. I found myself doing a lot of "ooh I remember that from the first movie. Ha ha that reference is funny." Unfortunately that is all this movie is, it's a reminder of how great The Hangover was and we should nostalgia- laugh (is something I just made up) because we once thought there was no one funnier than Zack Galifianakis. Other than that any original content was drab at best. \n\nThe best laughs came from all the supporting characters, and the 'Big 3' it felt like were just there to collect the pay check. Bradly Cooper was by far the worst of the bunch. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who was nominated for an Oscar not very long ago. Ed Helms and Zack Galifianakis were at least trying.\n\nIt was the overall chemistry of the three characters that made the original so great. The Hangover was a perfect recipe of Mac and Cheese where you threw in random ingredients and IT WAS THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE YOU EVER MADE! You tried replicating the original time after time, and tasted nothing but cheese and disappointment. It was just another Mac and Cheese. Sure it was served its purpose of feeding your broke student ass, but you yearned for that perfect gourmet Mac and Cheese fit to serve Gordon Ramsay himself. \n\nThe Hangover Part III is not a movie for people who are looking for genuine comedy. There are some very funny moments but the cheap laughs far outnumber the good ones. If you're going in expecting a repeat of The Hangover then don't waste your time and money. If you were disappointed by The Hangover Part II this movie will only throw salt on your wounds. It's sad to see such an initially brilliant trilogy end like this. Hangover 3 was nothing but one last attempt at squeezing every last dollar from the franchise. The Hangover Part III gets 5 nostalgia-laughs out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":302444,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

Maybe the undead do not like the cold. He find himself trapped between various warring factions, including a ruthless CEO (Dennis Hopper) who offers safety to the wealthy while allowing the unwashed masses to fend for themselves, a fellow mercenary (John Leguizamo) who will sacrifice anyone to advance his own agenda, and hordes of zombies who are starting to take steps up the evolutionary ladder.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As the film opens, Luis is at the doctor's office in New York for a check-up visit following a heart attack a year earlier. We then go back in time, as we learn of Luis' upbringing in Puerto Rico, including his protesting days at the University of Puerto Rico in the early 70s. In 1974 he comes to New York for a graduate degree at NYU, and before he knows it, he gets involved politically, and eventually is hired by Ed Koch as his liaison to the local Puerto Rican and other Latino communities... At this point we are 10 min. into the documentary.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the debut film of writer-producer-director John James. He seems to have been given unfettered access to Luis and his family, including his son Lin-Manuel Miranda, a/k/a/ the writer-creator of "Hamilton" (yes, the Broadway sensation). Besides examining Luis' political career, the movie centers around the father-and-son's attempt to bring the "Hamilton" touring production to Puerto Rico in order to raise funds after the devastation to Puerto Rico brought by Hurricane Maria in the fall of 2017. I was generally unfamiliar with the background of Luis Miranda (or his son), and the only thing I can conclude is that Luis has an amazing level of energy that he brings to whatever he is focusing on, be it in politics, or for the love of Puerto Rico, or his family. By the way, if you are hoping to catch a glimpse of the actual "Hamilton" play, fuggetaboutit (probably for contractual reasons) although there is a delightful clip of Lin-Manuel giving a sneak-peak of one song back in 2009 at the Obama White House (yes, 5 years before "Hamilton" reached Broadway). Bottom line: this is a fast-moving and enjoyable bio-doc about a colorful figure in the New York/Puerto Rico political world (and so much more).\n\n"Siempre, Luis" premiered on HBO this week, and is now available on HBO On Demand and other streaming services. If you have any interest in Puerto Rico or in "Hamilton", I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["Documentary","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2443297049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM5NDlhNWUtY2NiYS00MzE5LWEyNTEtNTYwYzE2NDU3ZDQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM5NDlhNWUtY2NiYS00MzE5LWEyNTEtNTYwYzE2NDU3ZDQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The documentary tells the story of pioneering activist Luis A.

The mission could not go worse as Bond kills the man in an embassy in front of CCTV cameras. Removed from the mission by M, Bond nevertheless follows the only lead he has to Miami where he finds himself working round the edges of a plot by criminal Le Chiffre to invest his clients money in the stock market just before an engineered event should send shares in a direction favourable for him.\n\nAfter the poor CGI and overblown (if fun) affair that was Die Another Day, the series was at risk of just throwing more and more money at the screen in an attempt to exaggerate and increase the Bond formula to keep fans happy. And, in fairness it seems financially to be working for them but this is not to say that the drastically scaled back feel of Casino Royale is not a welcome change of direction for the series, because for me it most certainly was. Opening with a gritty, short and violent pre-credit sequence, the film moves through a cool title sequence with a typically Bondian (if only so-so) theme song. The film then immediately marks itself out as a step away from the previous film by launching on a great action sequence that is as overblown as the series requires but yet is all the better for seeming real  no ropy Die Another Day CGI here. Casting free-runner Foucan was a great move and this sequence was the high for me. After this the film develops nicely with a solid plot that engaged me easily enough, with interesting characters along the way.\n\nOf course this isn't to say that the series has suddenly put out an introspective character piece, because the world of Bond is all still here. So we have superhuman stunts, gadgets (albeit a practical self-defibrillator as opposed to a mini-helicopter) and the usual types of characters going the way we expect. Those expecting this self-styled "reboot" to provide a depth and emotion that isn't there will be disappointed but regardless this does the Bond formula well  fans will enjoy it and those that were turned off by Die Another Day will find it a welcome return to darker territory. With all the fanboys tired from bemoaning Craig, it is nice to actually see for ourselves what he can do and mostly he is very good. He convinces as a heartless killer and has the presence that suggests that he could do ruthless damage if he had to. I was a bit put off by how regularly he pouts but generally he brings a gravitas to the character that it benefits from. Green is a pretty good Bond girl and brings much, much more to the role than Berry did in the last film. Mikkelsen is a good foil for Bond and is given more interest by his lack of stature (he is essentially facing his last role of the dice in several ways). Dench is as solid as ever while Wright makes a shrewd move in a small character that offers more of the same for a few years to come.\n\nOverall then this is not the brilliant, flawless film that many have claimed, but I completely understand why it has been greeted with such praise. Sat beside Die Another Day, it is a wonderfully dark and brooding Bond with great action replacing some of the CGI and gadget excesses of recent times. Those upset at his blue eyes are best left fuming on the net, because Craig is a great Bond  capable of being dark with the violence and offering the potential for more if the material comes to meet him. A refreshing film with the bond formula in place but with a dark and comparatively restrained tone that makes it realistic enough to get into while still existing in the spy fantasy world."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":600019,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-11-15","keywords":"poker,poker game,adultery,bond girl,espionage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Casino Royale","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1859520025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAxYzc2YTItMjhjZi00Y2E5LWFhYWMtNzY4ODFlZmQ2MzJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAxYzc2YTItMjhjZi00Y2E5LWFhYWMtNzY4ODFlZmQ2MzJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Casino Royale"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200563/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353673/","name":"Paul Haggis"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Think about this - Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years, and his earliest release date is 2039. Charles Manson has been getting regular parole hearings since the 1990s. Who is more dangerous? A better question is who is more dangerous to the plutocracy. \n\nThe whole story is basically done in flashback after Madoff is incarcerated and is being interviewed by a reporter. This film takes the approach of assuming that the wife and sons knew nothing until Bernie told them right before he was arrested. If there is anything the Bernie Madoff story would teach you, it is "Don't steal from the very rich". The movie emphasized all of the little people who lost everything to the Ponzi scheme, but there were enough people with enough money left over - as in hundreds of millions - that they could hire attorneys and even claw back money from people who withdrew all of their money before Bernie went bust, even though they knew nothing of the scheme. Compare that to what happened to the banksters who swindled the entire nation - which was absolutely nothing, or Enron, where the Bush administration had to practically be shamed into prosecuting the executives who swindled investors. To date about 70% of the money Bernie Madoff swindled has been recovered, with "small" investors - those that invested less than a million - being made completely whole.\n\nAnyways, back to "The Wizard", which doesn't mention any of this. DeNiro was terrific as a guy who decided to keep his swindling secret to himself - and one smarmy associate played by Hank Azaria. Michelle Pfeiffer as Ruth Madoff almost stole the show from DeNiro as a woman who can't deal with being ostracized and hated for something she had nothing to do with. She wonders aloud how she got to be almost 70 and never learned to do anything for herself. De Niro's Madoff is shown as being able to compartmentalize how he is stealing from investors, many of whom are family and friends, encouraging those at the end to put in huge amounts of money to keep the scheme afloat in the wake of the 2008 crash, which is ultimately what did him in, and somehow sees taking what is left of his ill gotten gains and distributing it to his family and "a few loyal employees" before he turns himself in as "noblesse oblige" not just more theft, which it was.\n\nHints to Madoff's personality are in the little scenes. He is very stoic about being the world's biggest and most brazen thief caught to date, but he does get animated about a dirty dish and the way lobster is served at a society dinner he is hosting. \n\nThere is one particularly odd scene for Turner Classic Movie fans. At one point, while Bernie is under house arrest, Bernie and his wife decide to commit suicide in "a nice way" using Ambien and a bunch of other pharmaceuticals they have around the house. It doesn't work - they wake up the next morning. But as they lay in bed expecting to die, who pops up on the TV screen they are watching but the recently deceased Robert Osborne and TCM with him introducing Judy Garland singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas".

A better question is who is more dangerous to the plutocracy. \n\nThe whole story is basically done in flashback after Madoff is incarcerated and is being interviewed by a reporter. This film takes the approach of assuming that the wife and sons knew nothing until Bernie told them right before he was arrested. If there is anything the Bernie Madoff story would teach you, it is "Don't steal from the very rich". The movie emphasized all of the little people who lost everything to the Ponzi scheme, but there were enough people with enough money left over - as in hundreds of millions - that they could hire attorneys and even claw back money from people who withdrew all of their money before Bernie went bust, even though they knew nothing of the scheme. Compare that to what happened to the banksters who swindled the entire nation - which was absolutely nothing, or Enron, where the Bush administration had to practically be shamed into prosecuting the executives who swindled investors. To date about 70% of the money Bernie Madoff swindled has been recovered, with "small" investors - those that invested less than a million - being made completely whole.\n\nAnyways, back to "The Wizard", which doesn't mention any of this. DeNiro was terrific as a guy who decided to keep his swindling secret to himself - and one smarmy associate played by Hank Azaria. Michelle Pfeiffer as Ruth Madoff almost stole the show from DeNiro as a woman who can't deal with being ostracized and hated for something she had nothing to do with. She wonders aloud how she got to be almost 70 and never learned to do anything for herself. De Niro's Madoff is shown as being able to compartmentalize how he is stealing from investors, many of whom are family and friends, encouraging those at the end to put in huge amounts of money to keep the scheme afloat in the wake of the 2008 crash, which is ultimately what did him in, and somehow sees taking what is left of his ill gotten gains and distributing it to his family and "a few loyal employees" before he turns himself in as "noblesse oblige" not just more theft, which it was.\n\nHints to Madoff's personality are in the little scenes. He is very stoic about being the world's biggest and most brazen thief caught to date, but he does get animated about a dirty dish and the way lobster is served at a society dinner he is hosting. \n\nThere is one particularly odd scene for Turner Classic Movie fans. At one point, while Bernie is under house arrest, Bernie and his wife decide to commit suicide in "a nice way" using Ambien and a bunch of other pharmaceuticals they have around the house. It doesn't work - they wake up the next morning. But as they lay in bed expecting to die, who pops up on the TV screen they are watching but the recently deceased Robert Osborne and TCM with him introducing Judy Garland singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas".

I am male, mid sixties, and have watched, like many others, all the great (and not-so-great) horror films. After watching the ten episodes of 'The Handmaid's Tale' I can safely say that THIS is a real horror story. It makes the entire horror genre seem like cotton candy. After each episode I find myself shaking, often with tears in my eyes. I'm not going to talk about the story. I am going to tell you that the acting is beyond reproach. In almost every movie, every TV series, there are at least one or two characters that don't fit or are poorly portrayed. Not so here. I simply cannot find fault with the performances of the entire cast. Stellar! The sets, the direction, the camera work, the intensity all fit together seamlessly. This is a story of a good world...gone very wrong. This is a story about faith, twisted by evil intent, then thrust upon the common people. For me it is truly horrifying. I'm sorry I can't find better words to describe how this show affects me. I will say this: My daughter is currently attending university in the U.S. and I can tell you I fear for her safety every hour of every day. Not because this story is happening now...but because it is so close.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200987,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-04-26","keywords":"rape,dystopia,violence against women,slavery,torture","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088803/","name":"Yvonne Strahovski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071026/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108881/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588005/","name":"Bruce Miller"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2726412313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Freedom is just the beginning.

When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo.

In short, the music is superb.\n\nThe voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film.

When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.\n\nAs charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.\n\nThe sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.\n\nThe voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes  from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.\n\nGorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":983049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-03","keywords":"pufferfish,shark,great barrier reef,short term memory loss,protective father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2687214105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home.

From the halls of power in Chamberlain's London to the halls of power in Stalin's Moscow, a story unfolds drawn from the real life of a young Welsh diplomatic attache/turned reporter named Gareth Jones (James Norton). Jones' desire to investigate the USSR's mysterious source of cash for their worldwide industrial spending spree turns into a fast-paced, life and death series of events that include a trip into the wintry hell of starving Ukrainian villagers, the debauched revelry of foreign journalists in Moscow, international blackmail, and what it means to uphold the cause of truth and justice against all odds. Outstanding performances by James Norton as Gareth Jones, the main protagonist and Peter Sarsgaard as the Pulitzer prize winning (and since discredited) journalist Walter Duranty.

From the halls of power in Chamberlain's London to the halls of power in Stalin's Moscow, a story unfolds drawn from the real life of a young Welsh diplomatic attache/turned reporter named Gareth Jones (James Norton). Jones' desire to investigate the USSR's mysterious source of cash for their worldwide industrial spending spree turns into a fast-paced, life and death series of events that include a trip into the wintry hell of starving Ukrainian villagers, the debauched revelry of foreign journalists in Moscow, international blackmail, and what it means to uphold the cause of truth and justice against all odds. Outstanding performances by James Norton as Gareth Jones, the main protagonist and Peter Sarsgaard as the Pulitzer prize winning (and since discredited) journalist Walter Duranty.

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Granted one wish, Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1217209/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jeev7882"},"dateCreated":"2012-06-24","inLanguage":"English","name":"A Brave New Film From Pixar","reviewBody":"There's quite a bit about Brave that has marked it as a departure from Pixar's typical fare. The most memorable trailer was one of the best scenes from the movie, with Merida protesting her marriage by shooting for her own hand. That scene alone showcases the detail and quality of animation we've come to expect from Pixar. No other studio has managed to come near what they do. The motion of the characters is natural. Merida's gorgeous curly red hair is distracting in its details only at the perfect times. And, most impressively, when Merida holds her breath to shoot her last arrow the audience holds its collective breath as we watch her arrow shoot away in slow motion and in a beautiful use of depth of field that reminds us why 2D is still highly preferred to 3D.\n\nThat's not to say Brave is quite as visually astonishing as Sully's fur in Monsters Inc., the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo, or a landfill laden Earth in Wall-E. But, in some ways, it's not meant to be. We're dealing with a primarily human cast for once, and ones meant to look very different than the ones in Up.\n\nBeyond the animation, the story is somewhat flat. The trailers do an excellent job of concealing the twists, but the twists are all easy to see well ahead of time. The story revolves around Princess Merida who is continually at odds with her Mother, Elinor. At the center of their arguments: marriage. Merida is to be married to the first born of one of the leaders of the other three clans. She'll have none of it as she'd much rather ride off on her own and perfect her archery skills than sit at home and be a proper Princess. In her more childish qualities, she's like her father: an overgrown warrior child who also happens to be King. It's not a bad story, but it's certainly a little too basic. Most people will most likely find the lack of creativity in the script's details the biggest disappointment in Brave.

The most memorable trailer was one of the best scenes from the movie, with Merida protesting her marriage by shooting for her own hand. That scene alone showcases the detail and quality of animation we've come to expect from Pixar. No other studio has managed to come near what they do. The motion of the characters is natural. Merida's gorgeous curly red hair is distracting in its details only at the perfect times. And, most impressively, when Merida holds her breath to shoot her last arrow the audience holds its collective breath as we watch her arrow shoot away in slow motion and in a beautiful use of depth of field that reminds us why 2D is still highly preferred to 3D.\n\nThat's not to say Brave is quite as visually astonishing as Sully's fur in Monsters Inc., the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo, or a landfill laden Earth in Wall-E. But, in some ways, it's not meant to be. We're dealing with a primarily human cast for once, and ones meant to look very different than the ones in Up.\n\nBeyond the animation, the story is somewhat flat. The trailers do an excellent job of concealing the twists, but the twists are all easy to see well ahead of time. The story revolves around Princess Merida who is continually at odds with her Mother, Elinor. At the center of their arguments: marriage. Merida is to be married to the first born of one of the leaders of the other three clans. She'll have none of it as she'd much rather ride off on her own and perfect her archery skills than sit at home and be a proper Princess. In her more childish qualities, she's like her father: an overgrown warrior child who also happens to be King. It's not a bad story, but it's certainly a little too basic. Most people will most likely find the lack of creativity in the script's details the biggest disappointment in Brave. There's no moments where we marvel "how did these guys come up with this?" \n\nIt's a pity because Merida is one of the best protagonists Pixar has been blessed with. She's likable and hate-able in all the right ways. She has quite a bit of bratty teenager in her - as evidenced by the lack of morality she displays in trying to change her mother's mind about her upcoming betrothal - and yet heaps of bravery - as she shows when confronted with what she's done to her Mother. The best part about Merida and the story is that she's the one continually driving it forward and making the choices. That proves vital as the film doesn't really have a villain. This isn't a good vs. evil battle like all their other movies not named Finding Nemo.\n\nBrave falls somewhere in the middle for Pixar. It's great that it's original (especially with Pixar selling out and giving us Monster's Inc. 2 and Toy Story 4 shortly), it's great the protagonist is female and so well rounded, and it's great the animation is somewhat subdued for once. I can't help but feel that Brave lacks some of the magic and creativity that really separate the upper echelon of Pixar's best work from the rest of it. Of course, that'll still probably be enough to make it the best animated movie of the year.\n\nFor more reviews like this one as well as other movie musings, go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":388706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"princess,mother daughter relationship,archery,female warrior,rebellious daughter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Families Legend","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678863641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom.

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself.

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious.

So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.\n\nDerek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-02-27","keywords":"male model,fashion model,conspiracy,fashion,malaysia","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852132/","name":"Christine Taylor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045189/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766153/","name":"Drake Sather"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357453/","name":"John Hamburg"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever  I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending. If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' "Oscar" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever  I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending. If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' "Oscar" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.\n\nIf you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an "epic," and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).\n\nA great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.\n\nThe casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.\n\nWithout giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1029882,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-08-16","keywords":"surprise ending,criminal mastermind,criminal,suspect,unreliable narrator","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Usual Suspects","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717188377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI2NTk3ODQtYWFiNC00NDgxLTkxY2UtYTNhNTI3YTNkNzdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI2NTk3ODQtYWFiNC00NDgxLTkxY2UtYTNhNTI3YTNkNzdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Gramercy Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000321/","name":"Gabriel Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106129/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033402/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082030/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.\n\nIf you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an "epic," and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).\n\nA great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.\n\nThe casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.\n\nWithout giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1029882,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-08-16","keywords":"surprise ending,criminal mastermind,criminal,suspect,unreliable narrator","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Usual Suspects","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717188377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI2NTk3ODQtYWFiNC00NDgxLTkxY2UtYTNhNTI3YTNkNzdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI2NTk3ODQtYWFiNC00NDgxLTkxY2UtYTNhNTI3YTNkNzdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Gramercy Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000321/","name":"Gabriel Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106129/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033402/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082030/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As an avid enthusiast of Hawaii, traveling there every year when time allows, I tend to like Elvis movies filmed in Hawaii more than the others. I would have loved to have visited Hawaii in the days of "Blue Hawaii" and "Paradise, Hawaiian Style," and it's cool to see what it looked like in those days. The Polynesian Cultural Center especially. This movie may not be the best Elvis had to offer, but it showcases Kauai in all its amazing beauty.

I would have to agree with most of the posters that this is not Elvis's best Hawaii flick, but it sure shows off Kauai in all its tropical beauty. It can't be denied that the plot lines of the typical Elvis movie are rarely very deep, and this one is no different. But I still find entertainment in all of them. Even "Paradise, Hawaiian Style." As an avid enthusiast of Hawaii, traveling there every year when time allows, I tend to like Elvis movies filmed in Hawaii more than the others. I would have loved to have visited Hawaii in the days of "Blue Hawaii" and "Paradise, Hawaiian Style," and it's cool to see what it looked like in those days. The Polynesian Cultural Center especially. This movie may not be the best Elvis had to offer, but it showcases Kauai in all its amazing beauty. It may be a little silly in its plot line, but it's still fun.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy","Musical"],"datePublished":"1966-06-15","keywords":"beach party,psychotronic film,sexual harassment,tiki bar,luau","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000062/","name":"Elvis Presley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0500299/","name":"Suzanna Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0793363/","name":"James Shigeta"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601077/","name":"Michael D.

Heinous!","reviewBody":"There's a reason why time travel has remained a staple of science-fiction for more than a  century - human beings will always be curious about the past as well as the future. To be able to fix past mistakes with the advantage of hindsight or to know what to expect in the years to come are basic human desires common to everyone.\n\nThe producers of "Timeline" may have benefited from owning a time machine. If they had taken a ride in Marty McFly's DeLorean they might have been able to prevent the mistakes in casting and scripting and made something that lives up to the idea's potential.\n\nAn archeological team led by Professor Edward Johnston (Billy Connolly) is excavating the ruins of Castlegard, site of a medieval battle between the French and the British during the Hundred Year War. Johnston's son Chris (Paul Walker) is visiting, a man not interested in the past but in getting closer to his father's assistant Kate Erikson (Frances O'Connor).\n\nTrouble arises when Professor Johnston goes to his benefactor, the International Technology Corporation, to get more funds and information about why they are so interested in Castlegard. When he does not return Chris, accompanied with Kate, historian and medieval weapons expert Andre Marek (Gerard Butler), physics expert Dave Stern (Ethan Embry) and Francois (Rossif Sutherland) head to the company headquarters to figure out where Johnston has gone.\n\nIt seems ITC, lead by Robert Doniger (David Thewlis), has stumbled onto a worm hole that leads back to 1357 while trying to perfect teleportation. Professor Johnston went back to see the era first-hand but got stuck there, and now his students must go back to rescue him. However, there's a catch, the group must collect him in six hours, otherwise they'll be stuck in the 14th century forever.\n\nThe movie could have been great had the filmmakers taken more time to examine its premise, but as it stands the plot is just mechanical. Once in the past the group just goes from one incident to another in a single-minded goal of rescuing Johnston.\n\nThere is no moment of wonder at the medieval world or any insights that looking into the past might reveal to 21st century travelers throughout the film. The visitors' knowledge of the area and upcoming battle do indeed come in handy, but they use this information only to survive and not to learn anything worthwhile.\n\nThe movie certainly looks good, with some fine attention to period details. The clothing and buildings look authentic, though the people inhabiting them are a bit cleaner then they would have been. The siege on the castle is also well filmed with trebuchets and catapults launching flaming bombs at Castlegard.\n\nHowever, for a movie about survival and battle, everything is handled apathetically. The characters seem to be going through the motions when delivering their lines and there isn't much tension in the fight scenes. It adds up to a boring action movie, and boring is one thing an action movie should never be.\n\nIt's also funny to see a film so selective about being authentic, such as making it a point that modern people should not carry modern equipment with them to influence history, but having medieval characters speak modern versions of English and French. It's also a strange that the movie takes sides, portraying the English as evil tyrannts and the French as noble defenders of their home. In reality, both sides were ruthless during that era.\n\nAs an actor, Walker comes off as a poor man's Keanu Reeves. You read that right - Walker makes Reeves look like a nuanced performer by comparison. He shouts lines with little conviction and acts like a dork through most of the film.\n\nIn fact, with the exception or Butler's Marek, it seems like amateur night in the acting department. A scene where O'Connors' Kate breaks down crying will have people laughing. Even Embry, normally an okay actor, gives an unmoving performance. His character stays behind in the present and comes off as the "self-righteous scientist" who squares off against Thewlis' heartless business man, a typical feature of this movie type.\n\nDirector Richard Donner once made great movies like "Superman" and "Lethal Weapon" but can't rescue this mess. It's been five years since he's done a movie, and he seems rusty. The camerawork and set design are both excellent though, and belong in a better movie.\n\nLike most stories by Michael Crichton, "Timeline" makes scientists into noble humanitarians and corporate heads into greedy slime to create artificial drama, and it comes off as exploitive pabulum that detracts from where the attention should be, on the action.\n\nSince the action isn't good, what's left is a story where the heroes cry, complain and act selfishly while the movie tries to convince us that they're intriguing characters we should care about. "Timeline" is a wholly forgettable experience, and memories of the movie will be teleported out of the minds of the audience not long after leaving the theater.\n\nFive out of ten stars. Just stick to the "Lethal Weapon" series Mr. Donner, and Mr. Crichton, please exhibit caution before letting another one of your novels be ruined with a horrible on screen versions (but then, you haven't had a good reputation of doing that).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61904,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-04-14","keywords":"time machine,self experimentation,accidental time travel,backwards time travel,time travel into the past","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Timeline","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3170304281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRjOWJlMWMtZDI4NC00N2QxLTllYzItOWYzOGJlNzNiM2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRjOWJlMWMtZDI4NC00N2QxLTllYzItOWYzOGJlNzNiM2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908094/","name":"Paul Walker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0175262/","name":"Billy Connolly"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001149/","name":"Richard Donner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536587/","name":"Jeff Maguire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There were scenes that made you cringe, some made you scream, and some made your heart beat race, but the proportion from boring scenes to engaging ones was unbalanced.\n\nwww.chorror.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-05-07","keywords":"surgery,open heart surgery,pain,nudity,fiance fiancee relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical trailer: Awake","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4138795289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzM1Mjg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgzNTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzM1Mjg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgzNTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the U.S. theatrical trailer for Awake, directed by Joby Harold.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159789/","name":"Hayden Christensen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004695/","name":"Jessica Alba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005024/","name":"Terrence Howard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1703612/","name":"Joby Harold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0025423/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0091401/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1703612/","name":"Joby Harold"],"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Look no further than to the third entries in "The Godfather" and "The Terminator" movies. "Back To The Future III" is no exception to that rule as it clearly is the weakest part in the trilogy, but it's still one hell of a great ride.\n\nWriter/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis are two very clever men. They know the difficulties of sequels well. As Zemeckis explains somewhere on the "BTTF"-DVD set, the hardest part is to give the audience something new without moving too far away from the original's spirit. "Back To The Future II" achieved that goal gloriously (although Zemeckis who is very critical about his own work is always downsizing the greatness of it). Maybe the two Bobs went a bit too far away from what audiences loved about the original in part 3.\n\nAlthough the movie is set mainly in the Wild West, it's still seen through the eyes of two people from the 80's. There are shootouts, horse chases and train robberies, but "Back To The Future III" is never a real Western. What makes this movie seem different from its predecessors is that fittingly it doesn't have a lot to do with teen culture anymore (save for a Michael Jackson-reference). Marty himself seems to have grown up quite a bit and you'll be surprised to see him behaving more focused on his mission than Doc in the latter half of the movie. This change of places by the characters was a deliberate decision by the writers and it does push the story and the relationship of Marty and Doc forward, but something about it just doesn't feel right.\n\nIt's intriguing to learn about the origins of Hill Valley and the ancestors of the McFly-clan. However, the earnest Seamus McFly and his family - that for some reason includes a woman looking like Marty's mother - seem strangely out of place in a BTTF-movie. They're just not quirky enough. \n\nWhat makes the story seem even more estranged is the introduction of a new character, Clara Clayton, with whom Doc falls madly in love. Now, although we should all be happy for Doc having found his own private happiness, somehow we don't want him to behave like that. It's not Doc as we know and love him - and that's exactly the problem Robert Zemeckis was talking about. Marty and Doc used to be a team. Was anyone happy for John when Yoko got between him and The Beatles?\n\nI still think "Back To The Future III" is an amazing accomplishment, a fine finale to one of the best trilogies ever made. You can't give enough praise to Zemeckis and Gale for not just making these movies for financial reasons but for actually trying to make them as good as possible. Personally, I love this movie to bits and I don't think it could have been realized any better. The only explanation I got for why this brilliant sequel got a lukewarm rating of 6.7 from IMDb users, is the dilemma Zemeckis himself was aware of, but couldn't fully avoid.\n\nFans who are still longing for a fourth part should keep that in mind and would be best advised to let it go.

Look no further than to the third entries in "The Godfather" and "The Terminator" movies. "Back To The Future III" is no exception to that rule as it clearly is the weakest part in the trilogy, but it's still one hell of a great ride.\n\nWriter/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis are two very clever men. They know the difficulties of sequels well. As Zemeckis explains somewhere on the "BTTF"-DVD set, the hardest part is to give the audience something new without moving too far away from the original's spirit. "Back To The Future II" achieved that goal gloriously (although Zemeckis who is very critical about his own work is always downsizing the greatness of it). Maybe the two Bobs went a bit too far away from what audiences loved about the original in part 3.\n\nAlthough the movie is set mainly in the Wild West, it's still seen through the eyes of two people from the 80's. There are shootouts, horse chases and train robberies, but "Back To The Future III" is never a real Western. What makes this movie seem different from its predecessors is that fittingly it doesn't have a lot to do with teen culture anymore (save for a Michael Jackson-reference). Marty himself seems to have grown up quite a bit and you'll be surprised to see him behaving more focused on his mission than Doc in the latter half of the movie. This change of places by the characters was a deliberate decision by the writers and it does push the story and the relationship of Marty and Doc forward, but something about it just doesn't feel right.\n\nIt's intriguing to learn about the origins of Hill Valley and the ancestors of the McFly-clan. However, the earnest Seamus McFly and his family - that for some reason includes a woman looking like Marty's mother - seem strangely out of place in a BTTF-movie. They're just not quirky enough. \n\nWhat makes the story seem even more estranged is the introduction of a new character, Clara Clayton, with whom Doc falls madly in love. Now, although we should all be happy for Doc having found his own private happiness, somehow we don't want him to behave like that. It's not Doc as we know and love him - and that's exactly the problem Robert Zemeckis was talking about. Marty and Doc used to be a team. Was anyone happy for John when Yoko got between him and The Beatles?\n\nI still think "Back To The Future III" is an amazing accomplishment, a fine finale to one of the best trilogies ever made. You can't give enough praise to Zemeckis and Gale for not just making these movies for financial reasons but for actually trying to make them as good as possible. Personally, I love this movie to bits and I don't think it could have been realized any better. The only explanation I got for why this brilliant sequel got a lukewarm rating of 6.7 from IMDb users, is the dilemma Zemeckis himself was aware of, but couldn't fully avoid.\n\nFans who are still longing for a fourth part should keep that in mind and would be best advised to let it go. Zemeckis and Gale have said repeatedly that they don't plan on ever continuing the story. And why should they? Everything has been said, everything has been done. The movies are perfect the way they are. Let's be thankful there are still filmmakers that stick to their artistic conviction.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":422307,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1990-05-25","keywords":"year 1955,time travel,back to the future,year 1885,purple dress","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Back to the Future: The Trilogy: 25th Anniversary Trilogy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2184091929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJiZTVlMGItNzIzZS00ZThlLTk2NWMtMWQ5OGIwNmZiODliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJiZTVlMGItNzIzZS00ZThlLTk2NWMtMWQ5OGIwNmZiODliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Back to the Future: 25th Anniversary Trilogy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel. He does well - so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler. But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl; the mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agent Colin Bates. And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8423767/","name":"Patrick L.

Look no further than to the third entries in "The Godfather" and "The Terminator" movies. "Back To The Future III" is no exception to that rule as it clearly is the weakest part in the trilogy, but it's still one hell of a great ride.\n\nWriter/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis are two very clever men. They know the difficulties of sequels well. As Zemeckis explains somewhere on the "BTTF"-DVD set, the hardest part is to give the audience something new without moving too far away from the original's spirit. "Back To The Future II" achieved that goal gloriously (although Zemeckis who is very critical about his own work is always downsizing the greatness of it). Maybe the two Bobs went a bit too far away from what audiences loved about the original in part 3.\n\nAlthough the movie is set mainly in the Wild West, it's still seen through the eyes of two people from the 80's. There are shootouts, horse chases and train robberies, but "Back To The Future III" is never a real Western. What makes this movie seem different from its predecessors is that fittingly it doesn't have a lot to do with teen culture anymore (save for a Michael Jackson-reference). Marty himself seems to have grown up quite a bit and you'll be surprised to see him behaving more focused on his mission than Doc in the latter half of the movie. This change of places by the characters was a deliberate decision by the writers and it does push the story and the relationship of Marty and Doc forward, but something about it just doesn't feel right.\n\nIt's intriguing to learn about the origins of Hill Valley and the ancestors of the McFly-clan. However, the earnest Seamus McFly and his family - that for some reason includes a woman looking like Marty's mother - seem strangely out of place in a BTTF-movie. They're just not quirky enough. \n\nWhat makes the story seem even more estranged is the introduction of a new character, Clara Clayton, with whom Doc falls madly in love. Now, although we should all be happy for Doc having found his own private happiness, somehow we don't want him to behave like that. It's not Doc as we know and love him - and that's exactly the problem Robert Zemeckis was talking about. Marty and Doc used to be a team. Was anyone happy for John when Yoko got between him and The Beatles?\n\nI still think "Back To The Future III" is an amazing accomplishment, a fine finale to one of the best trilogies ever made. You can't give enough praise to Zemeckis and Gale for not just making these movies for financial reasons but for actually trying to make them as good as possible. Personally, I love this movie to bits and I don't think it could have been realized any better. The only explanation I got for why this brilliant sequel got a lukewarm rating of 6.7 from IMDb users, is the dilemma Zemeckis himself was aware of, but couldn't fully avoid.\n\nFans who are still longing for a fourth part should keep that in mind and would be best advised to let it go. Zemeckis and Gale have said repeatedly that they don't plan on ever continuing the story. And why should they? Everything has been said, everything has been done. The movies are perfect the way they are. Let's be thankful there are still filmmakers that stick to their artistic conviction.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":422307,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1990-05-25","keywords":"year 1955,time travel,back to the future,year 1885,purple dress","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Back to the Future: The Trilogy: 25th Anniversary Trilogy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2184091929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJiZTVlMGItNzIzZS00ZThlLTk2NWMtMWQ5OGIwNmZiODliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJiZTVlMGItNzIzZS00ZThlLTk2NWMtMWQ5OGIwNmZiODliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Back to the Future: 25th Anniversary Trilogy"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

If you're looking for action, save this for later. If you want to see a realistic take on space exploration and its mental implications, it's time to watch this.\n\nRealism is the keyword for this film. It doesn't try to convince the viewers with effects or stunts but rather in the way that you could for a brief while really feel you're in space. The director, Eric Hayden's father has been working on the Galileo probe that went to Jupiter which probably had its contribution to this film's script. The whole design of the ship and the mission is very realistic and it'd be quite close to the actual way we would go to Europa if we ever would.\n\nWithout going into spoilers, there is another level going on in the film. More human. Again the characters are realistic and they act like a well trained astronauts would. But as the events unfold, the mental evolution of the main character becomes analogous with the craft's journey both in space and fate.\n\nThere's a hint of third level on the movie which probably means I have to watch this movie again. It's not just the craft or the man inside who's making the journey but us, as human beings collectively.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-06-16","keywords":"accident,low budget sci fi movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Push","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735054105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A science fiction art film about an adventurous mission to Jupiter's moon that is cut short when disaster strikes, killing the co-pilot.

If you want to see a realistic take on space exploration and its mental implications, it's time to watch this.\n\nRealism is the keyword for this film. It doesn't try to convince the viewers with effects or stunts but rather in the way that you could for a brief while really feel you're in space. The director, Eric Hayden's father has been working on the Galileo probe that went to Jupiter which probably had its contribution to this film's script. The whole design of the ship and the mission is very realistic and it'd be quite close to the actual way we would go to Europa if we ever would.\n\nWithout going into spoilers, there is another level going on in the film. More human. Again the characters are realistic and they act like a well trained astronauts would. But as the events unfold, the mental evolution of the main character becomes analogous with the craft's journey both in space and fate.\n\nThere's a hint of third level on the movie which probably means I have to watch this movie again. It's not just the craft or the man inside who's making the journey but us, as human beings collectively.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-06-16","keywords":"accident,low budget sci fi movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Push","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735054105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A science fiction art film about an adventurous mission to Jupiter's moon that is cut short when disaster strikes, killing the co-pilot.

Die weiblichen Oberhäupter des Planeten bereiten der Crew einen eher frostigen Empfang, doch wenigstens findet die Crew Überlebende der Frachterbesatzung. Diese haben sich mit Frauen des Planeten vermählt. Auf der Enterprise richtet derweil ein Virus aus einer Holodeck-Datei großen Schaden an und die Sternenflotte fordert einen Bericht über die Sichtung eines romulanischen Schiffs nahe der Neutralen Zone.</desc>

The first episode sets the stage for this 18 episode series. After the Russians capture a German spy by the name of Hans Kloss, they spend a great deal of time interrogating him about the smallest details of his life. The German spy is replaced with a Polish look-a-like named Janek (Stanislaw Mikulski), and his "escape" is staged to have several German witnesses that will confirm his identity as a German officer. Hans Kloss provides intelligence and assistance to other spies he is aligned with and, more significantly, creates an environment in which the Germans are all suspecting each other of being a traitor, thus crushing their morale.\n\nHans Kloss gets himself into countless sticky situations, which nearly take a miracle to untangle from. Each episode has mystery and keeps one guessing how it will turn out until the very end. Although there is no major carryover in the storyline between each episode, there are more than a number of small details that find their way into the next installments.\n\nThe entire story takes place from 1943 to 1945, and we see Germany at its height of power to its gradual fall. The part that I found especially interesting are the final days of the war, when the tables were turned and the days of the Germany's power where numbered. The fear they inspired in others is now something they had to deal with themselves. I also found it interesting that it showed some of the German officers were positioning themselves to look favorable with the Americans hoping to find a haven with them (which has been confirmed a number of times with declassified information but isn't widely known).\n\nMore than Life at Stake is a classic Polish television show that has remained popular since its creation in 1967-1968 (and probably will for many years in the future). The episodes are alternately directed by Andrzej Konic or Janusz Morgenstern. Hans Kloss is a cultural icon that is probably just as popular as Czterej pancerni i pies, which was also made in the late 1960s. Furthermore, even though Stawka wieksza niz zycie was made during the period of Soviet occupation of Poland, there is less pro-communist sentiment than Czterej pancerni i pies and even portrays the AK favorably. More than Life at Stake is an exceptional WWII serial, particularly for those who like the espionage side to the story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"1968-10-10","keywords":"nazi,spy,cult,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586725/","name":"Stanislaw Mikulski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439202/","name":"Emil Karewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668037/","name":"Bronislaw Pawlik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098526/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first episode sets the stage for this 18 episode series. After the Russians capture a German spy by the name of Hans Kloss, they spend a great deal of time interrogating him about the smallest details of his life. The German spy is replaced with a Polish look-a-like named Janek (Stanislaw Mikulski), and his "escape" is staged to have several German witnesses that will confirm his identity as a German officer. Hans Kloss provides intelligence and assistance to other spies he is aligned with and, more significantly, creates an environment in which the Germans are all suspecting each other of being a traitor, thus crushing their morale.\n\nHans Kloss gets himself into countless sticky situations, which nearly take a miracle to untangle from. Each episode has mystery and keeps one guessing how it will turn out until the very end. Although there is no major carryover in the storyline between each episode, there are more than a number of small details that find their way into the next installments.\n\nThe entire story takes place from 1943 to 1945, and we see Germany at its height of power to its gradual fall. The part that I found especially interesting are the final days of the war, when the tables were turned and the days of the Germany's power where numbered. The fear they inspired in others is now something they had to deal with themselves. I also found it interesting that it showed some of the German officers were positioning themselves to look favorable with the Americans hoping to find a haven with them (which has been confirmed a number of times with declassified information but isn't widely known).\n\nMore than Life at Stake is a classic Polish television show that has remained popular since its creation in 1967-1968 (and probably will for many years in the future). The episodes are alternately directed by Andrzej Konic or Janusz Morgenstern. Hans Kloss is a cultural icon that is probably just as popular as Czterej pancerni i pies, which was also made in the late 1960s. Furthermore, even though Stawka wieksza niz zycie was made during the period of Soviet occupation of Poland, there is less pro-communist sentiment than Czterej pancerni i pies and even portrays the AK favorably. More than Life at Stake is an exceptional WWII serial, particularly for those who like the espionage side to the story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"1968-10-10","keywords":"nazi,spy,cult,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586725/","name":"Stanislaw Mikulski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439202/","name":"Emil Karewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668037/","name":"Bronislaw Pawlik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098526/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
