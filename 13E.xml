It was written and directed by Michal Rosa.\n\nThe movie is set in 1939 in an apartment house in Silesia--an area of Poland close to the German border. The apartment house itself is unusual. It's clearly not far from a city, but it sits in lonely isolation in a field. It's a very upscale place, and most of the people who live in it are middle or upper class. It's not what we in the U.S. would call a tenement, with poor people making ends meet. It's very elegant.\n\nThe plot centers around a journalist from a large city who is sent to the area to track down an elusive bestselling author. This search is more or less just a way to begin the story. When the reporter arrives, his first meeting is with the beautiful Róza, portrayed by Karolina Gruszka. \n\nRóza has many charms, which she openly displays to the reporter, as well as to any other man who joins her. In turn, director Rosa openly displays Gruszka's charms to his audience. We can all see why she's called "The Happiness of the World."\n\nThe movie plot is actually a series of vignettes. Each inhabitant of the apartment building has her or his own story. To a certain extent, the stories intersect, because all of the characters live in the same place. The pivotal figure in all of this is Róza. Karolina Gruszka isn't just another pretty face. She's an extraordinary actor, who is well known in Poland. The movie will rise or fall depending on Gruszka's presence on the screen. She's great, and the film rises accordingly.\n\nWe watched this movie in Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work well on the small screen. The film was shown at the outstanding 2017 Rochester Polish Film Festival. After the film, director Rosa was in attendance for a Q&amp;A session. (He doesn't speak English, but the interpreter who worked with him was superb.) My compliments to the PFF for bringing the director to Rochester.\n\nFor me, the most striking aspect of the Q&amp;A was Mr. Rosa's discussion of magical realism. I believe that everyone in the audience noted magical realism in the movie. Director Rosa says that it isn't magical realism--it's just realism. I'm not sure if he was joking with us when he said that, or whether he actually believes that the type of events he shows us aren't magical at all. You'll have to watch the movie to see what you think about this realism.\n\nP.S. The Happiness of the World has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.3. It's a much, much better movie than that. Again, you'll have to watch the movie and then decide for yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-12-23","keywords":"silesia,bathtub,femme fatale","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344734/","name":"Karolina Gruszka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8475166/","name":"Mateusz Lickindorf"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2707614/","name":"Grzegorz Palkowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577510/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, rather than a 1:1 adaptation, the film is built upon a fascinating structural conceit - although it tells the same story as Segher's novel, it is set in the here and now. At least, some elements are set in the here and now. In fact, only part of the film's milieu is modern. So, although such things as cars, ships, weaponry, and police uniforms are all contemporary, there are no mobile phones, no computers, people still use typewriters and send letters, and the clothes worn by the characters are the same as would have been worn at the time. In essence, this means that the film is set neither entirely in 1942 nor entirely in 2019, but in a strange kind of temporal halfway-house, borrowing elements from each. There's a fairly obvious reason that writer/director Christian Petzold employs this strategy, and it has to be said, it works exceptionally well, with the film's thematic focus symbiotically intertwined with its aesthetic to a highly unusual degree. Petzold doesn't so much suggest that history is repeating itself, as postulate that there's no difference between then and now. Unfortunately, aside from this daring aesthetic gambit, not much else worked for me, with the plot somnolent and the characters void of any relatable emotion.\n\nThe film tells the story of Georg (Franz Rogowski) a young man on the run from the "fascists". In Paris, he's entrusted with delivering some papers to George Weidel, a communist author currently in the city. However, when Georg goes to Weidel's hotel room, he finds the writer has committed suicide. Taking an unpublished manuscript, two letters from Weidel to his wife Marie, and Weidel's transit visa for passage to Mexico, Georg stows away on a train heading for Marseilles, one of the few European ports not yet under fascist control. Upon arriving, Georg visits the wife of a friend who died, Melissa (Maryam Zaree), to give her the bad news. However, she's deaf, and he has to explain the death through her young son, Driss (Lilien Batman), with whom he quickly forms a bond. Meanwhile, when he goes to the Mexican consulate to return Weidel's belongings, he is mistaken for Weidel himself, and he realises he has a chance to escape Europe, with Weidel booked on a ship sailing in a few days. As Georg awaits passage, he has several encounters with a mysterious woman, who, it is soon revealed is none other than Marie Weidel (Paula Beer), who is waiting for word from her husband. Not telling her that Weidel is dead, Georg finds himself falling for her.\n\nShot on location in Paris and Marseilles, everything from street signs to cars (including a few electric ones) to the front of buildings is modern, whilst Hans Fromm's crisp digital photography hasn't been aged in any way whatsoever. In terms of cultural signifiers, Petzold keeps it vague, although there is a reference to Dawn of the Dead (1978), with the closing credits featuring "Road to Nowhere" (1982). However, for everything that seems to locate the film in the 21st century, there's something to locate it in the 1940s, whether it be the absence of mobile phones, computers, and the internet, or the ubiquity of typewriters and letters. Along the same lines, Petzold keeps the politics generalised, with no mention of Nazis, concentration camps, or the Holocaust. Instead, the film makes reference to archetypal "fascists", never-defined "camps", and systemic "cleansing".\n\nThe combination of liminal elements of modernity and period-specific history sets up a temporal/cognitive dissonance which forces the audience to move beyond the abstract notion that what once happened could happen again. Instead, we are made to recognise that the difference between past and present is a semantic distinction only, and that that which once happened never really stopped happening. Indeed, given the resurgence of Neo-Fascism across Europe, built primarily on irrational xenophobic fears of the Other in the form of immigration, the refugee crisis is as bad today as it ever was in the 40s. The temporal dislocation also suggests both the specificity and the universality of the refugee experience - every refugee is fundamentally unique, but so too is the experience the same.\n\nThe other important aesthetic choice is the use of a very unusual voiceover narration. Introduced out of the blue as Georg begins reading Weidel's manuscript at around the 20-minute mark, there's no initial indication as to the narrator's identity or when the narration is taking place. Additionally, the narrator is unreliable, as on occasion he describes something differently to how we see it. The narration also "interacts" with the dialogue at one point - in a scene between Georg and Marie, their dialogue alternates with the VO; they get one part of a sentence and the VO completes it, or vice versa.\n\nHowever, although I really liked the temporal dissonance, the experimental VO didn't work nearly as well, serving primarily to pull you out of the film as you try to answer a myriad of questions - where and when is the voice is coming from; what is its relationship to the narrative; are we hearing a character speak or someone outside the fabula; how can the narrator have access to Georg's innermost thoughts at some points but not at others; why is the voice able to accurately describe things not seen by Georg, but often inaccurately describe things which are; why does the narration seem to be ahead of the narrative at some points, and behind it at others; what is the purpose of the pseudo-break of the fourth wall by having the VO alternate with dialogue? I don't have answers to all of these questions, but I think the point of the destabilising/defamiliarising narration is to reinforce the experience of being a refugee, which is a mass of stories within stories and fragments that often contradict one another.\n\nThe film has more problems than just the VO, however. To suggest the disenfranchised nature of what it is to be a refugee, Petzold depicts Georg as a non-person; he has very little agency and is instead someone to whom things happen. In short, he's passive, less a protagonist than a witness. Passive characters can work extremely well in the right circumstances (think of Chance Gardner (Peter Sellers) in Being There (1979), or the most famous example, Hamlet), but here, passivity combines with a dearth of backstory and character development, whilst Rogowski plays the part without a hint of interiority. Easily the most successful scenes in the film are those showing his friendship with Driss because they're the only moments where he seems like a person rather than a narrative construct, they're the only parts of the film that ring emotionally true.\n\nThis friendship, however, is secondary to the love story between Georg and Marie. Except that it isn't a love story; there's no emotional realism to it whatsoever. I understand what Petzold is going for here. He doesn't want a Hollywood love story of fireworks and poetic monologues, he wants to show that the war and their status as refugees has stripped them of their identities, and they are now effectively shells. However, this in no way necessitates such a badly written relationship void of emotional truth.\n\nWhat Petzold is trying to do in his characterisation of Georg is clear enough; as an archetypal refugee, Georg can't be seen to have much control over his affairs, and his time in Marseille must be static, an existence in-between more fully realised states. Petzold uses this to try to imply that to be divested of one's country is to be divested of one's identity. However, the extent of his passivity renders him completely unrealistic - he's not a person, he's a robot.\n\nTied to this is a lack of forward narrative momentum. Again, I understand that Petzold is trying to stay true to the experience, that the life of a refugee must necessarily involve a lot of waiting, repetition, and frustration. But again, it's the extent to which the film goes to suggest this. Yes, inertia is part of the theme insofar as the film depicts people suffering from crippling inertia, but it doesn't necessarily follow that the film needs to be so unrelentingly dull.\n\nEasily the most egregious problem is one that arises from a combination of these issues - it's impossible to care about any of the characters. Think of films as varied as Das Boot ist voll (1981), Le Havre (2011), or Toivon tuolla puolen (2017). All depict refugees, and all ring true emotionally, because they're populated by characters about whom we come to care. This is precisely what Transit is lacking. There is no pathos, with none of the characters coming across as anything but a cipher, a representative archetype onto which Petzold can project his thematic concerns. With little in the way of psychological verisimilitude or interiority, they simply never come alive as real people.\n\nAn intellectual film rather than an emotional one, Transit is cold and distant. And this coldness and distance has a cumulative effect, with the film eventually outlasting my patience. The temporal dissonance works extremely well, but it's really all the film has going for it. Petzold says some interesting things regarding the experience of refugees in the 21st century vis-à-vis refugees of World War II, and the mirror he holds up to our society isn't especially flattering. If only we could care about someone on screen. Anyone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9643,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-04-05","keywords":"refugee,marseille france,voice over narration,assumed identity,assuming identity of a dead person","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Transit - Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi209500697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As fascism spreads, German refugee Georg (Franz Rogowski) flees to Marseille and assumes the identity of the dead writer whose transit papers he is carrying.

As Georg awaits passage, he has several encounters with a mysterious woman, who, it is soon revealed is none other than Marie Weidel (Paula Beer), who is waiting for word from her husband. Not telling her that Weidel is dead, Georg finds himself falling for her.\n\nShot on location in Paris and Marseilles, everything from street signs to cars (including a few electric ones) to the front of buildings is modern, whilst Hans Fromm's crisp digital photography hasn't been aged in any way whatsoever. In terms of cultural signifiers, Petzold keeps it vague, although there is a reference to Dawn of the Dead (1978), with the closing credits featuring "Road to Nowhere" (1982). However, for everything that seems to locate the film in the 21st century, there's something to locate it in the 1940s, whether it be the absence of mobile phones, computers, and the internet, or the ubiquity of typewriters and letters. Along the same lines, Petzold keeps the politics generalised, with no mention of Nazis, concentration camps, or the Holocaust. Instead, the film makes reference to archetypal "fascists", never-defined "camps", and systemic "cleansing".\n\nThe combination of liminal elements of modernity and period-specific history sets up a temporal/cognitive dissonance which forces the audience to move beyond the abstract notion that what once happened could happen again. Instead, we are made to recognise that the difference between past and present is a semantic distinction only, and that that which once happened never really stopped happening. Indeed, given the resurgence of Neo-Fascism across Europe, built primarily on irrational xenophobic fears of the Other in the form of immigration, the refugee crisis is as bad today as it ever was in the 40s. The temporal dislocation also suggests both the specificity and the universality of the refugee experience - every refugee is fundamentally unique, but so too is the experience the same.\n\nThe other important aesthetic choice is the use of a very unusual voiceover narration. Introduced out of the blue as Georg begins reading Weidel's manuscript at around the 20-minute mark, there's no initial indication as to the narrator's identity or when the narration is taking place. Additionally, the narrator is unreliable, as on occasion he describes something differently to how we see it. The narration also "interacts" with the dialogue at one point - in a scene between Georg and Marie, their dialogue alternates with the VO; they get one part of a sentence and the VO completes it, or vice versa.\n\nHowever, although I really liked the temporal dissonance, the experimental VO didn't work nearly as well, serving primarily to pull you out of the film as you try to answer a myriad of questions - where and when is the voice is coming from; what is its relationship to the narrative; are we hearing a character speak or someone outside the fabula; how can the narrator have access to Georg's innermost thoughts at some points but not at others; why is the voice able to accurately describe things not seen by Georg, but often inaccurately describe things which are; why does the narration seem to be ahead of the narrative at some points, and behind it at others; what is the purpose of the pseudo-break of the fourth wall by having the VO alternate with dialogue? I don't have answers to all of these questions, but I think the point of the destabilising/defamiliarising narration is to reinforce the experience of being a refugee, which is a mass of stories within stories and fragments that often contradict one another.\n\nThe film has more problems than just the VO, however. To suggest the disenfranchised nature of what it is to be a refugee, Petzold depicts Georg as a non-person; he has very little agency and is instead someone to whom things happen. In short, he's passive, less a protagonist than a witness. Passive characters can work extremely well in the right circumstances (think of Chance Gardner (Peter Sellers) in Being There (1979), or the most famous example, Hamlet), but here, passivity combines with a dearth of backstory and character development, whilst Rogowski plays the part without a hint of interiority. Easily the most successful scenes in the film are those showing his friendship with Driss because they're the only moments where he seems like a person rather than a narrative construct, they're the only parts of the film that ring emotionally true.\n\nThis friendship, however, is secondary to the love story between Georg and Marie. Except that it isn't a love story; there's no emotional realism to it whatsoever. I understand what Petzold is going for here. He doesn't want a Hollywood love story of fireworks and poetic monologues, he wants to show that the war and their status as refugees has stripped them of their identities, and they are now effectively shells. However, this in no way necessitates such a badly written relationship void of emotional truth.\n\nWhat Petzold is trying to do in his characterisation of Georg is clear enough; as an archetypal refugee, Georg can't be seen to have much control over his affairs, and his time in Marseille must be static, an existence in-between more fully realised states. Petzold uses this to try to imply that to be divested of one's country is to be divested of one's identity. However, the extent of his passivity renders him completely unrealistic - he's not a person, he's a robot.\n\nTied to this is a lack of forward narrative momentum. Again, I understand that Petzold is trying to stay true to the experience, that the life of a refugee must necessarily involve a lot of waiting, repetition, and frustration. But again, it's the extent to which the film goes to suggest this. Yes, inertia is part of the theme insofar as the film depicts people suffering from crippling inertia, but it doesn't necessarily follow that the film needs to be so unrelentingly dull.\n\nEasily the most egregious problem is one that arises from a combination of these issues - it's impossible to care about any of the characters. Think of films as varied as Das Boot ist voll (1981), Le Havre (2011), or Toivon tuolla puolen (2017). All depict refugees, and all ring true emotionally, because they're populated by characters about whom we come to care. This is precisely what Transit is lacking. There is no pathos, with none of the characters coming across as anything but a cipher, a representative archetype onto which Petzold can project his thematic concerns. With little in the way of psychological verisimilitude or interiority, they simply never come alive as real people.\n\nAn intellectual film rather than an emotional one, Transit is cold and distant. And this coldness and distance has a cumulative effect, with the film eventually outlasting my patience. The temporal dissonance works extremely well, but it's really all the film has going for it. Petzold says some interesting things regarding the experience of refugees in the 21st century vis-à-vis refugees of World War II, and the mirror he holds up to our society isn't especially flattering. If only we could care about someone on screen. Anyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9643,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-04-05","keywords":"refugee,marseille france,voice over narration,assumed identity,assuming identity of a dead person","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Transit - Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi209500697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As fascism spreads, German refugee Georg (Franz Rogowski) flees to Marseille and assumes the identity of the dead writer whose transit papers he is carrying.

Director Derek Cianfrance's third feature is the follow-up to 2010's widely praised Blue Valentine, a movie whose supposed magnificence was lost on me. Cianfrance reteams with one of that film's stars, Ryan Gosling, for one of The Place Beyond The Pines' three segments that unfolds over a 15 year period with interconnected story lines that mixes elements of crime drama, teenage angst, questions about fate, and the complexities of father-son relationships.\n\nThe first segment is unquestionably the film's strongest, with Gosling further refining the brooding anti-hero character that seems to have become his stock-in- trade. His Luke character is introduced in the film's great opening scene that employs an extensive single tracking shot, as the audience views his heavily tattooed body and carnival motorcycle stunt rider profession, which convey Luke's societal fringe elements without saying a word. Luke's white trash status is also reinforced by the repeated wearing of a Metallica Ride The Lightning muscle tee and a ratty white t-shirt worn inside out in public, tag and all (I love that the latter is never addressed by any characters Luke meets). A reconnection with a woman (Romina, played by a solid Eva Mendes) he had a quickie fling with the last time his job brought him to town reveals that he's the father of her two-year old son. The news awakens Luke's paternal instincts and he attempts to insert himself back into the pair's lives, despite the complication of another man in Romina's life. Desperate to prove he can provide for Romina and his son, Luke ends up robbing banks, with the assistance of a scruffy auto mechanic he's met (an excellent Ben Mendelsohn providing some understated comic relief). Aspects of Luke and his deeds immediately bring to mind Gosling's role from last year's Drive. Despite the similarities in roles surprisingly played so close to each other, Gosling's unpredictable, violence-prone character commands the screen for the approximately hour long length of his segment. His storyline does admittedly benefit from the best writing of the three segments, courtesy of screenwriters Cianfrance, Ben Coccio, and Darius Marder.\n\nGosling's dynamism and that first segment's brilliance are only highlighted by the significantly diminishing returns that follow it. Segment two stars Bradley Cooper as a rookie cop who found himself involved in Luke's story, with other subplots involving police corruption, morality, and an unhappy marriage also playing out. I've always found Cooper to be a rather dull actor and his performance here hasn't changed my opinion; that, combined with the segment's derivative story, managed to effectively kill my segment one buzz. The writing is also too uneven - Cooper's character is set up as a smart, moral person, yet those qualities are a little too conveniently discarded when he's presented with a career-altering decision. Bruce Greenwood is memorable in a small role as a high-ranking cop, while Ray Liotta's minor role as an intimidating, crooked cop feels like the kind of role we've seen from him dozens of times already.\n\nSegment three completes The Place Beyond The Pines' downhill slide, focussing on the teenage sons (played by Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen) of Gosling's and Cooper's characters. As the snoozy storyline featuring bratty behaviour from the screwed up high school students developed, I could never get past the fact the segment hinged on their chance meeting and eventual friendship. That meeting, considering the inextricably linked history they share via their fathers, was simply far too coincidental for me to suspend disbelief. Also distracting: a time jump of 15 years reveals Cooper's character and that of his wife (played by Rose Byrne) to have seemingly not aged at all, while Mendes' Romina looks to have aged about 25 years.\n\nI respect the fact that Cianfrance took some risks with The Place Beyond The Pines, which had its world premiere at TIFF - he throws in a major plot twist relatively early on and the movie's segmented structure is definitely a gamble and somewhat unconventional, but unfortunately, the loosely connected narrative and performances don't hold together over the course of the film's too-long 140 minute running time. The disappointing ending shouldn't come as much of a shock to anyone who has just witnessed the decline from the first-rate quality of the riveting opening segment to the progressively inferior chapters that follow. As the last third of it plays out, that swing has been so dramatic that it almost feels like we're watching an altogether different movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258851,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"bank robbery,neo noir,original story,bank,high school student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi267494937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.

Director Derek Cianfrance's third feature is the follow-up to 2010's widely praised Blue Valentine, a movie whose supposed magnificence was lost on me. Cianfrance reteams with one of that film's stars, Ryan Gosling, for one of The Place Beyond The Pines' three segments that unfolds over a 15 year period with interconnected story lines that mixes elements of crime drama, teenage angst, questions about fate, and the complexities of father-son relationships.\n\nThe first segment is unquestionably the film's strongest, with Gosling further refining the brooding anti-hero character that seems to have become his stock-in- trade. His Luke character is introduced in the film's great opening scene that employs an extensive single tracking shot, as the audience views his heavily tattooed body and carnival motorcycle stunt rider profession, which convey Luke's societal fringe elements without saying a word. Luke's white trash status is also reinforced by the repeated wearing of a Metallica Ride The Lightning muscle tee and a ratty white t-shirt worn inside out in public, tag and all (I love that the latter is never addressed by any characters Luke meets). A reconnection with a woman (Romina, played by a solid Eva Mendes) he had a quickie fling with the last time his job brought him to town reveals that he's the father of her two-year old son. The news awakens Luke's paternal instincts and he attempts to insert himself back into the pair's lives, despite the complication of another man in Romina's life. Desperate to prove he can provide for Romina and his son, Luke ends up robbing banks, with the assistance of a scruffy auto mechanic he's met (an excellent Ben Mendelsohn providing some understated comic relief). Aspects of Luke and his deeds immediately bring to mind Gosling's role from last year's Drive. Despite the similarities in roles surprisingly played so close to each other, Gosling's unpredictable, violence-prone character commands the screen for the approximately hour long length of his segment. His storyline does admittedly benefit from the best writing of the three segments, courtesy of screenwriters Cianfrance, Ben Coccio, and Darius Marder.\n\nGosling's dynamism and that first segment's brilliance are only highlighted by the significantly diminishing returns that follow it. Segment two stars Bradley Cooper as a rookie cop who found himself involved in Luke's story, with other subplots involving police corruption, morality, and an unhappy marriage also playing out. I've always found Cooper to be a rather dull actor and his performance here hasn't changed my opinion; that, combined with the segment's derivative story, managed to effectively kill my segment one buzz. The writing is also too uneven - Cooper's character is set up as a smart, moral person, yet those qualities are a little too conveniently discarded when he's presented with a career-altering decision. Bruce Greenwood is memorable in a small role as a high-ranking cop, while Ray Liotta's minor role as an intimidating, crooked cop feels like the kind of role we've seen from him dozens of times already.\n\nSegment three completes The Place Beyond The Pines' downhill slide, focussing on the teenage sons (played by Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen) of Gosling's and Cooper's characters. As the snoozy storyline featuring bratty behaviour from the screwed up high school students developed, I could never get past the fact the segment hinged on their chance meeting and eventual friendship. That meeting, considering the inextricably linked history they share via their fathers, was simply far too coincidental for me to suspend disbelief. Also distracting: a time jump of 15 years reveals Cooper's character and that of his wife (played by Rose Byrne) to have seemingly not aged at all, while Mendes' Romina looks to have aged about 25 years.\n\nI respect the fact that Cianfrance took some risks with The Place Beyond The Pines, which had its world premiere at TIFF - he throws in a major plot twist relatively early on and the movie's segmented structure is definitely a gamble and somewhat unconventional, but unfortunately, the loosely connected narrative and performances don't hold together over the course of the film's too-long 140 minute running time. The disappointing ending shouldn't come as much of a shock to anyone who has just witnessed the decline from the first-rate quality of the riveting opening segment to the progressively inferior chapters that follow. As the last third of it plays out, that swing has been so dramatic that it almost feels like we're watching an altogether different movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258851,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"bank robbery,neo noir,original story,bank,high school student","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi267494937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.

Good movies. The family that is at the center of the Danish film 'Dronningen' or 'Queen of Hearts' is in many ways similar to one of the two families in the Korean film 'Parasite'. It's a wealthy family that lives in a luxurious villa, surrounded by rich vegetation that will play a role in the story and atmosphere of the film. In the two floors villa, designed and furnished according to all the rules of the Scandinavian design, the family of the family of doctor Peter and his wife Anne, a lawyer specializing in crime and teenage abuse cases, lives an apparently happy and quiet life together with their twin girls who have a childhood sprinkled with riding lessons and readings from Lewis Carroll. The balance of the quiet happy family life will be broken by the appearance of the disturbing element represented in this film by Gustav, Peter's son from a previous marriage, a young man just out of adolescence, with some problems and resentments for the early exit of the father from his early life.\n\nI will refrain from telling more of the story of the film, as the action evolves gradually, with many surprising turns both in what happens on screen but especially in the psychology of the characters. As with 'Parasite', we will have trouble trying to fit this film into a cinematic genre. It is a family drama combined with a story about coming of age, an intrigue of love and passion with extreme eroticism, a strong social commentary on the appearances of bourgeois life in the age of political correctness and the apparent protection of troubled youth, and a psychological thriller. Everything is filmed flawlessly, in an elegant and aseptic setting surrounded by an eternally picturesque nature. The film aesthetics makes the brutality of some of the relationships and the action of the characters that we are witnessing appear even more shocking. The film seems to continue in the 21st century the themes of some of Ingmar Bergman's films, with a frankness and brutality that reminded me of Michael Haneke.\n\nIt's almost unbelievable that this is only the second film of director May el-Toukhy. 'Queen of Hearts' (for which she is also a screenwriter) is a well-written, smartly constructed, beautifully filmed and impeccably played movie. A film that adds to my recommendations in a cinematic season blessed with many interesting films that challenge the minds and hearts of quality movies fans.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"NC-17","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-28","keywords":"stepmother stepson relationship,stepmother stepson sex,unfaithful wife,infidelity,sex with stepmother","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Festival Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3607214617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVlNDRlMTQtMTQwOC00M2Y5LTgzM2ItYzZmZGRmNWYzZjk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVlNDRlMTQtMTQwOC00M2Y5LTgzM2ItYzZmZGRmNWYzZjk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A successful lawyer jeopardizes her family and career when she seduces her teenage stepson."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245988/","name":"Trine Dyrholm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6625833/","name":"Gustav Lindh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470886/","name":"Magnus Krepper"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1392439/","name":"May el-Toukhy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095264/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048411/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048118/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477622/","name":"Maren Louise Käehne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1392439/","name":"May el-Toukhy"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That and that it was another film seen as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible were my main reasons in seeing 'Under the Tree' from Icelandic director Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson. \n\n'Under the Tree' is a truly fine film and manages to take a relevant subject (feuding neighbours) and explore it in a way that was hilarious, shocking and moving. It won't be one of my favourite films any time soon, but in no way should it be overlooked and should be seen as an example of how to execute a film with a subject like this well. Sadly, 'Under the Tree' has been released here alongside more expensive in budget films that have been quite big box office successes and films that people are more likely to go and see. While having enjoyed many of the films in question (in no way is it intended to be knock), 'Under the Tree' is better than most of them and deserves better.\n\nSure 'Under the Tree' is occasionally a touch overcooked and some may find some of the behaviours extreme. \n\nHowever, Sigurdsson directs with a perfect balance of hilarious mayhem and melancholic pathos. This is also reflected in the thought-provoking script he scripted with Huldar Breidfjord. Many parts are hilarious in a dark way, others genuinely shock and there are emotional parts too, all in a way that is kept plausible throughout. Neighbour feuding sounds insignificant on paper to some, but 'Under the Tree' makes it darkly funny, disturbing and melancholic, a not easy feat but beautifully done here.\n\nThe storytelling is always compelling, with the tensions having a bleakness and ferocity while still entertaining and emotionally resonating. There is a good deal happening, but not in a way that it feels cluttered with too many characters and subplots, instead there is enough breathing space and depth while having an alertness to the drama. \n\nA good cast would be needed to bring all this life.

That and that it was another film seen as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible were my main reasons in seeing 'Under the Tree' from Icelandic director Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson. \n\n'Under the Tree' is a truly fine film and manages to take a relevant subject (feuding neighbours) and explore it in a way that was hilarious, shocking and moving. It won't be one of my favourite films any time soon, but in no way should it be overlooked and should be seen as an example of how to execute a film with a subject like this well. Sadly, 'Under the Tree' has been released here alongside more expensive in budget films that have been quite big box office successes and films that people are more likely to go and see. While having enjoyed many of the films in question (in no way is it intended to be knock), 'Under the Tree' is better than most of them and deserves better.\n\nSure 'Under the Tree' is occasionally a touch overcooked and some may find some of the behaviours extreme. \n\nHowever, Sigurdsson directs with a perfect balance of hilarious mayhem and melancholic pathos. This is also reflected in the thought-provoking script he scripted with Huldar Breidfjord. Many parts are hilarious in a dark way, others genuinely shock and there are emotional parts too, all in a way that is kept plausible throughout. Neighbour feuding sounds insignificant on paper to some, but 'Under the Tree' makes it darkly funny, disturbing and melancholic, a not easy feat but beautifully done here.\n\nThe storytelling is always compelling, with the tensions having a bleakness and ferocity while still entertaining and emotionally resonating. There is a good deal happening, but not in a way that it feels cluttered with too many characters and subplots, instead there is enough breathing space and depth while having an alertness to the drama. \n\nA good cast would be needed to bring all this life. Luckily, 'Under the Tree's' cast is excellent. Particularly note-worthy of a cast where everybody is good and nobody bad is Edda Bjorgvinsdottir on fiercely intense form, her character near-unhinged. \n\nIt is a very well made film visually, beautifully shot in particular. The music is inspired, appropriate and cleverly used.\n\nOverall, great and shouldn't be forgotten. 9/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4499,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-09-06","keywords":"tree,revenge,sex scene,husband wife relationship,next door neighbor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1409204505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwODVjOWYtZjcyNi00MzkzLWI5MjYtNTVmMjlmYzMxMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwODVjOWYtZjcyNi00MzkzLWI5MjYtNTVmMjlmYzMxMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2621096/","name":"Steinþór Hróar Steinþórsson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084908/","name":"Edda Björgvinsdóttir","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797610/","name":"Sigurður Sigurjónsson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2619779/","name":"Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0464992/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048411/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458057/","name":"Huldar Breiðfjörð","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2619779/","name":"Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the scene, where the underground partisan, Sophia, brings Sgt. Beckett beneath a tavern, to a store of WWII arms. Sgt. Beckett picks up a rifle and calling it a German 8mm Mauser. But in reality it is a Russian 7.62 Mosin Nagant, to which he adds the proper Russian sniper scope and mount. I was very surprised at this and wonder who was at fault. But otherwise, I felt this film is another success for Tom Berenger.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6057,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"2002-12-25","keywords":"second part,part two,camouflage,reference to slobodan milosevic,reference to guantanamo bay cuba","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000297/","name":"Tom Berenger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0940158/","name":"Bokeem Woodbine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549629/","name":"Erika Marozsán"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0062644/","name":"Craig R.

There's a well developed world, and its unique to the premise, and the visuals are no doubt inspired in part by baroque and renaissance art. Its actually quite different from Legion, though it takes place around 2 decades after the events in the movie, it explores a lot more and humanizes the villains and their motivations. I actually like dominion more than the movie because it paints the "8 balls" as they've come to be called, as more than monsters.\n\nBasically the premise is, the archangel Gabriel led the host of lower angels in a war against humanity, basically blaming them for god leaving, just like Lucifer did millennia before, and Michael was the only angel to stand against them and defend humanity, helping to found the city of Vega and protect them from the possessed humans, who basically destroy most of the world, minus a few well protected cities. His solution isn't perfect, and what was meant to be a temporary caste system ends up in a full blown economic segregation leaving the ultra rich living in luxury, with the poor and abandoned living in squalor beneath. Over the years word has spread about a "chosen one" who will save mankind and end the war, with some believers, and some believing it is nothing more than a fantasy. Enter the main character, who grows up a penniless orphan, enlisting in the military just to have something to eat, who finds out he is the child they had spoken of. And then there's the higher ranks of angels who don't have black eyes, and sometimes bear wings, who up until that point hadn't been forced to pick a side.\n\nThere's definitely some movie clichés in there, but they play out in a way thats somewhat new and interesting, and touch on some topics that haven't been covered. One of the things that i like about this series is the main antagonist is a part of the ruling bureaucracy, and despite being your cliché diabolical politician, everyone basically sees through his bullshit already and tells him to cut the crap whenever he starts spouting off some lies or blackmail. Its a nice change of pace to see characters who aren't stupid and overly trusting. On the other hand, i wish there was a bit more skewed logic behind gabriel's assertion "its humanities fault god left". You'd expect a bit more from a once near omniscient being thats thousands of years old. Maybe some overly complex overthought justification, nothing near that simple and small minded. At any rate i think the directors can take some hints from the show supernatural, which at some points bears a similar premise, because they've got the angel mindset down to a science already. But its nice to see they're taking it in a different direction, and i'd be curious to see if Gabriel has any plans to release Lucifer from the pit to fight along side him. It'd certainly be in his favor.\n\nAll in all, its pretty good. The cinematography is probably the best part about this show, its very deep, saturated, elegant and classical. The opening titles especially reflect the theme, that this show might be something you'd see through the frame of a renaissance painting, rather than something of the modern age.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23327,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2014-06-19","keywords":"archangel,soldier,infidelity,foursome,orgy","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0250659/","name":"Christopher Egan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936300/","name":"Tom Wisdom"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1861467/","name":"Roxanne McKee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0135575/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086397/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2477757/","name":"Vaun Wilmott"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1866969113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMzA0MDkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ1NDkxNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMzA0MDkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ1NDkxNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The second season of Syfy's Dominion premieres on Thursday, July 9th."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sarah (played by Robin Tunney) is the new girl at a Catholic shool in Los Angeles where she meets a group of girls (Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True) who dabble in witchcraft. When Sarah joins the group they discover that they have genuine power and start using it to sort out their personal problems, until the group's leader Nacy (Balk) starts taking it too far.\n\nThe film is well-made and several shades darker than the average teen movie.

I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation. Which could be caused by a lot of things but is most likely the result of trimming in post-production, in which important unifying elements were left on the cutting room floor. Or it could be that the director and production designer just failed to translate the writer's vision onto the screen.\n\nSince this ultimately this is a story about an evil character who develops a sentimental side, it is absolutely critical that this process is communicated to the audience.

In this regard the movie is a complete failure.\n\nThen there is the issue of cheating. Because we only know what he wants to tell us, a director has a variety of legit ways to introduce misdirection and surprise into a film. But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy (Chazz Palminteri). It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.\n\nWhatever, it means that the only reason to watch this version of "Diabolique" is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hard-as-nails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.\n\nIf you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original "Diabolique", track down 1971's "Let's Scare Jessica To Death". This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's "Diabolique", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental "institution" who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area. The odd locals and their local legends begin to mess with Jessica's head as her husband and his secret girlfriend attempt to scare her to death.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14109,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

If you like slow build/"Memento" like stories with the flashback/present structure, you'll really enjoy "The Harrow". I was pleasantly surprised how the characters pulled me into their worlds, and there's a great sense of menace that hangs over the film, even though you know from the get go the beautiful Gale (played by the stunning Maggie Geha) is to meet a horrible end. The sister, Ruth shows up years later (a great performance by Sonya Harum) and she stirs the pot of the haunted Miller (a solid performance by Tom McKay, from the Hatfield McCoys TV show) and his memory slowly comes back to the horror of a fateful night that took his lover, Gale from him. There is a great twist at the end, but don't want to spoil it, but the ending is all the more meaningful because of the dramatic build up to the end. It's not horror movie material, but its definitely great dramatic/psychological thriller material if you're looking for a really good story with great performances and solid direction. It's also a beautiful film to look at if you love great cinematography.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":317,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5},"genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2016-11-03","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Harrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi271758873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZkMTBiOGEtNGVhNi00Y2ZiLTkyNzMtZmRjNzA3MTA0N2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZkMTBiOGEtNGVhNi00Y2ZiLTkyNzMtZmRjNzA3MTA0N2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Harrow"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2168260/","name":"Tom McKay"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3578260/","name":"Sonya Harum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1105205/","name":"Lars Gerhard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3177051/","name":"Kevin Stocklin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0271106/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3177051/","name":"Kevin Stocklin"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you like slow build/"Memento" like stories with the flashback/present structure, you'll really enjoy "The Harrow". I was pleasantly surprised how the characters pulled me into their worlds, and there's a great sense of menace that hangs over the film, even though you know from the get go the beautiful Gale (played by the stunning Maggie Geha) is to meet a horrible end. The sister, Ruth shows up years later (a great performance by Sonya Harum) and she stirs the pot of the haunted Miller (a solid performance by Tom McKay, from the Hatfield McCoys TV show) and his memory slowly comes back to the horror of a fateful night that took his lover, Gale from him. There is a great twist at the end, but don't want to spoil it, but the ending is all the more meaningful because of the dramatic build up to the end. It's not horror movie material, but its definitely great dramatic/psychological thriller material if you're looking for a really good story with great performances and solid direction. It's also a beautiful film to look at if you love great cinematography.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":317,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2016-11-03","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Harrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi271758873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZkMTBiOGEtNGVhNi00Y2ZiLTkyNzMtZmRjNzA3MTA0N2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZkMTBiOGEtNGVhNi00Y2ZiLTkyNzMtZmRjNzA3MTA0N2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Harrow","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2168260/","name":"Tom McKay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3578260/","name":"Sonya Harum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1105205/","name":"Lars Gerhard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3177051/","name":"Kevin Stocklin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0271106/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3177051/","name":"Kevin Stocklin"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation. Which could be caused by a lot of things but is most likely the result of trimming in post-production, in which important unifying elements were left on the cutting room floor. Or it could be that the director and production designer just failed to translate the writer's vision onto the screen.\n\nSince this ultimately this is a story about an evil character who develops a sentimental side, it is absolutely critical that this process is communicated to the audience. The audience should not just be surprised by the ending but should be able to think back and see all the motivational pieces click into place. In this regard the movie is a complete failure.\n\nThen there is the issue of cheating. Because we only know what he wants to tell us, a director has a variety of legit ways to introduce misdirection and surprise into a film. But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy (Chazz Palminteri). It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.\n\nWhatever, it means that the only reason to watch this version of "Diabolique" is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hard-as-nails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.\n\nIf you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original "Diabolique", track down 1971's "Let's Scare Jessica To Death". This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's "Diabolique", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental "institution" who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area. The odd locals and their local legends begin to mess with Jessica's head as her husband and his secret girlfriend attempt to scare her to death.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14109,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation.

That said, "The Equalizer" was not a film I was necessarily clamoring for a sequel to--although I still was looking forward to it since Denzel Washington and the action scenes in the trailer would be worthwhile. After seeing "The Equalizer 2" at an advance screening, I can say that while the film is not perfect, it's an entertaining ride for adult action junkies that is on par with the first movie in terms of quality.\n\nDenzel returns as Robert McCall, a vigilante-type figure and former special forces operative who begins the movie on a mission in Turkey. After such prologue, the film centers in on its primary narrative thread: a woman who he worked with on multiple missions has been killed by thugs in Brussels. The rest of the film primarily concerns McCall's attempt to bring the perpetrators of such heinous crime to justice, although the film also contains multiple sub-plots--including a new, older adolescent-age character who could theoretically become somewhat of a protégé to McCall in a possible third movie in the franchise.\n\nThe action scenes in "The Equalizer 2" are thrilling and intense. Sometimes the intersection of Fuqua's cinematography choices and sound edits can feel and appear a bit choppy at times, but the film certainly brings the white-knuckle goods. The film's action-packed finale scene, a climatic showdown in the midst of an incredibly rough hurricane, is thoroughly effective and satisfying. Just like the first movie, the violence in "The Equalizer 2" certainly earns its R rating. Denzel Washington is great as McCall, blending a unique mix of charisma and ferocity. Just like in the first movie, he is able to carry the film on all of its levels from beginning to end. That said, the film does have one large flaw--that of which the story is highly predictable. If you've seen any other "vigilante"-style action movie before, you'll be able to guess the key plot elements well before they unfold, and the film's sole attempt at a plot twist can be guessed within the first 20 minutes of the movie. \n\nFans of the first movie and Denzel Washington should be able to look past such banality and enjoy the action-packed ride, and I do recommend the film to them. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148845,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-07-20","keywords":"brussels belgium,woman fights a man,gun,returning character killed off,gunfight","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1943583513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVkNmVjOTktNjM1MS00MTI1LWI3NDYtYzc5MDAwNjhjOGRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVkNmVjOTktNjM1MS00MTI1LWI3NDYtYzc5MDAwNjhjOGRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Robert McCall serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, but how far will he go when that is someone he loves?"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0050959/","name":"Pedro Pascal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5480894/","name":"Ashton Sanders"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035535/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921013/","name":"Richard Wenk"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805994/","name":"Michael Sloan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2030456/","name":"Richard Lindheim"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm beyond fed up with shows parading hardcore feminists while watering down the strength of men. This show displays the strength of both. Men are physically stronger than women. Women seem to be smarter than men. That's okay by me. Here you don't see 110 pound women beating up scores of 200 pound, well trained fighters, which is ludicrous every time I see that nonsense (with the exception of vampires). Here, women are fighting like warriors to hold the family together and are also providing the intel (brains) for the testosterone packing heterosexual males. They compliment each other versus compete, as it should be. If there is a noise in the house, unlike the woke crowd, I won't tell my wife it's her turn to check it out. I won't ask her to flip a coin to see who should stand between an assailant and the spouse.\n\nThe woke war on masculine heterosexual males has not impacted this show (so far in season 1).

It is more intense than Da Vinci Code. I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels &amp; Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.\n\nThe story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought.

It is more intense than Da Vinci Code. I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels &amp; Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.\n\nThe story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought. The sets are amazing too.\n\nOverall: Fans of the book will flock the cinemas to catch this. Fans of the previous movie, Da Vinci Code, should also catch this.

Zobrist believes that the Earth's population that has an exponential growth should be reduced in 50% to save the other 50%. In Florence, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) awakens in a hospital with no memory of the last two days and with daydreams and dreadful visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones) explains that he has a head trauma cause by a bullet that scratched his head and he would recover his memory in a few days.

Robert Langdon is a superman since he is wounded and with amnesia, but capable of run, jump over the walls, recalls details such as hidden passages and door in different locations etc. The plot point with Sienna Brooks is totally predictable and it was obvious that she had teamed up with Langdon to find where the virus is. The romance between Langdon and Elizabeth Sinskey, performed by the unknown Sidse Babett Knudsen, has no chemistry. In the end, "Inferno" is absolutely forgettable.

So I saw it a second time, and loved it even more.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399178,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"apocalypse,ensemble cast,actress playing herself,actor playing himself,male friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Band Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi166438425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNjI0ODE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExMjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNjI0ODE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExMjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Six friends become trapped in a house after a series of strange and catastrophic events devastate Los Angeles.

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That said, "The Equalizer" was not a film I was necessarily clamoring for a sequel to--although I still was looking forward to it since Denzel Washington and the action scenes in the trailer would be worthwhile. After seeing "The Equalizer 2" at an advance screening, I can say that while the film is not perfect, it's an entertaining ride for adult action junkies that is on par with the first movie in terms of quality.\n\nDenzel returns as Robert McCall, a vigilante-type figure and former special forces operative who begins the movie on a mission in Turkey. After such prologue, the film centers in on its primary narrative thread: a woman who he worked with on multiple missions has been killed by thugs in Brussels. The rest of the film primarily concerns McCall's attempt to bring the perpetrators of such heinous crime to justice, although the film also contains multiple sub-plots--including a new, older adolescent-age character who could theoretically become somewhat of a protégé to McCall in a possible third movie in the franchise.\n\nThe action scenes in "The Equalizer 2" are thrilling and intense. Sometimes the intersection of Fuqua's cinematography choices and sound edits can feel and appear a bit choppy at times, but the film certainly brings the white-knuckle goods. The film's action-packed finale scene, a climatic showdown in the midst of an incredibly rough hurricane, is thoroughly effective and satisfying. Just like the first movie, the violence in "The Equalizer 2" certainly earns its R rating. Denzel Washington is great as McCall, blending a unique mix of charisma and ferocity. Just like in the first movie, he is able to carry the film on all of its levels from beginning to end. That said, the film does have one large flaw--that of which the story is highly predictable. If you've seen any other "vigilante"-style action movie before, you'll be able to guess the key plot elements well before they unfold, and the film's sole attempt at a plot twist can be guessed within the first 20 minutes of the movie. \n\nFans of the first movie and Denzel Washington should be able to look past such banality and enjoy the action-packed ride, and I do recommend the film to them. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148845,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-07-20","keywords":"brussels belgium,woman fights a man,gun,returning character killed off,gunfight","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1943583513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVkNmVjOTktNjM1MS00MTI1LWI3NDYtYzc5MDAwNjhjOGRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVkNmVjOTktNjM1MS00MTI1LWI3NDYtYzc5MDAwNjhjOGRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Robert McCall serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, but how far will he go when that is someone he loves?"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0050959/","name":"Pedro Pascal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5480894/","name":"Ashton Sanders"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035535/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921013/","name":"Richard Wenk"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805994/","name":"Michael Sloan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2030456/","name":"Richard Lindheim"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

I want to give it a higher rating because at the end of each episode I've looked forward to the next one; However, the lack of logic and common sense (particularly in the earlier episodes) as well as continuity issues prevents me from doing so. The yo-yo effect of both main characters' commitment to the case, the unrealistic reactions by some of the characters in some instances and the confusing timeline references distract me from what would otherwise be a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience. I have the season 1 finale to watch yet and I believe the show has been picked up for a second season so I will look forward to that. I hope some of the flaws will be addressed for series 2 but, I also hope the overall look and feel won't be drastically altered. Some shows in the past have been tweaked into nonexistence by network brass and viewer opinions. This first season seemed to be generally headed in the right direction. "Burden of Truth" could have a long run if handled properly.\n\nAddendum: The way I rate shows... I don't usually review anything less than a 7 because 6 would be a failing grade and I won't waste my time watching it. I'm old; I don't know how much time I've got left.

The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen. Candice is like a female Columbo version in high heels, handbag pink scarf and a 9mm in her holster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt2819924/","name":"Candice Renoir","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM3YzUxM2UtZjIyMC00Zjg5LTk0NTMtNGQ3ZWQ0ODhlMTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0NTExNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Acting, camera work, jokes, and banter between coworkers, all served to create a believable environment. And that dark past of his, just waiting to be revealed and possibly destroy everything, hovers in the background, creating tension. I find myself waiting for the next episode. One reviewer complains about there being a personal story behind the main character, but that's how we end up finding out about that mysterious past of his. And, seriously, what do they want? A cardboard cutout character with minimal lines and no home life? The added drama keeps the show interesting, adds extra levels to the character as it goes, and family members are always potentially at risk when there's a hero character involved, so there's that. Give the show a chance and don't pay attention to bad reviews if you already think you might like something.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7057,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-03-09","keywords":"doctor,caucasian,latex gloves,forensic pathologist,dead body","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344435/","name":"Ioan Gruffudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0319696/","name":"Darren Gilshenan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0960946/","name":"Damien Garvey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110425/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207641/","name":"Stephen M.

First, most of the main cast are extremely good actors. Vic, Aceveda and Shane were the most powerful. Second, the storyline and the length of the chapters are quite good too. Probably the story could have been told with 4-5 seasons easily. But it is what it is. Last, camera work, make up and sound are pretty cool. I can't believe this show started on 2002. On the other hand, seems some characters were not fully developed or look like the writers didn't want to give them credit. But not a big thing. So, overall if you're looking for an excellent cops show, brutal, raw and almost perfect, this one is for you. Now, I'm going to watch The Wire.

First, most of the main cast are extremely good actors. Vic, Aceveda and Shane were the most powerful. Second, the storyline and the length of the chapters are quite good too. Probably the story could have been told with 4-5 seasons easily. But it is what it is. Last, camera work, make up and sound are pretty cool. I can't believe this show started on 2002.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2819924, Title: Candice Renoir, 
 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen. Candice is like a female Columbo version in high heels, handbag pink scarf and a 9mm in her holster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt2819924/","name":"Candice Renoir","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM3YzUxM2UtZjIyMC00Zjg5LTk0NTMtNGQ3ZWQ0ODhlMTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0NTExNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France.

This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625090,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625090,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  \n\nThis is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).\n\nIn conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary.

Santa Claus, as played as screen icon Mel Gibson, is not really "fat" as the title would imply, but Mel makes the character a badass. However, Chris has incurred the wrath of a thoroughly repugnant devil-child. Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a rich 12 year old child whose nasty actions have motivated Chris to gift the kid with a lump of coal. But the kid retaliates by calling upon his favorite hitman (the great character actor Walton Goggins), and hiring him to assassinate Chris!\n\n"Fatman" was, for this viewer, an ingeniously twisted little tale that works hard to be edgy, and delivers some good dark comedy. Of course, it's far from being for all tastes, especially as we see that Billy is ready and willing to torture a schoolmate when she wins a science fair first prize that he feels should have been his. Fairly grim (but not overwhelmingly so), and very violent, the film also delivers some unexpected poignancy as Chris bemoans the state of the world today - and the bad attitudes of its children. Chris himself has fallen on such hard times that he enters into a temporary partnership with the U. S. military, where the elves will be making product other than toys.\n\nMel is in fine form, and he and the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste make for a rather endearing Mr. And Mrs. Claus. Goggins is superb as the icy-cold, super-efficient hired killer who has his own reasons for wanting to bump off St. Nick. (One amusing character trait is that "Skinny Man"s' pet of choice is a hamster.) Young Hurstfield is very, very good at creating a child character so despicable that you hate him from the word go.\n\nIn general, whatever problems the movie has are made up for by the entertaining story that provides an off-the-beaten path experience for those viewers who may be tired of "feel good" fare.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"christmas,santa claus character,post office,assassin,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830914841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To save his declining business, Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson), also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military.

Santa Claus, as played as screen icon Mel Gibson, is not really "fat" as the title would imply, but Mel makes the character a badass. However, Chris has incurred the wrath of a thoroughly repugnant devil-child. Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a rich 12 year old child whose nasty actions have motivated Chris to gift the kid with a lump of coal. But the kid retaliates by calling upon his favorite hitman (the great character actor Walton Goggins), and hiring him to assassinate Chris!\n\n"Fatman" was, for this viewer, an ingeniously twisted little tale that works hard to be edgy, and delivers some good dark comedy. Of course, it's far from being for all tastes, especially as we see that Billy is ready and willing to torture a schoolmate when she wins a science fair first prize that he feels should have been his. Fairly grim (but not overwhelmingly so), and very violent, the film also delivers some unexpected poignancy as Chris bemoans the state of the world today - and the bad attitudes of its children. Chris himself has fallen on such hard times that he enters into a temporary partnership with the U. S. military, where the elves will be making product other than toys.\n\nMel is in fine form, and he and the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste make for a rather endearing Mr. And Mrs. Claus. Goggins is superb as the icy-cold, super-efficient hired killer who has his own reasons for wanting to bump off St. Nick. (One amusing character trait is that "Skinny Man"s' pet of choice is a hamster.) Young Hurstfield is very, very good at creating a child character so despicable that you hate him from the word go.\n\nIn general, whatever problems the movie has are made up for by the entertaining story that provides an off-the-beaten path experience for those viewers who may be tired of "feel good" fare.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"christmas,santa claus character,post office,assassin,elf","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830914841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To save his declining business, Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson), also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military.

I saw it and knew instantly how badly I wanted to see it. I've never been a fan of Margot Robbie and her previous acting efforts but this looked like her awakening and where she would be proving me wrong. I believe it, she's quite sensational in this film. Her dedication to her role shows but really everyone involved has done very well. Craig Gillespie has his first real winner with I, Tonya.\n\nI, Tonya is a biographical picture about famed and disgraced figure skater, Tonya Harding. Tonya was pushed onto the rink by her abusive mother at a very young age and despite the abuse becomes a very talented ice skater. The cycle of abuse continues with her abusive husband but she tries to bear through and succeed. Everyone seems to be against her but her talent is hard to deny. The film also goes into the famed attack on fellow ice skater Nancy Kerrigan and the aftermath of the incident.\n\nThe film is sort of told from a mockumentary perspective as if key characters are being interviewed. The film also utilizes breaking the fourth wall where characters in a scene would talk to the audience. I thought this was interesting and separates itself from being a standard biopic and gives this film a real comedic depth. The soundtrack is catchy and literally every performance in this film makes for a very engaging time. I didn't even recognize the chameleon Bobby Cannavale until the credits rolled.\n\nSome wonder why the film was made but it kind of helps you identify with Tonya. She suffered physical and psychological abuse from both her foul mouthed mother and her rage filled husband. Her hands may not be completely clean in what happens to Nancy Kerrigan, but she is also just a victim of circumstances. Vastly talented, but just short of reaching her pinnacle due to outside factors and her image and attitude. The film isn't perfect but its vastly entertaining and could be giving Margot Robbie and Allison Janney Oscar nominations. I'm going to let this sink in and I'm sure its going to be something I go back to.\n\n7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":202053,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-05","keywords":"ice skating,violence,abuse,female protagonist,ice skater","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer: I, Tonya","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4244617241","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises among the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659221/","name":"Sebastian Stan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005049/","name":"Allison Janney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318916/","name":"Craig Gillespie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465607/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312433/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0737216/","name":"Steven Rogers"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It really is a fantastic ensemble from very different parts of the world and from different eras and acting schools. You can imagine how disappointed I was when I finally got to see the movie. A very slow, soulless piece, with very little energy and absolutely no interest. And the biggest sin was that Ira Sachs gave all this wonderful and accomplished actors absolutely nothing to work from. Not even the beautiful imagery of Sintra could save this. What a shame and a wasted opportunity.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1638,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-08-28","keywords":"character name as title,one word title,female protagonist,singing,swimming pool","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1866972185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNiZDg5ZTEtYzMwMi00ZWRiLThkZTctYzA5NmE4YTIwZjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNiZDg5ZTEtYzMwMi00ZWRiLThkZTctYzA5NmE4YTIwZjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Unfolding over the course of a late summer's day in the fabled resort town of Sintra, Portugal, 'Frankie' follows three generations who have gathered for a vacation organized by the family matriarch (Isabelle Huppert).

Of course, it's far from being for all tastes, especially as we see that Billy is ready and willing to torture a schoolmate when she wins a science fair first prize that he feels should have been his.

(One amusing character trait is that "Skinny Man"s' pet of choice is a hamster.) Young Hurstfield is very, very good at creating a child character so despicable that you hate him from the word go.\n\nIn general, whatever problems the movie has are made up for by the entertaining story that provides an off-the-beaten path experience for those viewers who may be tired of "feel good" fare.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"christmas,santa claus character,post office,assassin,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830914841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To save his declining business, Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson), also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military.

It is my second fave horror anthology(ABCs of Death just! beating it) and is a horror film I love very fondly. If you haven't seen it, see it!\n\nPart 2 was full of bad camera work, worse acting, and some of the most bonkers stuff you could think of to put on screen. It is a Z grade film, that gets everything so wrong on a technical level that it becomes oddly charming. In other words it is a pure so bad it's good and I find it hilarious. A lot of people hate it(and I can see why!) but I love it for much the same reason so many people like Troll 2.\n\nBut that of course asks, what kind of film would part 3 be? A cult classic social commentary dark horror film like the original, or a trash fire comedy miss step like part 2?\n\nWell part 3 feels very much like it was made in response to the bad feed back part 2 got. The film plays itself VERY safe. Only one of the four stories is even actually a commentary on racism. The rest could take place in any old anthology series. All the stories are a lot more down to Earth and much less over the top then anything was in part 2, or even the original. This does make the film pretty predictable. Since it is playing things so held back and safe you will be able to call out the plot twists well before they happen. A lot of people are going to complain that this film is very paint by numbers and formulaic.\n\nBUT along with playing things much more by the numbers the film makes itself much more competently. Camera work, good, acting good, pacing, good. Nothing is AMAZING! But there are no bad miss steps anywhere besides some weak CGI here and there. I do feel the one story about racism, the second one, is pretty darn good and feels like it would have been at home in the first film. The third story, though as said it could be from any horror anthology series, is still a good story that is well done and charming. It also has the first queer character for the series! Cool! :) The other two stories though predictable are by no means bad. So yes, this is an anthology with not a single bad story! Which is pretty good in my book.\n\nYa, you can nit pick it(the idea of this like six year old telling a grown man about a story where a man has sex with a blowup doll is pretty wonderfully absurd), but if you do you'll be just hating it for hating it sake.\n\nNo, this is a light going, turn your mind off, grab some Halloween candy with friends, kind of horror film. It's time killer, but very well done time killer and I think fans of the original will be over all pleased.\n\n6.8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"anthology,camera shot from inside a refrigerator,beaten to death,burned alive,gore","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8358598/","name":"Patrick Abellard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11051116/","name":"Frederick Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11086603/","name":"Djouliet Amara"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The scenes would be hard to do in standup because they involve a setup with circumstances and other characters - but it resembles standup in that each scene and the dialogue almost completely make up the substance and humor of the film. You have a well-intentioned millennial named Josh played by Justin Long who despite his best efforts simply cannot avoid putting his foot in his mouth. A large part of the humor deals with overly-sensitive and politically correct people, who Josh simply cannot avoid enraging - this comes out through taboo topics like sexual abuse, overly protected children, sexual philandering, and death. It's just hilarious to watch each scene spiral out of control with Josh coming out with mud on his face looking like the aggressor or bad guy, even though his intentions are good. He tries so hard to deal with each situation but just falls on his face and can never say the right thing, even when nearly one else has no problem doing so. So this dynamic is the setup for comedy; a series of blunders. I can see it compared to Woody Allen, mainly in Josh's hasty dialogue and frantic, victim mentality. But it's a little different, probably more like Amy Schumer - this is a little more of satire with dark, awkward, and deadpan humor. Josh has no redeeming qualities to speak of whereas Woody Allen's early characters seemed to be more cunning and find a way out on top. You won't get much of a story but if you like this type of humor you will be laughing out loud.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":671,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-15","keywords":"jew,jewish,teacher student relationship,adjunct professor,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"After Class","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1908522777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2547958/","name":"Kate Berlant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169565/","name":"Lynn Cohen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But on the whole, this is an over-the-top, pretentious dud, the sort of thing that should be seen only by the paid critics who then have a professional obligation and civic duty to spare all the rest of us such an irritating waste of our time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2003-10-17","keywords":"sex standing up,lift skirt,panties hit the floor,panties pulled down,fondling","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538048/","name":"Krzysztof Majchrzak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272295/","name":"Adam Ferency","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322937/","name":"Krzysztof Globisz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094194/","name":"Luc Bondy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102722/","name":"Gérard Brach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326822/","name":"Witold Gombrowicz"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was a perfect role, perfect timing and a perfect opportunity to show people that he could play something other than the heavy or the bad guy. MY COUSIN VINNY is really just a distant cousin of his character in Goodfellas anyway.  Just imagine one of the guys in Goodfellas that didn't want to follow in the footsteps of the rest of the gangsters and this is him. Vinny is a foul mouthed, sometime violent, insecure but smart man.  He went to law school but took six attempts before he passed the bar.  They are definitely similar characters.

Fred Gwynne supplies some of the best comedy for the film with his constant badgering of Vinny.  Everything from his suit, to his enunciation of words like "youts", to his court room impropriety to his just plain dislike of him.  Gwynne and Pesci are so opposite as people. Gwynne being a giant of a man with a southern drawl and a long, virile face while Pesci is a short man with a distinct New Yawk slur and a pudgy, baby looking face.

The movie is about a man who is accused of murder with no real evidence except for his name, which happens to be Jurek Kiler. He gets himself into a much deeper situation throughout the movie. There are several real funny lines in the movie, but I doubt they are quite as funny when translated into English. Jerzy Stuhr, arguably Poland's greatest actor, plays the lead detective and anything he says is funny. In Polish comedies the humor is not so much in what is said, but how it is said. The humor for the most part comes from the ironic tones and facial expressions of the actors. For those who are not familiar with Polish film history the first, and for a long time only, film making academy was in Poland. Many of the camera crews, set directors, and props directors from Hollywood were actually educated at this Polish institute. I hope you enjoy the film. Cheers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1997-11-17","keywords":"character name as title,serial murder,surname as title,one word title,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668640/","name":"Cezary Pazura"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469021/","name":"Malgorzata Kozuchowska"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836136/","name":"Jerzy Stuhr"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532702/","name":"Juliusz Machulski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093411/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093398/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921264/","name":"Piotr Weresniak"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

I felt like it was trying too hard to be too many things.  Using a mixture of various film makers styles it just didn't seem to provide anything fresh. The story telling method used too many twists to work successfully. If stylish visuals and multi layered stories are your main thing then give it a go. Otherwise you may find some of the negative comments and low scores this film has attracted to be justified.\n\nMy rating 5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-11","keywords":"bare chested male bondage,tied to a bed,revenge,written by director,wager","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi671922201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, 'Terminal' follows the twisting tales of two assassins carrying out a sinister mission, a teacher battling a fatal illness, an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress leading a dangerous double life.

During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  \n\nThis is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).\n\nIn conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.

It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary. Observed annually on 26 January, it marks the 1788 raising of the British flag at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip following days of exploration in New South Wales by the First Fleet.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-28","keywords":"topless woman,bare breasts,shooting,spearing,aboriginal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3634085913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Gutjuk teams up with ex-sniper Travis to track down the most dangerous warrior in the Territory, who is also his uncle.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary. Observed annually on 26 January, it marks the 1788 raising of the British flag at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip following days of exploration in New South Wales by the First Fleet.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-28","keywords":"topless woman,bare breasts,shooting,spearing,aboriginal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3634085913","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Gutjuk teams up with ex-sniper Travis to track down the most dangerous warrior in the Territory, who is also his uncle.

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":301757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Bridge of Spies: Directed by Steven Spielberg. With Mark Rylance, Domenick Lombardozzi, Victor Verhaeghe, Mark Fichera. During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt3682448/","name":"Bridge of Spies","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTI0MjU5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM4OTk4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3682448/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Quinoa1984","dateCreated":"2015-10-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"carries a spirit of all-American-ism without being too preachy, keeping a wit about it and Tom Hanks","reviewBody":"One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold.

The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.\n\nAs I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous.

Very little outside 'the norm' is required for teenagers to ostracize one of their own. Sometimes it's a haircut or a brand of shoes, or even some other minor detail that sets them apart. But when it's a mental illness, the tribe can be merciless. Director Thor Freudenthal (DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, 2010) takes on Julia Walton's 2017 novel, with a screenplay from Nick Naveda. The film features two rising young stars and addresses some of the challenges brought on by the uncertainties associated with a mental illness.\n\nCharlie Plummer (so terrific in LEAN ON PETE, 2018) stars as Adam, a high school senior who has dealt with the challenges of undiagnosed mental health issues since he was quite young. His father abandoned the family years ago, and Adam's devoted mother (Molly Parker, "House of Cards") is not only patient and loving, but also committed to researching any possible treatment that would lead Adam to a better life. On the other hand, Adam and his mother's new live-in lover Paul (Walton Goggins) don't exactly see eye-to-eye on things, leading to more anxiety for Adam.\n\nIn an interesting and unique approach, director Freudenthal allows us to not only hear the voices Adam hears, but also see the hallucinations and visions he sees - three of whom are Rebecca (AnnaSophia Robb, THE WAY WAY BACK), a sweet, hippie-ish optimist; The Bodyguard (Lobo Sebastian), a cigar-chomping, bat swinging he-man; and Joaquin (Devon Bostick), an inappropriately horny 'best friend from a 90's move." On top of that, there is a black mist that periodically manifests, enveloping Adam and bringing on crippling fear and isolation. After a years-long stream of drug therapy, Adam is pronounced "treatment resistant" and diagnosed as schizophrenic. Adam's only mind-calming escape is when he's cooking. He knows his way around the kitchen and his goal is to attend Culinary School after graduation.\n\nOne day, Adam has a psychotic break during Chemistry class. He gets expelled, which jeopardizes his Culinary School dream. His mother gets him admitted to a Catholic School run by Sister Catherine (Beth Grant) at the same time he is accepted into an experimental drug trial. He's allowed to stay in school as long as he takes his meds and maintains his grades. It's here where he meets the dynamic Maya (Taylor Russell (WAVES, 2019). Maya is smart and ambitious and proud, and the two quickly form a bond - an interesting bond between two smart high school kids carrying their own burdens and holding their own secrets.\n\nSister Catherine is balancing the specific needs of Adam with her responsibility to the school, and then there is also prom and graduation to deal with. With the new drug, the voices and visions disappear, but Adam has some issues with the side effects. A desperate plea for help from Father Patrick (Andy Garcia), the school priest, provides a boost as Adam tells him, "It's nice to be listened to and not just observed." That line provides significant insight into what it's like to have this affliction, and that's really where the movie excels ... putting us in the shoes of a schizophrenic and allowing us to experience the good and bad moments. What can Adam trust? His eyes? His ears? His mind?\n\nAdam and Maya are both trying to figure out who they are, at the same time learning what it really means to love someone. Adam refers to his illness as his "burgeoning insanity", and in fact, schizophrenia does have a history of accelerating over time once it strikes a young person. The movie succeeds in taking away some of the mystique of mental illness, by making it approachable and something we want to better understand. There is a visual reference to Van Gogh's "Starry Night" that might be a bit too "nail on the head", but Freudenthal's movie is profound and features two very talented young actors. The humanity beneath the surface of those society would rather pretend don't exist is effectively compared to those stricken with cancer ... those we would do anything for. I watched this film back-to-back with another teen-drama-romance new release entitled CHEMICAL HEARTS, and it's extremely rare to find two such thought-provoking films centered on a pair of high school students ... but quite a treat (although I believe all 4 actors are long past high school age).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8066,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-08-21","keywords":"based on young adult novel,schizophrenia,hallucination,hospital,restraint","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3428105753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A teenager coping with paranoid schizophrenia hopes his new experimental drug treatment will help him navigate high school and the outside world."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4055138/","name":"Charlie Plummer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5347988/","name":"Taylor Russell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294457/","name":"Thor Freudenthal"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0811450/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0192696/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4550950/","name":"Nick Naveda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9649443/","name":"Julia Walton"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Jojo Rabbit: Directed by Taika Waititi. With Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi. A young German boy in the Hitler Youth whose hero and imaginary friend is the country's dictator is shocked to discover that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2584384/","name":"Jojo Rabbit","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU0Yzk2MzEtMjAzYy00MzY0LTg2YmItM2RkNzdkY2ZhN2JkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDg4NjY5OTQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young German boy in the Hitler Youth whose hero and imaginary friend is the country's dictator is shocked to discover that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2584384/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator"},"dateCreated":"2019-09-18","inLanguage":"English","name":"A heartfelt satire needed for today","reviewBody":"Probably one of the most controversial films to come out of TIFF, I went into Jojo Rabbit with cautionious optimism since I am fan of Taika Waititi while still being aware of the divineness it has spawned in some critics. I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350018,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2019-10-24","keywords":"nazi germany,world war two,satire,mother son relationship,black comedy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663366425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer director Taika Waititi (THOR: RAGNAROK, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE), brings his signature style of humor and pathos to his latest film, JOJO RABBIT, a World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy (Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character.

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present.

The cast is simply to die for: Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth the elder; her daughter Joely Richardson as Elizabeth the younger; Rafe Spall as Shakespeare (a talentless clod of an actor); Sebastian Arnesto as Ben Johnson (a talented playwright, but not even in the same galaxy of greatness as the author of Shakespeare's plays); David Thewlis as William Cecil; Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil; Derek Jacobi doing the prologue; Jaime Campbell Bower (from "Camelot") as the younger Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford; and Rhys Ifans as the older Edward de Vere, and the real author of Shakespeare's work.\n\nAs presented, the plot is not at all a scholarly argument for the Earl of Oxford's authorship of these plays. It is instead a clever reimagining of historical events (some treated as loosely as Shakespeare himself treated actual history) to turn the answer to the mystery that scholars argue about into a taut political thriller. In Orloff's/Emmerich's vision, Edward de Vere wrote the plays and published them under someone else's name for no less a reason that to foment revolution, change the course of history, and determine the next king of England.\n\nAnd damnit, that reimagining kinda worked for me. The sets and costumes are pitch perfect, the performances are good, and the potential is there for a good time to be had by all.

Orloff really did his research. Except for the part about Edward de Vere having died before at least 10 of Shakespeare's plays were written, that is. But that's just a nitpick, and should not stand in the way of writing a good drama. Those kinds of historical nitpicks did not deter Shakespeare, and they don't deter Orloff and Emmerich.

I could digest some of the American jingoism paraded recently in all their sci-fi movies, but when you are delivering something about a region torn by American hegemonic war of 16 years (and counting), the jokes about Afghan men humping donkeys as a joke just brings bad taste in the mouth.\n\nThe movie is based on the memoirs of a news journalist (real life Kim Baker book ' The Taliban shuffle') who is reluctantly pushed in the war torn Afghanistan to cover the media news coverage. Tina fey stars as the main character. I'm not particularly fan of Tina fey and her pretending to put a girlish vibe in her 40's just doesn't cut it. The western women are presented as some sex deprived nymphs with lines of "when your p** starts eating your leg after 2 months then tell me". Really are women in west so thirsty after 2 months?. Almost half the movie is filled with partying of women, drinking, trying to be adventurous or just delivering nasty one liners to men about urinating in the open or becoming bold every time with false bravado. (seriously?)\n\nCharacters don't really seem to give any heed to the country they are trying to cover OR the poor people they are supposed to be looking out as foreign 'saviours'. Afghans are portrayed as someone belonging to neolithic period and so is the country. As a consultant who has visited Afghanistan around the same period, I can safely say that all the caricatures developed here are utter nonsense and denigrating to the country's state as many of the amenities available in a developed society are available in Afghanistan's bigger cities. Same is the depiction of Chinese brothels in Afghanistan and lines uttered about 'Taliban punishing men whose under hair used to curl on their sticks(!)' (spoken by some high profile Afghan senator) which is another unverified account.\n\nIn reality what the movie overlooks completely how American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan are living in one of the highly sophisticated luxury affairs that any soldier can dream nowadays. Hollywood depictions of how American system is better than others by taking puns on other cultures are coming off as fake and repetitively boring."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51802,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-03-04","keywords":"afghanistan,journalist,karaoke,dancing,infidelity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2132324889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NjkyODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcxNTA1NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NjkyODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcxNTA1NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the Kim Barker's memoir, Tina Fey plays a journalist reporting from war-town Afghanistan and Pakistan."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275629/","name":"Glenn Ficarra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0720135/","name":"John Requa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013731/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199243/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1061622/","name":"Robert Carlock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5092324/","name":"Kim Barker"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I could digest some of the American jingoism paraded recently in all their sci-fi movies, but when you are delivering something about a region torn by American hegemonic war of 16 years (and counting), the jokes about Afghan men humping donkeys as a joke just brings bad taste in the mouth.\n\nThe movie is based on the memoirs of a news journalist (real life Kim Baker book ' The Taliban shuffle') who is reluctantly pushed in the war torn Afghanistan to cover the media news coverage. Tina fey stars as the main character. I'm not particularly fan of Tina fey and her pretending to put a girlish vibe in her 40's just doesn't cut it. The western women are presented as some sex deprived nymphs with lines of "when your p** starts eating your leg after 2 months then tell me". Really are women in west so thirsty after 2 months?. Almost half the movie is filled with partying of women, drinking, trying to be adventurous or just delivering nasty one liners to men about urinating in the open or becoming bold every time with false bravado. (seriously?)\n\nCharacters don't really seem to give any heed to the country they are trying to cover OR the poor people they are supposed to be looking out as foreign 'saviours'. Afghans are portrayed as someone belonging to neolithic period and so is the country. As a consultant who has visited Afghanistan around the same period, I can safely say that all the caricatures developed here are utter nonsense and denigrating to the country's state as many of the amenities available in a developed society are available in Afghanistan's bigger cities. Same is the depiction of Chinese brothels in Afghanistan and lines uttered about 'Taliban punishing men whose under hair used to curl on their sticks(!)' (spoken by some high profile Afghan senator) which is another unverified account.\n\nIn reality what the movie overlooks completely how American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan are living in one of the highly sophisticated luxury affairs that any soldier can dream nowadays. Hollywood depictions of how American system is better than others by taking puns on other cultures are coming off as fake and repetitively boring.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51802,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-03-04","keywords":"afghanistan,journalist,karaoke,dancing,infidelity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2132324889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NjkyODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcxNTA1NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NjkyODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcxNTA1NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the Kim Barker's memoir, Tina Fey plays a journalist reporting from war-town Afghanistan and Pakistan.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275629/","name":"Glenn Ficarra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0720135/","name":"John Requa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013731/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199243/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1061622/","name":"Robert Carlock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5092324/","name":"Kim Barker"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Best Movie of All Time","reviewBody":"Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.\n\nThere isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.\n\nThis is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.\n\nThe final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.\n\nWhen you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":998140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1995-05-24","keywords":"scotland,revolt,legend,secret marriage,historically inaccurate","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2874063641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000521/","name":"Sophie Marceau"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000700/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042559/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078539/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"}],"duration":"PT2H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Best Movie of All Time","reviewBody":"Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative.

This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":998140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1995-05-24","keywords":"scotland,revolt,legend,secret marriage,historically inaccurate","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2874063641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000521/","name":"Sophie Marceau"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000700/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042559/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078539/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"}],"duration":"PT2H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Best Movie of All Time","reviewBody":"Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.\n\nThere isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.\n\nThis is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.\n\nThe final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.\n\nWhen you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this.

Lionel's symptoms of Tourette's syndrome, repetitive verbalizations of a rhyming nature, were accepted equanimously by everyone he encountered. No one displayed annoyance, made fun of him, or called him insulting names to cast aspersions about his intelligence. His repetitive touching of people on the shoulder as he faced them ought to have caused women to back away and men to knock his block off. They did neither. It was as if these 1950s characters had been taught the acceptance of people with disabilities that was not really commonplace until the 21st century.

Lionel's symptoms of Tourette's syndrome, repetitive verbalizations of a rhyming nature, were accepted equanimously by everyone he encountered. No one displayed annoyance, made fun of him, or called him insulting names to cast aspersions about his intelligence. His repetitive touching of people on the shoulder as he faced them ought to have caused women to back away and men to knock his block off. They did neither. It was as if these 1950s characters had been taught the acceptance of people with disabilities that was not really commonplace until the 21st century. This is the biggest mystery in the movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52898,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-01","keywords":"neo noir,1950s,jazz music,based on novel,detective","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi800112409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set against the backdrop of 1950s New York, 'Motherless Brooklyn' follows Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), a private detective living with Tourette Syndrome, as he ventures to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis). Armed only with a few clues and the engine of his obsessive mind, Lionel unravels closely-guarded secrets that hold the fate of the whole city in the balance.  In a mystery that carries him from gin-soaked jazz clubs in Harlem to the hard-edged slums of Brooklyn and, finally, into the gilded halls of New York's power brokers, Lionel contends with thugs, corruption and the most dangerous man in the city to honor his friend and save the woman who might be his own salvation.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1813221/","name":"Gugu Mbatha-Raw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113781/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113140/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504672/","name":"Jonathan Lethem"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. The gravity of the decisions Gerry has to make here are greater than any previously in the movie (where mostly he just has to run like hell!) and it's that that makes this such a powerful set piece to end the movie.

Many of the reviews here are from those who only watched the pilot, which I admit showed a rather surface-level power clash of the two main characters. But as the show has gone on (I just finished S1 E6), it has gotten increasingly interesting and much smoother to watch. I mainly started watching because of Matt Cuzchry, and he holds down the cast with a strong performance every episode. I am fascinated with their exploration of corruption in hospitals (although I think it is exaggerated at times, but what drama isn't?!), and they do weave that theme into every episode. \n\nGood overall mix of medical drama, a romance, and individual character stories that have gotten more complex and real. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-21","keywords":"two word title,atlanta georgia,hospital,latex gloves,caucasian","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194516/","name":"Matt Czuchry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2110485/","name":"Manish Dayal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339304/","name":"Bruce Greenwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0683032/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427468/","name":"Amy Holden Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2735698/","name":"Hayley Schore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6149734/","name":"Roshan Sethi"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi528529689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RjODYyNTMtZTljZC00ZmViLWEzZmYtZjExNmM2Y2I2MTQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RjODYyNTMtZTljZC00ZmViLWEzZmYtZjExNmM2Y2I2MTQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Resident" follows Dr. Conrad Hawkins, one of the best doctors at Chastain Park Memorial Hospital.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie!

While you would expect death and blood in a war film, some of the scenes in the film are amazingly tough to watch. There's actually very little blood, but there are some drowning scenes which are intense and awful. Now I am not saying don't watch it...just be prepared.\n\nThe story is a retelling of the escape of the British* from the beaches of Dunkirk. The German army was coming and the combined British and French forces were trapped with little apparent chance to escape. And, as an army of over 300,000 Brits dug in and waited, the Luftwaffe began chipping away at them....and ultimately would have killed and/or captured them all if it wasn't for a rag-tag flotilla of private boats which hastily arrived and spirited away about 80-90% of the men.\n\nBy the way, early in the film you hear someone speaking to the pilot (Tom Hardy) over the radio. The voice is that of Michael Caine....an odd and brief cameo.\n\nThe story is gripping, well told and brilliant. I have only one complaint, and I am surprised it made it to the film considering how amazing a director Christopher Nolan is. At one point, the scene switches between some men in a boat being attacked and a private yacht rescuing downed pilots. The scenes kept switching back and forth....but one was clearly at night and the other clearly was in daylight. This really didn't make any sense. Still, otherwise an amazing spectacle...a truly amazing war film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":608168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's actually very little blood, but there are some drowning scenes which are intense and awful. Now I am not saying don't watch it...just be prepared.\n\nThe story is a retelling of the escape of the British* from the beaches of Dunkirk. The German army was coming and the combined British and French forces were trapped with little apparent chance to escape. And, as an army of over 300,000 Brits dug in and waited, the Luftwaffe began chipping away at them....and ultimately would have killed and/or captured them all if it wasn't for a rag-tag flotilla of private boats which hastily arrived and spirited away about 80-90% of the men.\n\nBy the way, early in the film you hear someone speaking to the pilot (Tom Hardy) over the radio. The voice is that of Michael Caine....an odd and brief cameo.\n\nThe story is gripping, well told and brilliant. I have only one complaint, and I am surprised it made it to the film considering how amazing a director Christopher Nolan is. At one point, the scene switches between some men in a boat being attacked and a private yacht rescuing downed pilots. The scenes kept switching back and forth....but one was clearly at night and the other clearly was in daylight. This really didn't make any sense. Still, otherwise an amazing spectacle...a truly amazing war film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":608168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They are not alone, they are not lost, they have friends and allies and the resources to get out of any situation. It never feels like there is any real danger, as there is with the Toy Story films. Whereas the first film had enough focus on character development to compensate for this, the subplot about the tested friendship between McQueen and Mater seems especially insubstantial here.\n\nNevertheless, I feel like this is an enjoyable installment in the franchise, never letting your attention wander and always ready with a clever idea. They have demonstrated that they are willing to go in entirely new directions with this world - maybe if they make a third film, they can make something truly worthy of the Pixar name?\n\nIf I were rating this in comparison to other Pixar films, my score would be lower... but scoring this as a film on its own, I think it is deserving of between five and seven stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-06-24","keywords":"car race,car,best friend,spy,conspiracy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Â“Tokyo PartyÂ”","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822465049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MjE0MDk4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MjE0MDk4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A clip from Cars 2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1249256/","name":"Larry the Cable Guy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506977/","name":"Bradford Lewis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506977/","name":"Bradford Lewis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557594/","name":"Dan Fogelman"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Whereas the first film had enough focus on character development to compensate for this, the subplot about the tested friendship between McQueen and Mater seems especially insubstantial here.\n\nNevertheless, I feel like this is an enjoyable installment in the franchise, never letting your attention wander and always ready with a clever idea. They have demonstrated that they are willing to go in entirely new directions with this world - maybe if they make a third film, they can make something truly worthy of the Pixar name?\n\nIf I were rating this in comparison to other Pixar films, my score would be lower... but scoring this as a film on its own, I think it is deserving of between five and seven stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-06-24","keywords":"car race,car,best friend,spy,conspiracy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Â“Tokyo PartyÂ”","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822465049","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MjE0MDk4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MjE0MDk4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A clip from Cars 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1249256/","name":"Larry the Cable Guy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506977/","name":"Bradford Lewis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506977/","name":"Bradford Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557594/","name":"Dan Fogelman"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It may be eccentric in the sense that it may not be able to titillate the esoteric Bond fans as it may lack their eclectic style and taste but it definitely succeeds in projecting a new Bond for the contemporary world who may not be a coeval of a superhero, who despite being vulnerable has got the killer instinct in him, which is the very defining characteristic of Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. This Bond goes about his business in a fashion which is far more realistic compared to the Bond of the bygone era with an incredible passion and utmost devotion which is nothing but inexorable. Though Casino Royale was the pioneer of this graduation but its Quantum of Solace that consummates it and gives Fleming's agent a mystique which has always eluded him hitherto, an aura which gives him an opportunity to be mortal and hence a chance to qualify to be called a human.\n\nQuantum of Solace is loaded with mind blowing action sequences which makes it a high octane extravaganza. The pace of the movie is such that you hardly get time to breathe freely. The plot though comparatively weaker than its precursor, is still good enough to keep one guessing thereby keeping one at the edge of the seat, all the way through. \n\nThe only aspect of the movie which should be under the scanner is its editing which is far from just and at times needless and severely annoying. A bit constraint editing under some meticulous vigilance could have done wonders and would have probably helped it, in its quest to be the best Bond movie of all time. \n\nAll being said and given what we have, the movie fails to disappoint the audience and will surely redefine the very prerequisites of an action movie and will definitely serve as a benchmark for the movies in the years to come.\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":433920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-05","keywords":"james bond character,water rights,spy hero,secret agent,british intelligence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quantum of Solace: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1024524313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Quantum of Solace, directed by Marc Forster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0023832/","name":"Mathieu Amalric"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286975/","name":"Marc Forster"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353673/","name":"Paul Haggis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It may be eccentric in the sense that it may not be able to titillate the esoteric Bond fans as it may lack their eclectic style and taste but it definitely succeeds in projecting a new Bond for the contemporary world who may not be a coeval of a superhero, who despite being vulnerable has got the killer instinct in him, which is the very defining characteristic of Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. This Bond goes about his business in a fashion which is far more realistic compared to the Bond of the bygone era with an incredible passion and utmost devotion which is nothing but inexorable. Though Casino Royale was the pioneer of this graduation but its Quantum of Solace that consummates it and gives Fleming's agent a mystique which has always eluded him hitherto, an aura which gives him an opportunity to be mortal and hence a chance to qualify to be called a human.\n\nQuantum of Solace is loaded with mind blowing action sequences which makes it a high octane extravaganza. The pace of the movie is such that you hardly get time to breathe freely. The plot though comparatively weaker than its precursor, is still good enough to keep one guessing thereby keeping one at the edge of the seat, all the way through. \n\nThe only aspect of the movie which should be under the scanner is its editing which is far from just and at times needless and severely annoying. A bit constraint editing under some meticulous vigilance could have done wonders and would have probably helped it, in its quest to be the best Bond movie of all time. \n\nAll being said and given what we have, the movie fails to disappoint the audience and will surely redefine the very prerequisites of an action movie and will definitely serve as a benchmark for the movies in the years to come.\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":433920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-05","keywords":"james bond character,water rights,spy hero,secret agent,british intelligence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quantum of Solace: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1024524313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Quantum of Solace, directed by Marc Forster.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0023832/","name":"Mathieu Amalric"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286975/","name":"Marc Forster"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353673/","name":"Paul Haggis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unfortunately, his post-boxing career has not flourished which sees him going back to dead end jobs such as working at the meat packing company with his best friend and brother in law Paulie (Burt Young) to keep his head above financial dire straits and his newly wedded wife Adrian (Talia Shire) vows to stay loyal to him.

By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later, after three Rocky films, in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles, it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75% of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor, try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match, some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end, just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed, with all due respect to Raging Bull. \n\n Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films, he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  \n\nRocky IV is different than Rocky, there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one, it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's "There's No Easy Way Out"  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video, I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like, I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells " he's cut, he's cut! "  the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian, American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.  If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! \n\n When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.  \n\n" Rocky! Rocky!

By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later, after three Rocky films, in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles, it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75% of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor, try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match, some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end, just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed, with all due respect to Raging Bull. \n\n Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films, he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  \n\nRocky IV is different than Rocky, there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one, it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's "There's No Easy Way Out"  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video, I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like, I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells " he's cut, he's cut! "  the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian, American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.  If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! \n\n When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.  \n\n" Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":197493,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1985-11-27","keywords":"training montage,boxing,coming out of retirement,cutting down a tree,loss of friend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky IV","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3266298649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For me, Rocky V is the best of the sequels to the 1976 original, as it does not follow in the Rocky tradition of simply having a bigger guy to fight than in the previous film. Rocky IV was a great spectacle but it was more comical than anything to think that an entire Russian government could be funding one over-sized boxer who could kill a man with one flurry of punches, not to mention turn a blind eye to illegal doping.

Many of the reviews here are from those who only watched the pilot, which I admit showed a rather surface-level power clash of the two main characters. But as the show has gone on (I just finished S1 E6), it has gotten increasingly interesting and much smoother to watch. I mainly started watching because of Matt Cuzchry, and he holds down the cast with a strong performance every episode. I am fascinated with their exploration of corruption in hospitals (although I think it is exaggerated at times, but what drama isn't?!), and they do weave that theme into every episode. \n\nGood overall mix of medical drama, a romance, and individual character stories that have gotten more complex and real.

Many of the reviews here are from those who only watched the pilot, which I admit showed a rather surface-level power clash of the two main characters. But as the show has gone on (I just finished S1 E6), it has gotten increasingly interesting and much smoother to watch. I mainly started watching because of Matt Cuzchry, and he holds down the cast with a strong performance every episode. I am fascinated with their exploration of corruption in hospitals (although I think it is exaggerated at times, but what drama isn't?!), and they do weave that theme into every episode. \n\nGood overall mix of medical drama, a romance, and individual character stories that have gotten more complex and real.

But what can anyone reasonably expect? \n\nI went into this expecting exactly what I saw, it's still just a tad annoying hearing people talk about how impossible it would be to follow the book. It's not impossible at all. Look at the matrix 2&amp;3, look at pirates of the caribbean 2&amp;3, look at LOTR (it's all one continuous story). Lots of "stories" have had to be split up into multiple films and they all worked great. It's just a tad short-sighted to say it wouldn't work with a harry potter film. I think a lot of what people enjoy is looking at the wizard world, seeing cool looking spells, and generally learning more about everything to do with the harry potter universe. You don't get much of that when a 26 hour read is condensed into a 2.5 hour film. I personally would love to see more of the "boring" parts of the book simply because it's interesting seeing a high-budget Hollywood interpretation of what was in the book. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't be the least bit disappointed if the film-makers simply came out and said "this book is too long to put into a single film with out leaving out a lot of the book and changing a lot of other parts, so we're releasing it in two films." It's completely understandable. It's an 800 page book! LOTR books were only 400-600 pages and the films were considerably longer than any of the harry potter films.\n\nOverall, it was a decent enough movie though. Great special effects, good enough acting (I wouldn't go so far as to say it was amazing). I'd say it's basically a standard high-budget film. Entertaining to watch, well worth my $10 so I could come and complain how it was nothing like the book :)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":544552,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-08-15","keywords":"friendship,argus filch character,abusive uncle,bullying,albus dumbledore character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192310553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

But what can anyone reasonably expect? \n\nI went into this expecting exactly what I saw, it's still just a tad annoying hearing people talk about how impossible it would be to follow the book. It's not impossible at all. Look at the matrix 2&amp;3, look at pirates of the caribbean 2&amp;3, look at LOTR (it's all one continuous story). Lots of "stories" have had to be split up into multiple films and they all worked great. It's just a tad short-sighted to say it wouldn't work with a harry potter film. I think a lot of what people enjoy is looking at the wizard world, seeing cool looking spells, and generally learning more about everything to do with the harry potter universe. You don't get much of that when a 26 hour read is condensed into a 2.5 hour film. I personally would love to see more of the "boring" parts of the book simply because it's interesting seeing a high-budget Hollywood interpretation of what was in the book.

This is his attempt to make a fish out of water story in the style of Splash or Big and while he doesn't reinvent the wheel in doing so there were some enjoyable moments. This is obviously meant to be a film which you can watch with you family, it is not vulgar and it focuses on the importance of family values and relationships. There are many moments/jokes in this film that have to do with Judaism which Seth has joked about previously, but here this is much more of a love note to that part of his life. I think maybe some of the negativity being directed at this film is because some people don't understand that aspect of it. They instead are expecting the normal stoner humour Seth Rogen. I think this movie is worth watching if you want to see a different side of Seth and don't mind seeing the things I mentioned.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-08-06","keywords":"time travel,time traveler,immigrant,jewish,brooklyn","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3105799705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3MWM3MmYtYTdiNi00YmI4LWI2MTMtMjYzNzM4OTE1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3MWM3MmYtYTdiNi00YmI4LWI2MTMtMjYzNzM4OTE1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"AN AMERICAN PICKLE, directed by Brandon Trost, is based on Simon Rich's New Yorker novella and stars Seth Rogen as Herschel Greenbaum, a struggling laborer who immigrates to America in 1920 with dreams of building a better life for his beloved family.

This is his attempt to make a fish out of water story in the style of Splash or Big and while he doesn't reinvent the wheel in doing so there were some enjoyable moments. This is obviously meant to be a film which you can watch with you family, it is not vulgar and it focuses on the importance of family values and relationships. There are many moments/jokes in this film that have to do with Judaism which Seth has joked about previously, but here this is much more of a love note to that part of his life. I think maybe some of the negativity being directed at this film is because some people don't understand that aspect of it. They instead are expecting the normal stoner humour Seth Rogen. I think this movie is worth watching if you want to see a different side of Seth and don't mind seeing the things I mentioned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-08-06","keywords":"time travel,time traveler,immigrant,jewish,brooklyn","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3105799705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3MWM3MmYtYTdiNi00YmI4LWI2MTMtMjYzNzM4OTE1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3MWM3MmYtYTdiNi00YmI4LWI2MTMtMjYzNzM4OTE1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"AN AMERICAN PICKLE, directed by Brandon Trost, is based on Simon Rich's New Yorker novella and stars Seth Rogen as Herschel Greenbaum, a struggling laborer who immigrates to America in 1920 with dreams of building a better life for his beloved family.

Outlaws on the run have been fertile ground for movies over the years, and young director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte and writer Nicolas Zwart give the genre their best shot (pun intended). The easiest comparisons are probably Sam Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY (1972), Jonathan Demme's SOMETHING WILD (1986), and Arthur Penn's Oscar nominated classic BONNIE AND CLYDE (1969). However, given the style of this film, Terrence Malick's BADLANDS (1973) was likely more of an influence for the filmmakers.\n\nPhoebe Evans (as voiced by Lola Kirke, GONE GIRL, daughter of Bad Company drummer Simon Kirke) is our narrator, and from 1955 she recounts the story of her half-brother Eugene. Most of what she tells takes place twenty years earlier - 1935 Dust Bowl Texas during the Great Depression. Finn Cole ("Animal Kingdom") stars as Eugene, and we pick up a few years after his dad left the family behind and headed for what he expected would be an easier life in Mexico. Mother Elizabeth (Kerry Condon, "Breaking Bad") is now re-married to local Deputy George Evans (Travis Fimmel, LEAN ON PETE) and his bad haircut, and they now have a young daughter Phoebe (the magical smile of Darby Camp, THE CHRISTMAS CHRONICLES). Eugene reads Detective stories and mostly tries to stay out of George's way, while Phoebe is a curious little sister, easily the most intelligent of the lot.\n\nOne fateful day, Eugene's beloved detective stories come to life. After a local bank robbery turns violent, he discovers Allison Wells (two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie, I TONYA) hiding in his barn, with a bullet in her leg. Despite the $10,000 reward on her head, Allison sweet talks young Eugene into keeping her whereabouts secret, and helping her plot an escape. She swears she didn't kill anyone and rationalizes the bank robbery by blaming the government for letting people suffer hard times. Eugene may or may not buy her story, but he recognizes this is the most excitement he's likely to ever have in his life ... plus, he's smitten.\n\nDuring the first half of the film, we follow Eugene as he helps Allison and holds the secret. When the second half kicks in, we find ourselves along for the ride as the two are on the run from the law, including Eugene's stepfather George. Along the way director Joris-Peyrafitte includes some flashbacks to the botched bank robbery giving us a look at Allison's "Clyde", Perry Montroy (played by Garrett Hedlund). There are also numerous artsy flashes of coastline, supposedly representing Allison and Eugene's landing spot should they escape. Of course, we know where this is headed - a shootout finale. Filmed in New Mexico, we do get the feel of the hard life fought by those during this era, including the powerful and devastating dust storms that require gas masks to prevent suffocation. The film is watchable thanks to the performances and atmosphere, though it's not at the level of similar type movies listed earlier.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5108,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"bullet wound,dust storm,bank robbery,shot in the back,shot in the leg","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dreamland","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi264552729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NWFiZmMtODNjNC00ZmI4LWFkMTktNTU1NTAxMGQ4YTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NWFiZmMtODNjNC00ZmI4LWFkMTktNTU1NTAxMGQ4YTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6806440/","name":"Finn Cole"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1379938/","name":"Travis Fimmel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3098802/","name":"Miles Joris-Peyrafitte"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323227/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650540/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0542434/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4299678/","name":"Nicolaas Zwart"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.\n\nTo some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. "No Country For Old Men" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.\n\nThe film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.\n\nOverall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.\n\nThe film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.\n\n"No Country For Old Men" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":916202,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.\n\nTo some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. "No Country For Old Men" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.\n\nThe film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.\n\nOverall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.\n\nThe film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.\n\n"No Country For Old Men" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":916202,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Coming into the movie, I was ready for extremely slow space walks, but Cuaróns managed to beat my expectations by introducing welcome highly dynamic scenes to separate off the slower paced ones.\n\nThe plot was fairly standard, but here again Cuaróns managed to keep it very fresh by giving us one large surprise mid-film. One major problem with the movie was that it did not make me care for Stone which was essential to sink into the movie. Cuaróns made a strange decision to make her a person without family. Meaning that her only motivation to survive was her own survival instinct. But this decision meant that Stone could explore some topics that are available only to people without stronger survival motivations.\n\nOn a more nit-picky note, what was with that in-your-face symbolism of a womb in the middle of the movie.

I think it's quite interesting because of the script, characters and settings. A tense and raw experience.\n\nSecond, acting here is amazing in general, but specially from Collin Farrell. I think his character is the best. Brutal, savage and pretty well performed by Collin. Probably, his best acting in years.\n\nLast, I haven't read the book yet to clarify the plot holes in the series. I'm not sure why we don't know more about several characters and what happened to them.\n\nOn the contrary, last episode was the weakest one. Specially the last 20 minutes are extremely predictable to conclude the story. A wasted opportunity tu create something excellent.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you liked series like The Terror (season 1), I suggest to watch this show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2021-09-10","keywords":"19th century,whaler,doctor,sailing ship,arctic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1925239/","name":"Jack O'Connell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0819874/","name":"Sam Spruell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0230132/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010810/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi285523993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"The North Water premieres July 15 exclusively on AMC+."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

The trials and tribulations of Carrie Bradshaw and her three friends is as riveting as it is true. As a straight male viewer of this show, I think that it gave me a lot of insight into the female aspect of a relationship and the world as a whole. This show also changed the way the public views women. Carrie and company are strong, self-sufficient women who even dislike serious relationships and the prospect of marriage. This is far from the housewife days of "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best". \n\nParticularly stunning about this show is the acting. Although much has been said about the relationships between the stars of the show, the characters they portray have such a sense of reality and conviction that they seem like ordinary people trying to get by. Why this show was not awarded more is beyond me. \n\nFor anyone who wonders about human relationships and interaction, this funny yet sometimes surreal show is the perfect addition to your viewing pleasure."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":117052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"friendship between women,friendship,love life,casual sex,new york city","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Too much, too little, too late, yes? Throw in Arnold Schwarzenegger, a few European retro stars and lots of Russian vodka lime twist with Eastern and western mythical creatures thrown into the mix and viola, 2 hours of silly whack. The acting of all the actresses are blatantly cliche and nubile so prepare to dumb down. I gave a 6 for costumes, good enough special effects, scenery and enthusiastic over acting by all the extras. It's not everyday so many get to make some coin and see Jackie and Arnold buddy up.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5864,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-08-16","keywords":"sequel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Iron Mask","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1559544089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDU3ZWU3NzUtNjQxNy00ZTVmLWE4MjctNGQ2MDM3NTk0MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDU3ZWU3NzUtNjQxNy00ZTVmLWE4MjctNGQ2MDM3NTk0MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002076/","name":"Jason Flemyng","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4080670/","name":"Xingtong Yao","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000329/","name":"Jackie Chan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897071/","name":"Oleg Stepchenko"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0341688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137977/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8552961/","name":"Dmitry Paltsev","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1923871/","name":"Alexey A.

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

From 2016 to 2018, the filmmakers accompanied Joanna Jedrzejczyk, a multiple UFC champion, who at her time conquered the world of female MMA. To stay on top, the Polish fighter has to constantly confront her opponents and her own body, which is forced to make superhuman efforts over and over again. "Invincible" reveals the behind-the-scenes fights of modern gladiators, bluntly showing the blood, sweat, tears and overwhelming loneliness that are the price of the road to success in sports on a global scale." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt14849458/","name":"Niezwyciezona","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2UwYjJlNzctZjk0My00NTBkLWI0MjktZDUwYmE0ZWZkOWIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIwNTI1MTM@._V1_.jpg","description":"A dynamic and emotional story of fighting, passion and sacrifice.

I have seen all of JJ's fights and I consider her to be the best Polish athlete of the last decade. Interestingly enough, remembering the reaction of the fans in the stadiums and the bus-sized billboards of her on the main street in Vegas. She is probably more appreciated in the US than in Poland. It's a fantastic film which I've been waiting for a long time. And for those of you who think that MMA is just smashing each others faces, maybe you'll learn something and change your mind after watching it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-05-30","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7222613/","name":"Joanna Jedrzejczyk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12721669/","name":"Kami Barzini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1861859/","name":"Mike Brown"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550076/","name":"Tom Kolinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0561930/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0617166/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550076/","name":"Tom Kolinski"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As a teenager, I studied Lingua Latina and translated, for example, the writings of Julius Caesar and all the exploits throughout his career.\n\nThe Roman Army around 43AD was the most dangerous and skilled in the World; and Ancient Rome ruled most of what was the known World, they may lose a battle here and there, but rarely lost a war.\n\nAfter every battle a Legions Commander would write about both his and the enemies tactics, and send a dispatch to the Sergeant Major Of The Army, back in Rome - who would copy same, and send it to every other Roman Legion General. This way every Commander had full knowledge of the enemy. And it worked.\n\nBritannia shows just how ruthless the Roman Army and their Generals were. Kind of like, take no prisoners. Even the children were killed. Why? Because the Generals learned that when the kids grew up, they would want revenge.\n\nThere's a lot of action in Britannia and the Roman General in Britain is especially cruel. And smart.\n\nFor anyone who likes this time period, don't dwell too much on any perceived 'historical inaccuracies', just sit back and enjoy the ride. The opening music by Donnavan sets the mood. In part to me Britannia was both great and slightly crazy. Well worth your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14613,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-01-18","keywords":"soldier,roman army,roman conquest of britain,druid,female warrior","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607375/","name":"David Morrissey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5732956/","name":"Eleanor Worthington-Cox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722279/","name":"Julian Rhind-Tutt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319272/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165439/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050995/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125358/","name":"Tom Butterworth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724597/","name":"James Richardson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Britannia: Ready","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3585458457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJmZTFiNjUtYmI4MS00NzcwLTlmZDctNDkzYTc0Mzk3MjNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJmZTFiNjUtYmI4MS00NzcwLTlmZDctNDkzYTc0Mzk3MjNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Britannia: Ready"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When Tariq is killed in a motorcycle accident, Kid drops off the scene for six months but returns determined to become more than just a prospect. His ultimate aim is to challenge Smoke himself and make his mark by taking down the biggest dog there is but first he must go legit and set up his own motorcycle gang with friends Stuntman and Primo.\n\nOpening with a really nice tracking shot (or series of shots, I'm not sure) this film had my interest early on but very quickly blew it. With an obvious and predictable establishing scene, the narrative arch is established and thus I began my weary trudge from start to finish, through countless music video scenes, unconvincing dialogue scenes and loads of motorcycles. It is very basic stuff and it never aspires to much. The characters are cut out of cardboard and the dialogue is awful, this might cut the mustard if the film was an out and out action film but it isn't. Instead it is supposed to be a character driven film and thus it is a big problem for it to not have characters or convincing dialogue. Sadly it is a mess in regards the writing and plotting and only the forgiving will find the material worth two hours of their time.\n\nThe action is pretty weak. I didn't think any of the races were exciting and although they are well done, all of them could have sorely used the emotions of the characters to feed into them. As it is the failure of the plot means that much of the film is lacking and feels rather pointless. Occasionally it hints at depth and humanity but the occasional spark is totally drowned out in a sea of noise. The music video goals of the film are met but personally I'm glad not to be in the demographic sector that is tricked into thinking that this makes for a good film.\n\nThe cast are mixed, containing people that I expected better from and people that deserve stuff like this. Fishburne may well have expected more from the film because at times you can see him reaching, sadly he cannot achieve the impossible and any glimmer of a good performance is swamped. Luke struggles from the start. He is pretty and charismatic here but he can't deliver emotion and understanding that isn't in the script and his narration is terrible. The support cast are roundly average with obvious performances from Jones, Hounsou, Fehr and others. Good is sexy but pretty vacant while I'm not sure why Bonet bothered to turn up for so little.\n\nOverall then a fairly pointless film that shrugs off any character potential it may have had in favour of MTV visuals, clunky dialogue and mostly average performances at best.

And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody.

The best 3D to date","reviewBody":"Saw it today in a sneak preview today at the Director's Guild in LA. James Cameron who was there professed it's a masterpiece and the best 3D to date. And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":315454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-11-23","keywords":"cinema,automaton,clock,mechanical man,memory","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2781978137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in 1930s Paris, an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.

Lee Daniels second feature film shows vast improvement over the messy Shadowboxer starring Cuba good Jr. His grasp of the material and dedication to have the story be told is evident in his attention to translate the novel to screen.

She shines in her first starring role and it's no walk in the park for her. The role demanded talent and Sidibe delivers what is needed. Of course the one who stands out the most is Mo'Nique earning herself a much deserved Oscar for her role as the abusive and sloth ridden mother. Her confrontation with her daughter after the birth of the second child is intense and will have you holding your breath in fear for the safety of the child. \n\nPrecious is a film that is driven by a strong story and an emotional cast that cares about the work they are doing. It's a glimmer of hope that keeps the story moving in a world that is hard edged and usually leads nowhere. It's not a relatively long film, but I did find myself checking my watch every now and then and some bits in the film happen without much clarification. Where did that one white boy come from in her Each One Teach One class? In any event, the final product is a good film with a message about hope and Tyler Perry finally has his name attached to something good in his career (Star Trek not included).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-11-20","keywords":"lesbian couple,lesbian,f rated,self narration,mother daughter conflict","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1522402585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTg2OTA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA3MDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTg2OTA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA3MDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Harlem, an overweight, illiterate teen (Sidibe) who is pregnant with her second child is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can head in a new direction."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2829737/","name":"Gabourey Sidibe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0594898/","name":"Mo'Nique"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745736/","name":"Paula Patton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200005/","name":"Lee Daniels"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048235/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0223834/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2819316/","name":"Geoffrey Fletcher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2497119/","name":"Sapphire"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One more good comedy for their list. I don't understand people saying this film is bad, cruel or something. This film is great, has a lot of funny moments, terrific cast and a rocking soundtrack. Who wants more than 1 hour and a half of pure fun, laughs and weird moments. The story is simple: Eddie (Ben Stiller) is a bachelor who finds what seems to be the perfect girl. He marries her only to find that she's a living nightmare. Later, he meets another girl and wind up falling in love with her. That's where the fun begins when he gets into a terrible mess with his wife and his new affair. The film is not politically correct, but fun don't have to be correct. Fun is fun and is meant to make you laugh and the film truly deliver the goods. If you are too moral about wedding, loyalty, good manners, please don't see this movie cause you probably will not like it. The ending really surprised me. I thought it was going to be something like sweet and warm.

One more good comedy for their list. I don't understand people saying this film is bad, cruel or something. This film is great, has a lot of funny moments, terrific cast and a rocking soundtrack. Who wants more than 1 hour and a half of pure fun, laughs and weird moments. The story is simple: Eddie (Ben Stiller) is a bachelor who finds what seems to be the perfect girl. He marries her only to find that she's a living nightmare. Later, he meets another girl and wind up falling in love with her. That's where the fun begins when he gets into a terrible mess with his wife and his new affair. The film is not politically correct, but fun don't have to be correct. Fun is fun and is meant to make you laugh and the film truly deliver the goods. If you are too moral about wedding, loyalty, good manners, please don't see this movie cause you probably will not like it. The ending really surprised me. I thought it was going to be something like sweet and warm. Instead, we have a real life, non-moral type of ending.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89705,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-11-21","keywords":"marriage,dysfunctional marriage,sporting goods store,resort,humorous sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Heartbreak Kid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3220373785","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRhYWFlZTYtMGViYS00OWUyLThkMDktYzI5N2NmM2U5Y2QzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRhYWFlZTYtMGViYS00OWUyLThkMDktYzI5N2NmM2U5Y2QzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Mariachi Band","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157358/","name":"Michelle Monaghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0015196/","name":"Malin Akerman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125803/","name":"Bobby Farrelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268380/","name":"Peter Farrelly"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0035905/","name":"Scot Armstrong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0228908/","name":"Leslie Dixon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125803/","name":"Bobby Farrelly"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He needs to find a mysterious one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged man to get to the truth of the crime, all the while trying to hide from the pursuing authorities.\n\nAs with any Nielson spoofs, there are non-stop gags from start to finish that will have you horse-laughing.

It's so vulgar it makes you puke.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Seeing it, there are no regrets watching it but at the same time it was a little frustrating. It is an interesting and decent film, but had real potential to be a great one and could have been much more.\n\nMatt Damon is a charismatic presence and commands the film with ease without ever trying too hard. Emily Blunt has a genuine winning charm as one often finds with Blunt, her character is not quite as interesting as Damon's but Blunt makes it work. The two have great chemistry together, it really sparkles. In fact it is the romance that comes off the best and most consistently, being where 'The Adjustment Bureau' really comes alive. Anthony Mackie is suitably mysterious while also quite likable in the film's latter stages.\n\nJohn Slattery really looks the part and has a lot of fun in a suitably shady role while Terence Stamp brings some sinister dignity and authority to a rather severely underwritten character that appears in the film too late somewhat. On the acting front, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is very good.\n\nAs it is too with the way it's made, suitably gritty and slick with some inventive moments and an audacious style. The locations are chosen well and used cleverly. The music score has a good mix of understatement and thrilling pulsation. The first half has a lot of very interesting and smart ideas that leaves one gripped enough to carry on and see further how it goes and there is a good deal of fun and a few suspenseful jolts to be had.\n\nFor all those great things, 'The Adjustment Bureau' would have been an even better film if it had done more with the premise. The romance is the most well done and memorable element of it and the rest doesn't live up. It's intriguing and entertaining, but the second half suffers from playing it too safe and having too many ideas needing to be tied up, meaning that potentially great ideas are not fully expanded upon (even the whole basic premise doesn't feel fully cooked).\n\nPacing does get stodgy, as a result of the lack of risk-taking and struggles with keeping things probable and consistent. Despite the conflict being well performed the threat feels lacking because it is handled in a way that's under-cooked and somewhat repetitive which dilutes the suspense quite badly. The more under-explored 'The Adjustment Bureau' gets, the more confusing, tonally muddled and far-fetched it gets too. This is especially true with the ending, which to me is down there with the decade's "what the heck" film endings.\n\nOverall, has a lot to recommend but there was a lot more to the film that never fully emerged. 6/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Romance","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-03-16","keywords":"fate,free will,political superpower,new york,usa","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Adjustment Bureau -- Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2215418393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTE3ODMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTE3ODMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Adjustment Bureau -- Super Bowl Spot\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2564974/","name":"Lisa Thoreson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194736/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177587/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.
