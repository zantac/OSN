Cannot judge which one is better","reviewBody":"Finally saw LITTLE WOMEN 2019. Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).\n\nTwo things really grabbed me.\n\n1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Soon enough, the movie developed its cult fan base. In the end, I find the original "Fright Night" to be one of the most underrated horror films of the 80's.\n\nFrankly, I was actually quite excited for this remake, knowing that it had a great cast and Marti Noxon(who commonly wrote for "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") was at the helm of the script. I personally don't mind remakes. Some people take them way too seriously. Of course, there are some that fail, but a lot of them work really well. The 2011 edition of "Fright Night" works! \n\nSet in a beautiful suburban area of Las Vegas, the movie introduces us to Charley Brewster, a nerdy but charismatic teenager who we find out has given up his relationship with his friend "Evil" Ed to be with the cooler kids, including his hot new girlfriend Amy. Then he meets Jerry Dandrige, a buff, sweet new neighbor that Charley's mom and Amy take a liking to. When Ed tries to warn Charley of Jerry's hidden, and gruesome, intentions, things take a turn for the worse. More people wind up missing, and it becomes evident to Charley that Jerry is a vampire. Nobody believes him before it's too late, and it's up to him and Hard Rock celebrity Peter Vincent to kill this sucker(pun intended) once and for all.\n\nWhile it pays so much respect to the original movie, "Fright Night" also adds a few new elements that elevate it above other remakes. There are some scenes that are lifted right from the original, even two of the original's most classic lines, but the movie breaks several horror movie rules and invents new ones, like whether or not a vampire can come into another person's house.\n\nThe CGI effects in this remake are surprisingly quite good. I didn't see the film in 3D(which I heard doesn't do much for the movie), but in its 2D format, the geysers of blood shoot out magnificently without going over the top, and the makeup is true to the original vampire look in the 1985 film.\n\n"Fright Night" boasts a fantastic cast of well-known actors. Anton Yelchin, as always, does a great job and fits the role of Charley perfectly. Toni Collette stands out as Charley's mother, and Imogen Poots is terrific as Amy. Unlike other horror blonds, the script allows Amy to be smart, and at times brave enough to try to take down Jerry herself. Also, Ms. Poots is an awesome screamer. Christopher Mintz- Plasse is great for the role of "Evil" Ed, and he was born to play that role in this remake. He gets some pretty funny lines and an enjoyable amount of screen time. David Tennant, known for starring in the recent TV revival of "Doctor Who," takes over from Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent, and makes for a funny vision of the character.\n\nAnd then there's Colin Farrell as Jerry. Don't get me wrong. The cast is wonderful. But Farrell eats his role up and nearly steals the show. Sometimes, he doesn't have to do anything, and he still creeps you out. One particular scene in which he has a conversation with Charley sets the character up to be quite fearful. This is not a "Twilight" vampire that Farrell creates. This is a "rip your throat out with no regrets" monster that is impossible not to be freaked out by. Basically, Colin Farrell bathes in his role like the character bathes in human blood.\n\nMarti Noxon's script is clever, funny, and smart, and by the looks of other recent horror outings, it's a script that's better than it should be.\n\nI'll just say that "Fright Night" is not particularly scary. But it's all about the entertainment here. The movie doesn't need to be scary. It's a horror-comedy that allows some good shocks with some great laughs. The original was always on the border of becoming too funny, but it stayed on its feet and kept the horror going. The remake does just that. It's carefully made and done with love for its source material. But otherwise, you can tell that director Craig Gillespie("Lars and the Real Girl"), his cast, and his screenwriter had a ball making this movie. The nostalgia factor is high here, bringing us a combination of both 80's and 90's horror. If you loved "The Lost Boys" and the original 1985 flick, you will surprisingly love 2011's "Fright Night." I welcome it with open arms, and I'm glad I got to see it. Welcome to Fright Night...FOR REAL! \n\nP.S. For those of you who saw the original, you get an unbelievable cameo.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2011-08-19","keywords":"vampire,neighbor,remake,suburb,magician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi341875993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTA1MDcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyOTgyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTA1MDcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyOTgyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teenager Charley Brewster (Yelchin) guesses that his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige (Farrell) is a vampire responsible for a string of recent deaths.

So why bother complaining. After all it's a prequel of a sequel of a movie that was a re-make of a movie that was made in the 30's. But it's well made and loads of fun so just go along with it and you'll enjoy.\n\nFilmed in Panavision the DVD is in perfect 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with very loud and thrilling Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. The extras are fluff, but that's to be expected.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134153,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-04-19","keywords":"sorceress,desert,king,showdown,shared universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104526/","name":"Steven Brand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003817/","name":"Michael Clarke Duncan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751080/","name":"Chuck Russell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075836/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355054/","name":"Jonathan Hales","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651758/","name":"William Osborne"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Danny escapes his troubles in the adrenaline-pumping fantasies of the cinema, especially the JACK SLATER film series.\n\nThe JACK SLATER movies spoof the action franchises popular at the time, like DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON. Jack Slater is the ultimate badass, working for the LAPD but doing things his own way. Chomping on cigars, kicking down doors. Going where other cops wouldn't dare.\n\nIn the film, the star of the JACK SLATER series is real-world action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is LAST ACTION HERO's biggest meta concept as Schwarzenegger stars as a parody of himself (playing both Arnold and Arnold-as-Jack).\n\nWith the help of an enchanted ticket given to Nick by the famed escape artist Harry Houdini, Danny is able to enter the world of the newest JACK SLATER movie and help Jack beat the bad guys. It should be a dream come true, but instead of just going along with it, Danny tries to shatter Jack's worldview by proving that he "lives" in a fictional movie universe, full of improbable explosions, predictable one-liners, and physics-defying stunts. Danny calls out Jack for using well-known Arnold catchphrases like "I'll be back" and tries to explain the absurdity of Jack's LAPD colleague being an animated anthropomorphic cat (voiced by Danny DeVito). Jack thinks Danny's crazy (obviously), but Danny's uncanny knowledge of secret information (gleaned from watching prior installments of the JACK SLATER series, as well as the opening scenes from this one) gets him assigned as Jack's partner, in true buddy movie fashion.\n\nDanny is always completely self-aware about being the comic sidekick in an action movie. He knows Jack Slater's world is governed by plot contrivances and movie clichés. He even calls out the villain for monologuing. Austin O'Brien doesn't do a bad job in the film, but he does start to get on my nerves a little.\n\nThe fun really starts once the villain (Charles Dance) gets ahold of the magic ticket and enters the real world, a place where heroes can bleed and bad guys can actually win. Jack and Danny track him to the star-studded premiere of JACK SLATER IV, where fictional hero Jack Slater comes face-to-face with Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger (among other fun celebrity cameos).\n\nThe satire of LAST ACTION HERO is on-point. Besides getting Arnold Schwarzenegger to spoof himself, the movie is directed by John McTiernan, who directed DIE HARD (1988), and the screenplay was co-written by Shane Black, who wrote LETHAL WEAPON (1987). The top-notch pedigree surely helps sell the film's high concept.\n\nThe script has a lot of potential for the right actor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger seems like he's having a lot of fun with the material. It wouldn't be the same without a real A-list action star playing Jack Slater. Arnold has a good sense of humor about himself and seems to enjoy playing with his image.\n\nOne of the best in-jokes for serious movie buffs comes early in the film when Danny's English teacher, played by Joan Plowright, introduces a clip from Laurence Olivier's HAMLET (1948), suggesting that the students might know the British acting legend from his late-career role of Zeus in CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) or an older TV commercial for Polaroid. Plowright is, of course, Olivier's widow.\n\nIn addition to HAMLET, the movie includes nods to Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957), Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA_(1992), and WITNESS (1985) with Harrison Ford. In the movie world Danny warns Jack not to trust his FBI buddy John Practice because he is played by F. Murray Abraham, the guy who "killed Mozart" (an allusion to AMADEUS (1984)). A Humphrey Bogart-type detective in a trench coat appears in one of the JACK SLATER police station scenes. And since "Arnold Schwarzenegger" can't exist in the fictional world of Jack Slater, his famous role in the TERMINATOR films is played instead by Sylvester Stallone.\n\nThe JACK SLATER action is hilariously over-the-top and stylized, satirizing Hollywood action blockbusters and further contrasting the fantasy world of the silver screen with the real world Danny knows. The original story, developed by Zak Penn and Adam Leff, is quite clever and the film, unconventional as it is, succeeds because of its uniqueness. The movie's a lot of fun and there are plenty of Easter eggs for hardcore cinephiles."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1993-06-18","keywords":"villain,taxi,funeral,video store,child drives a car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Last Action Hero","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1823080729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlMTc2NWMtZTMyNy00MWJjLWFjMTAtZGRmMjQ4ODAwYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlMTc2NWMtZTMyNy00MWJjLWFjMTAtZGRmMjQ4ODAwYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000719/","name":"F.

Taking place shortly after World War I, Van Damme plays Chris Dubois, a humble indentured servant figure with Rocky-like ambitions to become a big fighting champion. Dubois has set his sights on some very elite and secret tournament in some mystical forbidden city, to which only the best fighter in every country of the world gets an invitation.\n\nTo get into the tournament, Dubois enlists the help of a mischievous figure, Lord Dobbs. In one of the many parts of the plot I was unable to follow, Lord Dobbs owes him some unknown favor so he buys his freedom and makes arrangements to get the kid to Beijing, with the aide of an attractive blonde newspaper editor, Carrie Newton (Gunn).\n\nDobbs is played by seven-time James Bond alumni Roger Moore, who I'm so used to seeing as Bond that I half-expected him to, at a crucial point in the movie, bag the attractive news lady, beat someone up, or use some cool gadget. Sadly, Moore only accomplishes one of these three things (uses a cool gadget) and fails miserably at it. However, Moore does carry one James Bond-like trait to this part which is being a smooth talker which gets Dubois in trouble in the first place. Apparently, Dubois was never really entered into the tournament, so he must win over the guy who's slated to fight for the U.S. and get his invitation, which raises the question, isn't Dubois French?\n\nAnyway, there's no reason to fret over little things like that, because considering the plot is secondary to the action, it's pretty well-thought out, and besides the action doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe tournament where most of the actions scenes come from is probably my favorite thing about the movie because the single elimination bracketed format has the same thrill as watching something like NCAA's March Madness. The only difference is that except for rooting for your favorite colleges, you root for Industrial Era superpowers. The other plus of this was that the clashing of such a diverse array of fighting styles (sumo wrestling, Scottish fist fighting, Brazillian street fighting, and the like) led to some great action scenes.\n\nMy main complaint about the action is that Van Damme's fight scenes attempt to create suspense by him being knocked down and then supposedly against our expectations, getting back up and winning. This just becomes predictable, and besides, because the Master of Ceremonies usually hits the gong after a guy gets knocked down, Dubois would have realistically been out in the second round after getting the crap beat out of him by the Spaniard. Even if he did get back up, he wouldn't have been able to overpower the other guy after having taken so many hits. If he is such a skillful fighter, why doesn't he just win the fight efficiently without all the drama? He reminds me of the present-day LA Lakers who slack off the entire regular season, knowing that they only really have to work during the playoffs.\n\nThis gag would have been an effective if it was restricted to only happening in the film's climatic finale. Instead, to top the earlier fights, the tournament's final match really got to be a disappointment. The master of ceremonies was incredibly generous with the gong, deciding to let the fight continue even after Dubois got knocked down twice and kicked out of the ring, where he is beaten up some more and magically throws in a couple kicks at the right moment and walks away with the medallion.\n\nAnyway, the film is a decently played out story that has its moments.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-04-26","keywords":"martial arts tournament,orphan,golden dragon,lost city,slow motion scene","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086487/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003583/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245235/","name":"Frank Dux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12026427/","name":"Steven Klein"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, Moore does carry one James Bond-like trait to this part which is being a smooth talker which gets Dubois in trouble in the first place. Apparently, Dubois was never really entered into the tournament, so he must win over the guy who's slated to fight for the U.S. and get his invitation, which raises the question, isn't Dubois French?\n\nAnyway, there's no reason to fret over little things like that, because considering the plot is secondary to the action, it's pretty well-thought out, and besides the action doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe tournament where most of the actions scenes come from is probably my favorite thing about the movie because the single elimination bracketed format has the same thrill as watching something like NCAA's March Madness. The only difference is that except for rooting for your favorite colleges, you root for Industrial Era superpowers. The other plus of this was that the clashing of such a diverse array of fighting styles (sumo wrestling, Scottish fist fighting, Brazillian street fighting, and the like) led to some great action scenes.\n\nMy main complaint about the action is that Van Damme's fight scenes attempt to create suspense by him being knocked down and then supposedly against our expectations, getting back up and winning. This just becomes predictable, and besides, because the Master of Ceremonies usually hits the gong after a guy gets knocked down, Dubois would have realistically been out in the second round after getting the crap beat out of him by the Spaniard. Even if he did get back up, he wouldn't have been able to overpower the other guy after having taken so many hits. If he is such a skillful fighter, why doesn't he just win the fight efficiently without all the drama? He reminds me of the present-day LA Lakers who slack off the entire regular season, knowing that they only really have to work during the playoffs.\n\nThis gag would have been an effective if it was restricted to only happening in the film's climatic finale. Instead, to top the earlier fights, the tournament's final match really got to be a disappointment. The master of ceremonies was incredibly generous with the gong, deciding to let the fight continue even after Dubois got knocked down twice and kicked out of the ring, where he is beaten up some more and magically throws in a couple kicks at the right moment and walks away with the medallion.\n\nAnyway, the film is a decently played out story that has its moments.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-04-26","keywords":"martial arts tournament,orphan,golden dragon,lost city,slow motion scene","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086487/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003583/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245235/","name":"Frank Dux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12026427/","name":"Steven Klein"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Aiding him is imprisoned forensic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0289765/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"mattrochman"},"dateCreated":"2006-07-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"Another great film that slipped under the radar of most","reviewBody":"This was a fantastic film, but it slipped under many people's radar for three reasons: \n\n1) The critics said (and rightly so) that it is not as good as the Silence of the Lambs. However, I find it difficult to compare the films, largely because Will Graham (Norton) is completely different to Clarice Starling (Foster). The different dimension they bring to the investigation is enough, by itself, to distinguish them beyond comparison.\n\n2) This was the third film in the series. The problem with the Hollywood pumping out an absurd number of sequels and prequels (even when the original film was terrible to begin with) is that it alters the public's attitude towards them. People are usually happy to see the "part 2" but beyond that, you're usually down to loyalists. In fact, this situation has been made worse due to the fact that many of the sequels made are shockingly bad (eg, the American Pie sequels, the Highlander sequels). Some are so terrible that they can actually tarnish the memory of the original (eg... Matrix Revolutions). So a third Hannibal film was always going to be an uphill battle. \n\n3) This followed an awful sequel: Hannibal. People who thought Hannibal was terrible (and there's no shortage of them) are likely to turn their nose up at any further sequels or prequels. That's what Hollywood always overlooks - once you pump out one bad sequel (eg, Ocean's Twelve 2004), fewer people will even consider seeing the next sequel, unless it receives almost unanimous critical acclaim.\n\nI did not like Hannibal either and I think that many stars in Hollywood would have turned it down after reading the script. Jodie Foster, with the offer of reprising her academy awarding winning role, and Jon Demme (director of Silence of the lambs) walked away from the Hannibal after disagreements with author (Harris) over the character directions. Hopkins nearly left when Foster and Demme walked, but was persuaded to stay (probably with a nice salary increase!). In any case, key elements were gone and in my view, they ultimately failed to attract a strong supporting cast. \n\nBy contrast, I think many actors would have been falling over themselves to land one of the roles in Red Dragon after reading the script. Accordingly, we ended up with Hopkins (reprising his academy award winning role to absolute perfection), Norton (who is the rightful winner of the academy award for American History X in my view, even though the academy went to someone else that year), Harvey Keitel, Ralph Finnes and the brilliant, but under-rated, Phillip Seymore Hoffman. They combine to breath tremendous life into this investigative/thriller. And the opening 5 minutes is magnificent.\n\nHowever, I have two criticisms that cost it a star. First, it wasn't quite dark enough. Perhaps that masterpiece, the Silence of the Lambs, used up all the visceral attributes that were so pathetically contrived in Hannibal and present, but not powerfully present, in Red Dragon. There certainly was a dark edge, but it just didn't get under my skin the way Silence of the Lambs did (if you'll forgive the pun). \n\nSecond, I felt that there were a few off-shoots to the main plot that could have been worked around or seemed to play no real role in the film whatsoever.

Aiding him is imprisoned forensic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0289765/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"mattrochman","dateCreated":"2006-07-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"Another great film that slipped under the radar of most","reviewBody":"This was a fantastic film, but it slipped under many people's radar for three reasons: \n\n1) The critics said (and rightly so) that it is not as good as the Silence of the Lambs. However, I find it difficult to compare the films, largely because Will Graham (Norton) is completely different to Clarice Starling (Foster). The different dimension they bring to the investigation is enough, by itself, to distinguish them beyond comparison.\n\n2) This was the third film in the series. The problem with the Hollywood pumping out an absurd number of sequels and prequels (even when the original film was terrible to begin with) is that it alters the public's attitude towards them. People are usually happy to see the "part 2" but beyond that, you're usually down to loyalists. In fact, this situation has been made worse due to the fact that many of the sequels made are shockingly bad (eg, the American Pie sequels, the Highlander sequels). Some are so terrible that they can actually tarnish the memory of the original (eg... Matrix Revolutions). So a third Hannibal film was always going to be an uphill battle. \n\n3) This followed an awful sequel: Hannibal. People who thought Hannibal was terrible (and there's no shortage of them) are likely to turn their nose up at any further sequels or prequels. That's what Hollywood always overlooks - once you pump out one bad sequel (eg, Ocean's Twelve 2004), fewer people will even consider seeing the next sequel, unless it receives almost unanimous critical acclaim.\n\nI did not like Hannibal either and I think that many stars in Hollywood would have turned it down after reading the script. Jodie Foster, with the offer of reprising her academy awarding winning role, and Jon Demme (director of Silence of the lambs) walked away from the Hannibal after disagreements with author (Harris) over the character directions. Hopkins nearly left when Foster and Demme walked, but was persuaded to stay (probably with a nice salary increase!). In any case, key elements were gone and in my view, they ultimately failed to attract a strong supporting cast. \n\nBy contrast, I think many actors would have been falling over themselves to land one of the roles in Red Dragon after reading the script. Accordingly, we ended up with Hopkins (reprising his academy award winning role to absolute perfection), Norton (who is the rightful winner of the academy award for American History X in my view, even though the academy went to someone else that year), Harvey Keitel, Ralph Finnes and the brilliant, but under-rated, Phillip Seymore Hoffman. They combine to breath tremendous life into this investigative/thriller. And the opening 5 minutes is magnificent.\n\nHowever, I have two criticisms that cost it a star. First, it wasn't quite dark enough. Perhaps that masterpiece, the Silence of the Lambs, used up all the visceral attributes that were so pathetically contrived in Hannibal and present, but not powerfully present, in Red Dragon. There certainly was a dark edge, but it just didn't get under my skin the way Silence of the Lambs did (if you'll forgive the pun). \n\nSecond, I felt that there were a few off-shoots to the main plot that could have been worked around or seemed to play no real role in the film whatsoever. For example, the tense relationship between Norton and the reporter (Hoffman), Finnes taking the blind girl to listen to the sedated tiger (or lion or whatever it was), Norton teaching his wife to shoot ... and many others. Most of the time, I felt that they should have been left on the cutting room floor as they were of little interest, had little (if any) role in the context of the story and accordingly, unnecessarily bulked out the running time of the film.\n\nOtherwise, terrific viewing. Don't be dissuaded by Hannibal - this sequel achieves where that one so dismally failed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262153,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-12-11","keywords":"fbi agent,criminal profile,blindness,tabloid reporter,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Red Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi848298265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1ZWZmODktZGJjOS00ZGMyLWI3MzYtYmExZTRmMTJkM2UyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1ZWZmODktZGJjOS00ZGMyLWI3MzYtYmExZTRmMTJkM2UyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0711840/","name":"Brett Ratner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848217/","name":"Ted Tally"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film is much better than say other films set in London with Urban theme's like 'Breaking and Entering'. A film well worth having a look at when or if it gets a UK Theatrical release.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-08-24","keywords":"bully,beating,male full back nudity,bare butt,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sugarhouse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2882863897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDA2Mjg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzNTMyMg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDA2Mjg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzNTMyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Movie Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533599/","name":"Steven Mackintosh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910180/","name":"Ashley Walters","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0522327/","name":"Gary Love"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009090/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0187060/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2364947/","name":"Dominic Leyton"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Granted, few teen movies are designed to treat their subjects with any degree of seriousness. And of all the film genres, horror is kept alive with only the slightest bit of effort, accompanied by even slighter expectations. But director David Nutter tackles both these obstacles in a rare attempt to sophisticate Hollywood's offerings to teen audiences and bring dignity to the maligned horror genre. Despite a screenplay written contrary to his vision, Nutter succeeds in creating a dramatic, moody, and entertaining sci-fi/horror yarn far more difficult to dismiss than its contemporary equivalents. That is, until MGM destroyed it.\n\nIt's important to note that the version of Disturbing Behavior being analyzed here is the director's cut, which is not the version released in theaters. Nutter's cut isn't available commercially, but if you watch the DVD's considerable amount of deleted footage and the original ending, you can see just how devastating the studio's changes were. \n\nAfter suffering the loss of his older brother, Steve and his family relocate to Cradle Bay, where some of the kids at school aren't quite themselves these days. With the help of friends Rachel (Katie Holmes) and Gavin (Nick Stahl), Steve discovers that a local doctor, Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood), is conspiring with parents to lobotomize their teens in order to create "good boys and girls", all of whom become members of the school's Blue Ribbon elitist clique. Caldicott's experiments prevent the Blue Ribbons from sexual impulses and mold them into academic achievers that spend a great deal of their time trying to recruit others to "the program". Unfortunately, the experiments don't always work and trouble is at hand, especially when Steve's parents sign him up.\n\nScott Rosenberg, the screenwriter of the film, later expressed great disappointment with Nutter's handling of the material. Rosenberg, the screenwriter of Con-Air and Beautiful Girls, never intended his script to be treated as dramatically or realistically as Nutter executed it. Instead, it was supposed to be more "hip" and "cool", allegedly without being mired down by characterization or atmosphere. This seems to indicate that the screenwriter, like the studio executives, had low ambitions with the material, planning to do nothing more than churn out another cheap horror film that insults the intelligence of its target audience. \n\nDavid Nutter, a veteran director of The X-Files, saw the potential in Rosenberg's script and acted on it. He started by casting three of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. James Marsden breaks the stereotype that models can't be good actors by delivering a subtle, restrained performance as Steve. Katie Holmes has a few opportunities to demonstrate her abilities as well. As the socially outcast Rachel, Holmes combines a defensive posture with an underlying desire to connect. Nick Stahl has the meatiest part, playing the cynical Gavin, a critic of all the other cliques at school. Gavin's quiet omnipotence is colored by a dry sense of humor much needed in the film. Other notable performances include William Sadler as Newberry, the school's janitor. Newberry is a little off kilter, squinting, grumbling, and hell-bent on ridding the world of all rats. Another interesting character who almost steals the show is U.V. (Chad E. Donella), Gavin's reticent albino friend who spends most of the film sitting at Gavin's side and uttering only a few syllables. \n\nNutter's style is very much the signature X-Files style, dark, steamy, creepy, and purposeful. To achieve this, Nutter enlisted an X-Files photographer (John S. Bartley), the X-Files composer (Mark Snow), several X-Files actors (including Steve Railsback, aka Duane Barry), and key production personnel. The result is a movie that feels like an X-Files spin-off, with a subdued ambiance that washes over you and gets under your skin. Nutter commissioned one of the more remarkable opening title sequences in recent film history, one that serves as a cinematic prelude to the lobotomy procedure later in the film - a rapidly-edited montage of happy images and words designed to hypnotize and brainwash Caldicott's victims. \n\nIf Disturbing Behavior should be criticized, it certainly loses points in its third act, one that falls dangerously close to cliché, with Steve becoming more the archetypal hero figure in a predictable and unimaginative showdown with Caldicott and the Blue Ribbons. Since the third act of any story is largely plot (character development is usually pretty well wrapped-up by then), I imagine Nutter had little to work with from Rosenberg's original screenplay. That the first two acts were so emotionally engaging is the result of Nutter's persistence and better judgment. It's too bad that MGM freaked out after a test screening in Texas and thought they could improve their numbers by shortening the film and forcing it into the cookie-cutter shape of the average, low-achieving horror flick. \n\nI champion this film because of its thematic content and its ideology. Like many of my favorite films (RoboCop, Dances with Wolves, Rebel Without a Cause), it deals with characters in crises of identity, trying to become or remain whole, and connect with each other. Equally interesting to me are the notions of sexual repression as a sign of perfection, man playing God, parents' willingness to medically alter their children, and human unwillingness to face loss. Nutter's bold vision for this material, his ability to cull it from a screenplay where it was not just dormant, but banished, makes his director's cut a remarkable achievement. Add in the exemplary performances of Marsden, Stahl, and Holmes, and that special X-Files flare, and I've got something I can really sink my teeth into. - Scott Schirmer","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1998-07-24","keywords":"high school,stepford wives plot,grocery store,fellatio,teenage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Disturbing Behavior","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1102757657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEyNDIzYTktNzRhYi00NGZkLWEwZDMtM2RkN2UwMDUyNmM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEyNDIzYTktNzRhYi00NGZkLWEwZDMtM2RkN2UwMDUyNmM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005188/","name":"James Marsden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005017/","name":"Katie Holmes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001763/","name":"Nick Stahl"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0638354/","name":"David Nutter"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050640/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Taking place shortly after World War I, Van Damme plays Chris Dubois, a humble indentured servant figure with Rocky-like ambitions to become a big fighting champion. Dubois has set his sights on some very elite and secret tournament in some mystical forbidden city, to which only the best fighter in every country of the world gets an invitation.\n\nTo get into the tournament, Dubois enlists the help of a mischievous figure, Lord Dobbs. In one of the many parts of the plot I was unable to follow, Lord Dobbs owes him some unknown favor so he buys his freedom and makes arrangements to get the kid to Beijing, with the aide of an attractive blonde newspaper editor, Carrie Newton (Gunn).\n\nDobbs is played by seven-time James Bond alumni Roger Moore, who I'm so used to seeing as Bond that I half-expected him to, at a crucial point in the movie, bag the attractive news lady, beat someone up, or use some cool gadget. Sadly, Moore only accomplishes one of these three things (uses a cool gadget) and fails miserably at it. However, Moore does carry one James Bond-like trait to this part which is being a smooth talker which gets Dubois in trouble in the first place. Apparently, Dubois was never really entered into the tournament, so he must win over the guy who's slated to fight for the U.S. and get his invitation, which raises the question, isn't Dubois French?\n\nAnyway, there's no reason to fret over little things like that, because considering the plot is secondary to the action, it's pretty well-thought out, and besides the action doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe tournament where most of the actions scenes come from is probably my favorite thing about the movie because the single elimination bracketed format has the same thrill as watching something like NCAA's March Madness. The only difference is that except for rooting for your favorite colleges, you root for Industrial Era superpowers. The other plus of this was that the clashing of such a diverse array of fighting styles (sumo wrestling, Scottish fist fighting, Brazillian street fighting, and the like) led to some great action scenes.\n\nMy main complaint about the action is that Van Damme's fight scenes attempt to create suspense by him being knocked down and then supposedly against our expectations, getting back up and winning. This just becomes predictable, and besides, because the Master of Ceremonies usually hits the gong after a guy gets knocked down, Dubois would have realistically been out in the second round after getting the crap beat out of him by the Spaniard. Even if he did get back up, he wouldn't have been able to overpower the other guy after having taken so many hits. If he is such a skillful fighter, why doesn't he just win the fight efficiently without all the drama? He reminds me of the present-day LA Lakers who slack off the entire regular season, knowing that they only really have to work during the playoffs.\n\nThis gag would have been an effective if it was restricted to only happening in the film's climatic finale. Instead, to top the earlier fights, the tournament's final match really got to be a disappointment. The master of ceremonies was incredibly generous with the gong, deciding to let the fight continue even after Dubois got knocked down twice and kicked out of the ring, where he is beaten up some more and magically throws in a couple kicks at the right moment and walks away with the medallion.\n\nAnyway, the film is a decently played out story that has its moments.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-04-26","keywords":"martial arts tournament,orphan,golden dragon,lost city,slow motion scene","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086487/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003583/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245235/","name":"Frank Dux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12026427/","name":"Steven Klein"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Taking place shortly after World War I, Van Damme plays Chris Dubois, a humble indentured servant figure with Rocky-like ambitions to become a big fighting champion. Dubois has set his sights on some very elite and secret tournament in some mystical forbidden city, to which only the best fighter in every country of the world gets an invitation.\n\nTo get into the tournament, Dubois enlists the help of a mischievous figure, Lord Dobbs. In one of the many parts of the plot I was unable to follow, Lord Dobbs owes him some unknown favor so he buys his freedom and makes arrangements to get the kid to Beijing, with the aide of an attractive blonde newspaper editor, Carrie Newton (Gunn).\n\nDobbs is played by seven-time James Bond alumni Roger Moore, who I'm so used to seeing as Bond that I half-expected him to, at a crucial point in the movie, bag the attractive news lady, beat someone up, or use some cool gadget. Sadly, Moore only accomplishes one of these three things (uses a cool gadget) and fails miserably at it. However, Moore does carry one James Bond-like trait to this part which is being a smooth talker which gets Dubois in trouble in the first place. Apparently, Dubois was never really entered into the tournament, so he must win over the guy who's slated to fight for the U.S. and get his invitation, which raises the question, isn't Dubois French?\n\nAnyway, there's no reason to fret over little things like that, because considering the plot is secondary to the action, it's pretty well-thought out, and besides the action doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe tournament where most of the actions scenes come from is probably my favorite thing about the movie because the single elimination bracketed format has the same thrill as watching something like NCAA's March Madness. The only difference is that except for rooting for your favorite colleges, you root for Industrial Era superpowers. The other plus of this was that the clashing of such a diverse array of fighting styles (sumo wrestling, Scottish fist fighting, Brazillian street fighting, and the like) led to some great action scenes.\n\nMy main complaint about the action is that Van Damme's fight scenes attempt to create suspense by him being knocked down and then supposedly against our expectations, getting back up and winning. This just becomes predictable, and besides, because the Master of Ceremonies usually hits the gong after a guy gets knocked down, Dubois would have realistically been out in the second round after getting the crap beat out of him by the Spaniard. Even if he did get back up, he wouldn't have been able to overpower the other guy after having taken so many hits. If he is such a skillful fighter, why doesn't he just win the fight efficiently without all the drama? He reminds me of the present-day LA Lakers who slack off the entire regular season, knowing that they only really have to work during the playoffs.\n\nThis gag would have been an effective if it was restricted to only happening in the film's climatic finale. Instead, to top the earlier fights, the tournament's final match really got to be a disappointment. The master of ceremonies was incredibly generous with the gong, deciding to let the fight continue even after Dubois got knocked down twice and kicked out of the ring, where he is beaten up some more and magically throws in a couple kicks at the right moment and walks away with the medallion.\n\nAnyway, the film is a decently played out story that has its moments.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-04-26","keywords":"martial arts tournament,orphan,golden dragon,lost city,slow motion scene","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086487/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003583/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245235/","name":"Frank Dux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12026427/","name":"Steven Klein"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She is Morgan Adams : Geena Davis (then Mrs Harlin) who attempts to free a polish , rogue crook : Matthew Modine from slavery and save the life of her father : Harris Yulin at the hands of his brother Henry Morgan : Frank Langella . Her main problem is the map revealing the location has been divided into three pieces . Se only has the first , etched oh her daddy's scalp.

As well as colorful and sunny cinematography by Peter Levy , shot on wonderful locations in Malta and Thailand. Filmmaker Renny Harlin likes lots of blowing up and frenetic action when he does not know what else to do, resulting in an overlong and a little tiring movie . It was a commercial flop that bankrupted the powerful production company Carolco/Mario Kassar . The motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard , Cliffhanger, Hercules, Cleaner , Exorcist the beginning , Mindhunters, Deep Blue sea , Long Kiss goodnight , Driven , 12 Rounds , 5 days of War) .

You will laugh and be happy for a change after leaving a movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":224175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2006-11-10","keywords":"author,fate,professor,novelist,writer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stranger Than Fiction","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2710241561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRlZDQ1MjQtMjIwOS00YTE5LTg3MjQtNDU4ZTg1ZmI4MjA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRlZDQ1MjQtMjIwOS00YTE5LTg3MjQtNDU4ZTg1ZmI4MjA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002071/","name":"Will Ferrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286975/","name":"Marc Forster"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142446/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183490/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1590998/","name":"Zach Helm"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

OK. Steven Seagal doesn't care about his fans, he only cares about the money. OK. Steven Seagal is egoistic. OK. I can live with that. But... Steven Seagal REALLY can't act. Like it's something we didn't already know. And acting is a pretty important thing if you're considering yourself an actor. The worst part is that he continues to make movies, terrible movies, and gets away with it, collecting generous paychecks. Only thing that changes is his character's name. The only reason I got this movie 4* is that I was impressed with Jade Yorker's performance and that there were couple of OK fighting scenes, I guess. But man, that kid CAN act, he really show passion and emotions. Why is it so hard for Steven to try and show us some emotions, like he did? Sadness, happiness, compassion etc. He continues to maintain the same facial expression throughout his whole filmography, and that (now that he got old and really obese) irritates me, because I know he can do better, I guess he just doesn't care. He also continues to show his egoism which is pretty visible in the other character's lines.\n\nThe plot for this movie is pretty bad, you can predict almost from the start. I knew who the main "bad guy" was since I first saw him in the movie, and I don't want to know that right away, I want something surprising. Gangs, shooting, money, corrupt cop(s), one woman, car chasing, fight scenes (obviously speeded up and unreal sometimes, especially the "fist in a gunfight" scene)... and that's about it. We saw that a million times ago in cinematography. It tends to get pretty boring. Also, I really didn't like Eddie Griffin's role as Armand Tucker, I thought it was pretty overacted.\n\nFor me, if you really want to see a relatively good Seagal movie made in 21st century, watch Pistol Whipped and Exit Wounds, the only good movies in which he starred since the 1996 and Executive Decision (in which he died, ironically), they were much better altogether, and skip this crap, please. Even if you're a fan. I once considered myself a Seagal fan, but with this ego trips he completely lost my respect for him as an actor and as a human being.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5911,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-11-13","keywords":"police corruption,corruption,corrupt cop,brunette woman,miniskirt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Urban Justice","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3252683033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYzNjVhYWUtNjE2OS00MTNhLWIzZGQtMWZkMjVlMjUzZGE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYzNjVhYWUtNjE2OS00MTNhLWIzZGQtMWZkMjVlMjUzZGE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000219/","name":"Steven Seagal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0341176/","name":"Eddie Griffin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0784831/","name":"Carmen Serano"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005703/","name":"Don E.

That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

In Florence, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) awakens in a hospital with no memory of the last two days and with daydreams and dreadful visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones) explains that he has a head trauma cause by a bullet that scratched his head and he would recover his memory in a few days.

The romance between Langdon and Elizabeth Sinskey, performed by the unknown Sidse Babett Knudsen, has no chemistry. In the end, "Inferno" is absolutely forgettable.

"The Rock" does a moderate job of acting in this movie-but his performance would not win him any awards. I love the fight scene in the beginning against the football team. Overrated and improbable: of course...but it really appeals to the thrill seeker in me for some reason.\n\nSean William Scott plays off The Rock's character very well.

Robert Langdon is a superman since he is wounded and with amnesia, but capable of run, jump over the walls, recalls details such as hidden passages and door in different locations etc. The plot point with Sienna Brooks is totally predictable and it was obvious that she had teamed up with Langdon to find where the virus is. The romance between Langdon and Elizabeth Sinskey, performed by the unknown Sidse Babett Knudsen, has no chemistry. In the end, "Inferno" is absolutely forgettable.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.\n\nI hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matinée price."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191694,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"monster,nuclear explosion,explosion,strong female character,strong female lead","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810380569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Resident Evil: Apocalypse"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347149/","name":"Sienna Guillory"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531095/","name":"Eric Mabius"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936838/","name":"Alexander Witt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032081/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286424/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.\n\nI hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matinée price.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191694,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"monster,nuclear explosion,explosion,strong female character,strong female lead","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810380569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Resident Evil: Apocalypse","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347149/","name":"Sienna Guillory","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531095/","name":"Eric Mabius"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936838/","name":"Alexander Witt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

A Polish-directed/written film set in China with basically an entirely Chinese cast? A bit foreign for me (being from the US), to say the least.\n\nStarting out with the main character Wolski escaping from Russian Siberia into China, you watch as he is taken in by a poor Chinese family consisting of Guo, his wife, and their daughter Song.

Yet it hardly saved the film from it's mediocre direction.

I was hoping it might have been a movie I missed and after realizing what it is I decided to post my comment.\n\nI can't believe how this pathetic movie garnered some awards as it appears to have.

Even the kids are fine, with Ielapi as the titular protagonist, the naive, stubborn but well-meaning Pinocchio, Baldari Calabria as the quietly mischievous young fairy and Di Domenicantonio as toxic friend Lucignolo.\n\nSpecial mention to the excellent make-up and costumes.\n\n7,5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11019,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2019-12-19","keywords":"based on children's book,puppet,marionette,toymaker,role played by multiple actors","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3542466841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3ZGNmYjUtOTY2MS00NjAwLWE1NmQtODkyN2NmNTg5YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3ZGNmYjUtOTY2MS00NjAwLWE1NmQtODkyN2NmNTg5YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Shot in stunning Italian locations, Matteo Garrone's rich world of mystery and wonder stars Academy Award® winning actor Roberto Benigni as Geppetto, the old woodcarver whose puppet creation, Pinocchio, magically comes to life with dreams of becoming a real boy.

And normally I would be inclined to agree with you, but for some reason I still did like this film.\n\nIt contains fantastic acting including Hopkins, albeit certain scenes he may have overacted a tad bit, it's interesting and is enjoyable. In addition it also contains great references albeit not very subtle, the complete opposite of subtle to Psycho and a few other Hitchcock films which work to its advantage in my opinion. I also rather liked the inclusion of Ed Gein and the conversations that took place between him and Hitchcock.\n\nBasically this film will appeal to everyone. But, unfortunately it isn't the film it could have been or should have been, but ultimately it is enjoyable, funny and above all entertaining.

We've seen it before. Two stories, seemingly unrelated, yet parallel. Only this time it's based on a true story, and the 2017 book "All My Tomorrows" by Brian Gregory. Director Lance Hool and co-writers Veronica Hool and Robin U. Russin serve up a touching and inspirational story of how the lives of families can intersect, and how triumph can come from tragedy.\n\nAdmittedly, the film has a bit of Lifetime Movie Channel look and feel. It even begins with some conventional philosophy on life courtesy of our narrator: it's either a miracle or it's not, and life either happens to us or for us. These are neither particularly thought-provoking nor deep, however, they do set the stage well enough for the story. We first see an unconscious Chris Gregory (Jacob Elordi, THE KISSING BOOTH) being wheeled on a gurney into the surgical area of a hospital. His loved ones are obviously concerned.

We've seen it before. Two stories, seemingly unrelated, yet parallel. Only this time it's based on a true story, and the 2017 book "All My Tomorrows" by Brian Gregory. Director Lance Hool and co-writers Veronica Hool and Robin U. Russin serve up a touching and inspirational story of how the lives of families can intersect, and how triumph can come from tragedy.\n\nAdmittedly, the film has a bit of Lifetime Movie Channel look and feel. It even begins with some conventional philosophy on life courtesy of our narrator: it's either a miracle or it's not, and life either happens to us or for us. These are neither particularly thought-provoking nor deep, however, they do set the stage well enough for the story. We first see an unconscious Chris Gregory (Jacob Elordi, THE KISSING BOOTH) being wheeled on a gurney into the surgical area of a hospital. His loved ones are obviously concerned. We then cut to a period many years earlier as a young Cuban boy passes out on a soccer field. We learn Jorge Bolivar has a lung disease, and has been told at various stages that he wouldn't live past 12, 20, or 30 years old.\n\nDespite the different time periods, we see the symmetry with the romantic interests of the men.

But 'Capone' manages that rare feat: it's bleak - but not bleak enough to turn you off, and it's even often entertaining (in terms of its performances, the fantastic score, the beautiful cinematography). But even though this probably wasn't the film's intention, it still manages to be the ultimate deconstruction of the gangster as an "icon" - more so even than Scorsese's 'Irishman' (though it's nowhere near as good a film).\n\nI liked Capone; it's weird (and I guess you shouldn't watch it unless you like profoundly weird little arthouse films) but this is definitely not a badly made film.

What this move does not show is that at that time Attorney General, now deceased Lech Kaczynski had been urged that a killer is found and sentenced to silence medias hysteria and coverage about brutal murder and rape of that young girl. Later when the murder was put on Tomasz, he was publicly defamed by Lech Kaczynski. Despite Mr L. Kaczynski death in Smolensk plane crash and after Tomasz was exonerated, no polish public institution nor police have never apologized Tomasz for their actions, which is a standard practice in western democratic countries.\n\nNot much changed in post-soviet bloc however after 1990 in terms of judiciary mentality. Human Rights Watch estimates that 1-3% of sentences in Poland may be those in which innocent people are sentenced just because either suspects were threatened by police to force to confess by beatings. No effective police control and their procedures exists as of today. You may call it a mafia or not but I believe it's not far from truth in Poland.\n\nPersonally I believe his family did not do enough to get him out of prison, a good lawyer would smash the case easily and he is worth every money, why did it happen 15 years later is a mystery for me.\n\nAs Tomasz said after his release, there are no good people in prisons , there is only evil.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-18","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3825975/","name":"Piotr Trojan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474492/","name":"Agata Kulesza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2621963/","name":"Dariusz Chojnacki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015575/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733303/","name":"Andrzej Golda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What this move does not show is that at that time Attorney General, now deceased Lech Kaczynski had been urged that a killer is found and sentenced to silence medias hysteria and coverage about brutal murder and rape of that young girl. Later when the murder was put on Tomasz, he was publicly defamed by Lech Kaczynski. Despite Mr L. Kaczynski death in Smolensk plane crash and after Tomasz was exonerated, no polish public institution nor police have never apologized Tomasz for their actions, which is a standard practice in western democratic countries.\n\nNot much changed in post-soviet bloc however after 1990 in terms of judiciary mentality. Human Rights Watch estimates that 1-3% of sentences in Poland may be those in which innocent people are sentenced just because either suspects were threatened by police to force to confess by beatings. No effective police control and their procedures exists as of today. You may call it a mafia or not but I believe it's not far from truth in Poland.\n\nPersonally I believe his family did not do enough to get him out of prison, a good lawyer would smash the case easily and he is worth every money, why did it happen 15 years later is a mystery for me.\n\nAs Tomasz said after his release, there are no good people in prisons , there is only evil.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-18","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3825975/","name":"Piotr Trojan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474492/","name":"Agata Kulesza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2621963/","name":"Dariusz Chojnacki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015575/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733303/","name":"Andrzej Golda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Andrzej Jaminowski, 87 m. When Jasiak, a retired school teacher, decides to act as custodian of a deserted farm in the Polish countryside, he finds the easy life more than he bargained for. To begin with, the farm's owners neither want nor need a custodian. Then his solitude is broken by one of his former students, a young girl who's had it with her materialistic parents. And by some con artists, some cyclists, at least one self-proclaimed poet, the girl's parents, the farm's owners, and ultimately the police. So much for lazy-ing around in the hazy countryside. You might call Squint Your Eyes a provocative, philosophical comedy.Nick Salerno","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-10-24","keywords":"farm,ex teacher,rural setting,unemployment,isolation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1437136/","name":"Olga Prószynska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435653/","name":"Rafal Guzniczak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109608/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109606/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Zieja</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 10136434, Title: Zieja, 
 --- Description: Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed.

Write what hurts."","reviewBody":"Some of my favorite films are the ones that don't have much ostensible plot movement at first glance. I like films where characters just meander aimlessly as they work through certain social issues, or reevaluate their place in their own lives, and really, that's what this film is all about. It's about taking a temperature reading in the current political climate and deciding if it's time to make a meaningful and purposeful change in the way we live our lives. Josh (Justin Long, "Drag Me to Hell") is not a bad guy, though he does has his issues; he's a bit self-centered, he thinks he can fix everyone's problems for them and attempts to do so, and sometimes he just won't shut up enough for other people to get a word in. At the same time, Josh is trying. He makes a honest effort to connect with his family as his grandmother lies dying in the hospital, even going out of his way multiple times to try to convince his father (Richard Schiff, "Seven") to visit her, though his relationship with her over the last years has been strained (Grandma is mom's mom and the parents are divorced). Through these sequences we begin to get a sense of who Josh is and what he truly believes, and we also get passing interactions with minor characters that gently play on the import and sometimes uncomfortable social issues and how he as a white, straight, cisgender male plays into those issues. He approaches certain situations with as much gravitas as he can, but in the end, sometimes, he just finds himself at a loss for what to do. Many of the situations Josh finds himself in don't seem to really have an obvious answer as to what truly is 'The Right Thing' to do, and when he feels at a loss he feels as if he needs to fix it, when, in the end, all he really needs to do is listen, understand, and try to sympathize with the people he may have inadvertently hurt or offended. Beyond making a few important points, this film is also really funny. The theater in which I saw this movie was mostly full, and the crowd seemed to absolutely eat the humor up. Most of the jokes arises from uncomfortable or awkward situations, but there are plenty of great character chemistry moments, one liners, jokes that were previously set up and executed flawlessly, and though many of the jokes revolve around hot issues, none of it ever feels forced, crass, or ill-conceived; it feels real and honest. I think the reason I enjoyed this film so much is that it doesn't really claim to have any answers. It just asks that you open your ears and mind to the changing climate, and shut up for a while, at least long enough to hear the other voices and opinions around you. Overall, "Safe Spaces" was a very enjoyable, very 'woke' comedy that feels right at home in 2019.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-15","keywords":"jew,jewish,teacher student relationship,adjunct professor,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"After Class","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1908522777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2547958/","name":"Kate Berlant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169565/","name":"Lynn Cohen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Write what hurts."","reviewBody":"Some of my favorite films are the ones that don't have much ostensible plot movement at first glance. I like films where characters just meander aimlessly as they work through certain social issues, or reevaluate their place in their own lives, and really, that's what this film is all about. It's about taking a temperature reading in the current political climate and deciding if it's time to make a meaningful and purposeful change in the way we live our lives. Josh (Justin Long, "Drag Me to Hell") is not a bad guy, though he does has his issues; he's a bit self-centered, he thinks he can fix everyone's problems for them and attempts to do so, and sometimes he just won't shut up enough for other people to get a word in. At the same time, Josh is trying. He makes a honest effort to connect with his family as his grandmother lies dying in the hospital, even going out of his way multiple times to try to convince his father (Richard Schiff, "Seven") to visit her, though his relationship with her over the last years has been strained (Grandma is mom's mom and the parents are divorced). Through these sequences we begin to get a sense of who Josh is and what he truly believes, and we also get passing interactions with minor characters that gently play on the import and sometimes uncomfortable social issues and how he as a white, straight, cisgender male plays into those issues. He approaches certain situations with as much gravitas as he can, but in the end, sometimes, he just finds himself at a loss for what to do. Many of the situations Josh finds himself in don't seem to really have an obvious answer as to what truly is 'The Right Thing' to do, and when he feels at a loss he feels as if he needs to fix it, when, in the end, all he really needs to do is listen, understand, and try to sympathize with the people he may have inadvertently hurt or offended. Beyond making a few important points, this film is also really funny. The theater in which I saw this movie was mostly full, and the crowd seemed to absolutely eat the humor up. Most of the jokes arises from uncomfortable or awkward situations, but there are plenty of great character chemistry moments, one liners, jokes that were previously set up and executed flawlessly, and though many of the jokes revolve around hot issues, none of it ever feels forced, crass, or ill-conceived; it feels real and honest. I think the reason I enjoyed this film so much is that it doesn't really claim to have any answers. It just asks that you open your ears and mind to the changing climate, and shut up for a while, at least long enough to hear the other voices and opinions around you. Overall, "Safe Spaces" was a very enjoyable, very 'woke' comedy that feels right at home in 2019.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-15","keywords":"jew,jewish,teacher student relationship,adjunct professor,family relationships","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"After Class","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1908522777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2547958/","name":"Kate Berlant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169565/","name":"Lynn Cohen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I can understand JT's attraction to this movie. It starts off as a classic old noir detective show (with JT as the narrator). Quite intriguing standard Maltese Falcon/Raymond Chandler style to begin with light tinges of Get Shorty and Pulp Fiction thrown in. I feel that this may be what attracted both John and Morgan initially. The doe eyed secretary and beautiful, mysterious woman waiting in his office when he escapes from the hitmen sent by (presumably) his bookie for outstanding debts. The lure of the dollars offered and a trip back to his hometown (with the bad memories) offers some interesting plot lines and, indeed, the film shapes up as having some potential. Morgan Freeman is introduced as the evil doer (who knows how he got there??) Then, (OMG THEN!!).....this movie rapidly spirals into self implosion worse than the Simpsons 3d episode!!! Seemingly rushing toward a timeframe ending with Keystone Kop like shootouts, ridiculous and implausible twists and turns and a finale that is blatantly obvious to even the most unobservant viewer (supposed twist at the end easily figured out way earlier!). The acting (from all) towards the end would embarrass a 7th grade school play lead. It seems as though everyone involved just wanted it to end asap (as did I). A real disappointment given that the start was quite good but it is a sad indictment on some of the potentially great actors of our time that, in the twilight of their careers, they are signing on for roles that are not only laughable but ruining their reputations and are certainly below the skillset, experience and expertise that they have achieved through out their long and illustrious professional working life. 3 points for a reasonable beginning, the rest is abysmal.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7867,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"private detective,murder","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Poison Rose","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2402728985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0809942/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209560/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8729010/","name":"Luca Giliberto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0759363/","name":"Richard Salvatore"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I can understand JT's attraction to this movie. It starts off as a classic old noir detective show (with JT as the narrator). Quite intriguing standard Maltese Falcon/Raymond Chandler style to begin with light tinges of Get Shorty and Pulp Fiction thrown in. I feel that this may be what attracted both John and Morgan initially. The doe eyed secretary and beautiful, mysterious woman waiting in his office when he escapes from the hitmen sent by (presumably) his bookie for outstanding debts. The lure of the dollars offered and a trip back to his hometown (with the bad memories) offers some interesting plot lines and, indeed, the film shapes up as having some potential. Morgan Freeman is introduced as the evil doer (who knows how he got there??) Then, (OMG THEN!!).....this movie rapidly spirals into self implosion worse than the Simpsons 3d episode!!! Seemingly rushing toward a timeframe ending with Keystone Kop like shootouts, ridiculous and implausible twists and turns and a finale that is blatantly obvious to even the most unobservant viewer (supposed twist at the end easily figured out way earlier!). The acting (from all) towards the end would embarrass a 7th grade school play lead. It seems as though everyone involved just wanted it to end asap (as did I). A real disappointment given that the start was quite good but it is a sad indictment on some of the potentially great actors of our time that, in the twilight of their careers, they are signing on for roles that are not only laughable but ruining their reputations and are certainly below the skillset, experience and expertise that they have achieved through out their long and illustrious professional working life. 3 points for a reasonable beginning, the rest is abysmal.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7867,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"private detective,murder","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Poison Rose","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2402728985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0809942/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209560/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8729010/","name":"Luca Giliberto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0759363/","name":"Richard Salvatore"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

However it never aspires to be anything else preventing it from becoming a classic amongst the genre.\n\nI haven't been familiar with the true story but from the start, you just know where it is all gonna go. It still works well but nothing is a surprise because of that. It still has some great moments and a fair amount of heart\n\nIt is seriously enjoyable and it is a likeable movie with a great cast.

However it never aspires to be anything else preventing it from becoming a classic amongst the genre.\n\nI haven't been familiar with the true story but from the start, you just know where it is all gonna go. It still works well but nothing is a surprise because of that. It still has some great moments and a fair amount of heart\n\nIt is seriously enjoyable and it is a likeable movie with a great cast.

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

First off, I have never seen an Alexander Payne film, and the story itself sort of seemed like the type of film that would end up on a long list of solid films that end up being unmemorable. Much to my surprise, it has a sort of tone that you don't see often in these types of films.\n\nThis is a film that carefully treads around the edges. I wouldn't say it ever became too sentimental. Yet I also expected a snappy dialogue- filled, fast-paced dramedy, sort of like Reitman's Up in the Air, that other Clooney film. The film is written and plays out like a real life situation. One could maybe try to say that about any film like this, but here it rings true. To say it's slow or fast paced isn't really what matters, but what matters is how much it develops its characters with real richness and detail. In a way, the screenplay is helped a lot by Payne as a director, not because the writing is thin, but because the direction allows the film to feel sort of spontaneous. This isn't a film full of twists or turns, and yet at every corner when you try to analyze it, you realize how unpredictable it all feels. \n\nI have also heard one thing about it in many reviews, and that is how it's messy like life. One can easily read those descriptions and just roll his or her eyes, but that description really holds truth. The film doesn't feel to glamorous or stylized. It certainly isn't the dramedy with witty one liners that I expected. Instead, when it's all over, you take a step back and realize that it all feels sort of messy. It's not complicated, and in fact it's a pretty simple film, but even the editing helps this certain mood that the film leaves you in. It's simple, yet hard to really pinpoint and describe how it all comes together or how it's something of real importance. This is completely refreshing, especially when films these days hammer you with these sort of messages or details.\n\nI now want to talk about the performances, which are stellar. Clooney just won the Globe a couple of hours ago, and now I look at it and think to myself "wow... of all of his performances, this is getting him awards?". It's a very restrained performance, and no, it isn't a transformation. Some will once again say that Clooney is only "playing himself", but to me, when Clooney does great, he really nails it. He gives all of his performances something distinct about them, and this is perhaps his wild-card character. He doesn't add in his usual smoothness that we see a lot from him. This stands apart, and I am surprised for that reason for its success. Shailene Woodley is fantastic here as well, and really impressed me with the sort of indignation and maturity that she mixes together. She's better than most of the contenders for the Oscar in her category, more specifically Octavia Spencer, Melissa McCarthy, and Janet McTeer.\n\nI loved this film. I wasn't sure of it while I was seeing it, but after it's over, as hard as it is to really describe and know why I enjoyed it so much, I did.

Każdy myśli, że został wybrany ze względu na swoje zdolności.

A Polish-directed/written film set in China with basically an entirely Chinese cast? A bit foreign for me (being from the US), to say the least.\n\nStarting out with the main character Wolski escaping from Russian Siberia into China, you watch as he is taken in by a poor Chinese family consisting of Guo, his wife, and their daughter Song. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, one night Song gets up from the dinner table and takes some food to Wolski. As soon as she sits down on his bed Guo comes in and knocks the food right out of her hand. From this moment on, Song is never the same, and you will see why.\n\nMy main complaint of this movie is that it is slow and lacks focus/direction in the early (after the first 9min) to middle parts. It is a bit slow but luckily it picks up in the last third.\n\nOne thing this movie does well is subtlety. Maybe this is a trait of foreign films in general? I am not sure because I haven't seen enough. My recommendation is if you're a fan of or interested in foreign films and enjoy short but sincere romances, then give this film a shot.\n\nOtherwise, it might not be for you. I think I got something out of it, and for an otherwise stoic personality like myself, it definitely touched me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-09-01","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954076/","name":"Michal Zebrowski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1546399/","name":"Li Min"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2066134/","name":"Sun Ji Feng"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080717/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093398/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A Polish-directed/written film set in China with basically an entirely Chinese cast? A bit foreign for me (being from the US), to say the least.\n\nStarting out with the main character Wolski escaping from Russian Siberia into China, you watch as he is taken in by a poor Chinese family consisting of Guo, his wife, and their daughter Song. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, one night Song gets up from the dinner table and takes some food to Wolski. As soon as she sits down on his bed Guo comes in and knocks the food right out of her hand. From this moment on, Song is never the same, and you will see why.\n\nMy main complaint of this movie is that it is slow and lacks focus/direction in the early (after the first 9min) to middle parts. It is a bit slow but luckily it picks up in the last third.\n\nOne thing this movie does well is subtlety. Maybe this is a trait of foreign films in general? I am not sure because I haven't seen enough. My recommendation is if you're a fan of or interested in foreign films and enjoy short but sincere romances, then give this film a shot.\n\nOtherwise, it might not be for you. I think I got something out of it, and for an otherwise stoic personality like myself, it definitely touched me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-09-01","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954076/","name":"Michal Zebrowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1546399/","name":"Li Min","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2066134/","name":"Sun Ji Feng"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080717/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093398/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sure it's not a thought-provoking piece of art, but it's art done with class, integrity and art; these films were made at a time when action films were..actually..action films.

The only exception to this is Rambo, where he was fighting against a brutal regime in Southeast Asia. It worked because the setting was raw in it's brutal intensity; plus Rambo is a timeless hero and much more plausible. John McClane is just a beefed-up Jack Bauer without the hero's legendary outbursts of anger when something goes wrong or impedes him from saving the day. Not once is there a chance for the viewer to root for McClane. He remains lifeless and stiff; the very opposite of his portrayal in the earlier films.\n\nIn an attempt to distance itself from its PG-13 predecessor, the film makers decided to make this film rated R. Yet it hardly saved the film from it's mediocre direction. I suspect this was due to the large backlash from audiences of Live Free or Die Hard, a film that was only a Die Hard film in name only, not a "true" Die Hard film, which is evident in the director's inability to handle the material.\n\nI tried to keep an open mind, after the execrable LFODH, but after this, I hope Bruce and co. just hang up the wife beater for the final time.

Even the kids are fine, with Ielapi as the titular protagonist, the naive, stubborn but well-meaning Pinocchio, Baldari Calabria as the quietly mischievous young fairy and Di Domenicantonio as toxic friend Lucignolo.\n\nSpecial mention to the excellent make-up and costumes.\n\n7,5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11019,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2019-12-19","keywords":"based on children's book,puppet,marionette,toymaker,role played by multiple actors","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3542466841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3ZGNmYjUtOTY2MS00NjAwLWE1NmQtODkyN2NmNTg5YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3ZGNmYjUtOTY2MS00NjAwLWE1NmQtODkyN2NmNTg5YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Shot in stunning Italian locations, Matteo Garrone's rich world of mystery and wonder stars Academy Award® winning actor Roberto Benigni as Geppetto, the old woodcarver whose puppet creation, Pinocchio, magically comes to life with dreams of becoming a real boy.

And normally I would be inclined to agree with you, but for some reason I still did like this film.\n\nIt contains fantastic acting including Hopkins, albeit certain scenes he may have overacted a tad bit, it's interesting and is enjoyable. In addition it also contains great references albeit not very subtle, the complete opposite of subtle to Psycho and a few other Hitchcock films which work to its advantage in my opinion. I also rather liked the inclusion of Ed Gein and the conversations that took place between him and Hitchcock.\n\nBasically this film will appeal to everyone. But, unfortunately it isn't the film it could have been or should have been, but ultimately it is enjoyable, funny and above all entertaining.

We've seen it before. Two stories, seemingly unrelated, yet parallel. Only this time it's based on a true story, and the 2017 book "All My Tomorrows" by Brian Gregory. Director Lance Hool and co-writers Veronica Hool and Robin U. Russin serve up a touching and inspirational story of how the lives of families can intersect, and how triumph can come from tragedy.\n\nAdmittedly, the film has a bit of Lifetime Movie Channel look and feel. It even begins with some conventional philosophy on life courtesy of our narrator: it's either a miracle or it's not, and life either happens to us or for us. These are neither particularly thought-provoking nor deep, however, they do set the stage well enough for the story. We first see an unconscious Chris Gregory (Jacob Elordi, THE KISSING BOOTH) being wheeled on a gurney into the surgical area of a hospital. His loved ones are obviously concerned.

We've seen it before. Two stories, seemingly unrelated, yet parallel. Only this time it's based on a true story, and the 2017 book "All My Tomorrows" by Brian Gregory. Director Lance Hool and co-writers Veronica Hool and Robin U. Russin serve up a touching and inspirational story of how the lives of families can intersect, and how triumph can come from tragedy.\n\nAdmittedly, the film has a bit of Lifetime Movie Channel look and feel. It even begins with some conventional philosophy on life courtesy of our narrator: it's either a miracle or it's not, and life either happens to us or for us. These are neither particularly thought-provoking nor deep, however, they do set the stage well enough for the story. We first see an unconscious Chris Gregory (Jacob Elordi, THE KISSING BOOTH) being wheeled on a gurney into the surgical area of a hospital. His loved ones are obviously concerned. We then cut to a period many years earlier as a young Cuban boy passes out on a soccer field. We learn Jorge Bolivar has a lung disease, and has been told at various stages that he wouldn't live past 12, 20, or 30 years old.\n\nDespite the different time periods, we see the symmetry with the romantic interests of the men.

But 'Capone' manages that rare feat: it's bleak - but not bleak enough to turn you off, and it's even often entertaining (in terms of its performances, the fantastic score, the beautiful cinematography). But even though this probably wasn't the film's intention, it still manages to be the ultimate deconstruction of the gangster as an "icon" - more so even than Scorsese's 'Irishman' (though it's nowhere near as good a film).\n\nI liked Capone; it's weird (and I guess you shouldn't watch it unless you like profoundly weird little arthouse films) but this is definitely not a badly made film.

It's almost very good, but it's let down by some muddled strands and a less than great ending.\n\nI really did enjoy the music, some enjoyable tracks throughout, giving it a bit of a vintage vibe. Some of the eighties VHS segments look a little bit naff.\n\nIt's boosted by some good acting, Tuppence Middleton is excellent, what a talented actress she is.\n\nNicely shot, atmospheric, I'd recommend it, 6/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-05-05","keywords":"female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Disappearance at Clifton Hill","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4284595993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGQ1YTRlMGYtOWQ0Yi00YWI4LWFmM2YtNDU2MjAzYjNjNTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGQ1YTRlMGYtOWQ0Yi00YWI4LWFmM2YtNDU2MjAzYjNjNTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10616645/","name":"Addison Tymec","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7348541/","name":"Mikayla Radan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2605843/","name":"Tim Beresford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2024774/","name":"Albert Shin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010810/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6475354/","name":"James Schultz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2024774/","name":"Albert Shin"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Melinda is a sweetly disturbed, well intentioned, lonely girl who forces awkward moments with customers and who dips her finger in freshly brewed coffee to feel the heat she wishes to have with a man. There's an off kilter emptiness to Melinda that Cobham-Hervey puts front and center with an appropriate misleading elegance, creating a complex and dangerous character in a standout performance. And Waterhouse steals every scene she's in as the wise cracking Sheila who instigates and pushes boundaries with the chip on her shoulder and eye rolling attitude. The 2 are the perfect foil for Josh Hutcherson's Billy, the would be robber who wandered into the wrong gas station. Hutcherson is effective here, perfectly charming and convincingly hot headed when his charm fails him. Burn is a fantastic little thriller that unfolds slowly to reveal a twisted series of events, and its 3 stars are integral to its success in a dialogue heavy script. I don't know if there's good and evil in the gas station where Melinda works, maybe just a thin line in between the 2 extremes and Burn manages to toe that line and explore the grayest areas of life, the purgatory people create for themselves...or find themselves in. It's here where Melinda lives, on the edges of this thin line between good and evil in the seedy gas station of the highway called Paradise Pumps. And if heaven is paradise, this long night at Paradise Pumps proves that paradise is indeed lost. Burn is a great little gem, I hope people check this one out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4112,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-23","keywords":"gas","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433924121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlkZDQzYTktZTk5YS00NDEzLWJjMGMtMTI3ODQ0M2Q3YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlkZDQzYTktZTk5YS00NDEzLWJjMGMtMTI3ODQ0M2Q3YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"A gas-station stickup doesn't go as planned for anyone involved in 'Burn.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5315479/","name":"Tilda Cobham-Hervey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4025229/","name":"Suki Waterhouse"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6120217/","name":"Mike Gan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303286/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177700/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577945/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6120217/","name":"Mike Gan"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He's completely unlikeable and the movie gets to the point where you're just sick of watching him being a total as.... You can't even blame it on his dementia, it's the character he plays, from the very begging, just nasty, evil person. Makes you wonder, how could those grown up kids of his still call him daddy. How much empathy do they have and where is it coming from? On one hand I admire them and on the other I cannot believe how they both turned out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4375,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-12-04","keywords":"father son relationship,coming out,actor director producer writer,lgbt,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1936900377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRiZGM4ZWEtNGNhZi00YTYyLWJmZTYtNjZhMmJjMTI3Y2ZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRiZGM4ZWEtNGNhZi00YTYyLWJmZTYtNjZhMmJjMTI3Y2ZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"John Peterson lives with his partner Eric and their adopted daughter in Southern California.

There's an off kilter emptiness to Melinda that Cobham-Hervey puts front and center with an appropriate misleading elegance, creating a complex and dangerous character in a standout performance. And Waterhouse steals every scene she's in as the wise cracking Sheila who instigates and pushes boundaries with the chip on her shoulder and eye rolling attitude. The 2 are the perfect foil for Josh Hutcherson's Billy, the would be robber who wandered into the wrong gas station. Hutcherson is effective here, perfectly charming and convincingly hot headed when his charm fails him. Burn is a fantastic little thriller that unfolds slowly to reveal a twisted series of events, and its 3 stars are integral to its success in a dialogue heavy script. I don't know if there's good and evil in the gas station where Melinda works, maybe just a thin line in between the 2 extremes and Burn manages to toe that line and explore the grayest areas of life, the purgatory people create for themselves...or find themselves in. It's here where Melinda lives, on the edges of this thin line between good and evil in the seedy gas station of the highway called Paradise Pumps. And if heaven is paradise, this long night at Paradise Pumps proves that paradise is indeed lost.

Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. \n\nQuoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together \n\nHis life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.\n\nHe's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.\n\nHe and his precocious, and "sensitive," daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.\n\nQuoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.\n\nHe also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne "Best Actress 2002" Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. \n\nMysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?\n\n The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us.

Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. \n\nQuoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together \n\nHis life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.\n\nHe's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.\n\nHe and his precocious, and "sensitive," daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.\n\nQuoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.\n\nHe also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne "Best Actress 2002" Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. \n\nMysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?\n\n The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us. Proulx creates her story's characters so rich in dimension with that same timeless appeal like a Huck Finn or Nicholas Nickleby, one expects to look them up in the local phone book when in town. But it's the subtle expert performances for subtle yet animated characters make this simply a masterpiece. The award shows are going to be quite redundant this year... A Beautiful Mind and its wonderful cast and performances will be The Shipping News' only competition in the BIG 3 categories - for sure. \n\n Spacey (whom I adore to the point of actually being speechless in front of), brings us, perhaps, his finest performance to date in Quoyle (pronounced coil).

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored, visually and audibly.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored, visually and audibly.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. \n\nQuoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together \n\nHis life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.\n\nHe's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.\n\nHe and his precocious, and "sensitive," daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.\n\nQuoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.\n\nHe also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne "Best Actress 2002" Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. \n\nMysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?\n\n The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us. Proulx creates her story's characters so rich in dimension with that same timeless appeal like a Huck Finn or Nicholas Nickleby, one expects to look them up in the local phone book when in town. But it's the subtle expert performances for subtle yet animated characters make this simply a masterpiece. The award shows are going to be quite redundant this year... A Beautiful Mind and its wonderful cast and performances will be The Shipping News' only competition in the BIG 3 categories - for sure. \n\n Spacey (whom I adore to the point of actually being speechless in front of), brings us, perhaps, his finest performance to date in Quoyle (pronounced coil). Kev reveals Quoyle's soul is wounded and yet his heart, even with all the injustices it has faced in its forty-something years that should be bitter and hard, manages to pound sweet, strong and hopeful. It's an unbelievable performance. Not that I'm surprised This man is a\n\nscrumptious treat for the senses not unlike like fresh fried Ipswich clams drizzled in tarter sauce with a side of old fashioned delectable helping of New England style cole slaw! \n\nWhy's Spacey so great? Is it because he hung with Jack Lemmon in his formative years as an actor? Or because (like myself) he adores the complicated gritty works of Eugene O'Neill? Perhaps, because he makes himself aloof to keep his personality out of his films, thusly making himself completely disappear into the film? Um yeah. Disagree? Get your own review. K-PAX aside, his work always brilliant, intense, or funny, or light it's what ever he wants it to be. I'd breed with the man, sure, but I'm also sure I will not be alone in my admiration for his performance here. Sorry, Russell, your also grand and one helluva actor, but your "butt" has been elegantly drop kicked by Cadet Fowler for the mad mad race for Oscar \n\nJudi Dench is, as always, an inspiration on film. \n\nJulianne Moore (Wavey) worked her plane Jane gorgeous self into a yarn of great depth and feeling. We wanted to make her tea and give her a hug by the end of the film.\n\nCate "I'm in every movie on the marquee this winter" Blanchett is a chameleon- somebody check her body temperature and dining habits! As Quale's rude, nasty, sluty bimbette squared love interest, Petal, she makes you loath her within the first forty-eight frames.\n\nPetal and Quoyle's offspring, little "Bunny", was played by triplets Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer. These gals could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his bubblegum money. They played beside veteran thespians like it was their birthright. You can picture the little dolls finished with their scenes sneaking off to be kids again "please pass the play dough, please, I'm done with my scene mum."\n\nPete "Kobayashi" Postlewaite plays Quoyle's nemesis at the paper with tons of humor and that smoothness of delivery he's so famous for. Love this man.\n\nWelsh and Sheppard's Pie of a manly man, actor Ryhs Ifans ( Little Nicky, Notting Hill) was adorable as Quoyle's new friend B. Beaufield Nutbeem. It was such a pleasure to see him- on so many different levels.\n\n Director, Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog, Cider House Rules) is famous for quirky studies on the human condition. Here he's strung his cast together like a Newfoundland fisherman's net and draws them so tightly together so as not a syllable of dialog slips away. In lesser hands The Shipping News could have been a sentimental sugar encrusted bakers dozen of stale over done leaden donuts.\n\nThere's so many more involved and each deserves accolades for bringing an already warm story to the screen with a remarkable toasty reality that makes you laugh, stir, and wonder  I feel bad for Ron Howard. He finally gets a nod or two and he has to be up against this film. \n\nSnack recommendation: Plain Donuts, fried octopus tentacle sandwiches and tea\n\nHeadline: The Shipping News looms over small cinema. Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim:" for once a film is better than its hype."\n\nBlunt Aside: Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance.

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems.

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard.

I've studied the Hitler period and was familiar with most of the events but the movie educated me while it thrilled and entertained me. It is a movie I was happy to take my teen-aged children to see because it also educated and entertained them. I thought the cast did a great job. The script was outstanding and the direction excellent. Tom Cruise gave a dimension to Von Stauffenberg that deepened my understanding of the events. The supporting cast were brilliant. \n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nPS. It's some time since I wrote this review and I took thirty minutes tonight to read the other reviews on this movie, not surprisingly they are mostly very positive and unanimous in praising it. Interestingly, the critics, including the one named above, who trashed the movie without even seeing it, obviously did so in an effort to kill it at the box office. While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'. Considering the historical background of Valkyrie I find that quite ironical.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":234683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-21","keywords":"nazi,conspiracy,nazi germany,nazis,year 1944","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3544383513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057712/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1267492/","name":"Nathan Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is a movie I was happy to take my teen-aged children to see because it also educated and entertained them. I thought the cast did a great job. The script was outstanding and the direction excellent. Tom Cruise gave a dimension to Von Stauffenberg that deepened my understanding of the events. The supporting cast were brilliant. \n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nPS. It's some time since I wrote this review and I took thirty minutes tonight to read the other reviews on this movie, not surprisingly they are mostly very positive and unanimous in praising it. Interestingly, the critics, including the one named above, who trashed the movie without even seeing it, obviously did so in an effort to kill it at the box office. While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'. Considering the historical background of Valkyrie I find that quite ironical.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":234683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-21","keywords":"nazi,conspiracy,nazi germany,nazis,year 1944","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3544383513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057712/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1267492/","name":"Nathan Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You can see why from the rugged dusty landscapes of Andalucia Benito Zambrano uses in 'Intemperie'. Rather clumsily titled 'Out in the Open' in English, doesn't really capture the essence of this chase western, 'Runaway' or 'On The Run' would be better.

It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood.

However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present.

THE WEATHER MAN was so poorly promoted when it hit the theaters that it seemed like it was going to be one of those asinine food throwing slapstick comedies instead of the very serious examination of contemporary life in the big cities, or even more about the struggle of a disillusioned man who cannot find a balance between business success and family/marital failure, it is. This viewer almost ignored it completely - until the DVD.\n\nDavid Spritz (Nicholas Cage) is a TV pawn the station uses as a weatherman: he is untrained as a meteorologist, skilled only be his TV persona success dependent on a created gag/tag line - the Nipper (the peak worst day in the forecast). His personal life is a mess, separated from a disconsolate wife Noreen (Hope Davis), distanced from his successful writer father Robert (Michael Caine) and on shaky territory with his two children - fat and sad Sully (Gemmenne de la Peña) and sweet but troubled pothead Mike (Nicholas Hoult). To make life worse his TV persona follows him into the streets of blustery Chicago where his viewers either seek autographs invading his privacy or throw food at him as the progenitor of the lousy cold weather. This polarized existence is invaded by an offer to become weatherman on Bryan Gumbel's Hello America show in New York (a career jump for which he longs for many reasons), serial confrontations with his father whom he emulates but always feels a failure, the finding that his father has lymphoma, the ridicule of fat Shelly at school, Mike's edgy involvement with his drug counselor Don (Gil Bellows), and Noreen's new live-in Russ (Michael Rispoli). How David meanders through this quagmire of dilemmas is the story and while it is not pretty, it is pungent.\n\nCage inhabits the strange role of David finding a way to make this loser with a short temper someone about whom we care. It is a tough assignment but Cage meets it on every level. Michael Caine provides some of the more eloquent moments in the film: his words of wisdom and view of life are the only grounded elements of the story. Likewise Hope Davis is fine as are the cameo roles of the children as sensitively played by de la Peña and Hoult. The subject of the film is tough and the excessive use of potty mouth language is overbearing and at times one wishes Verbinski would have edited some of the gross food slinging scenes.\n\nBut as an overall message movie there is much here to admire. It simply is not the mindless slapstick the posters and trailers would indicate. The PR folks on this one blew it. Worth your time and attention.

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present. The actors played their roles well and realistic, while I give credit to the director for packing so much real-life' into a small movie.\n\nI really did enjoy and digest this great story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":997,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980416025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After 15 years in prison, Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) reunites with his high school girlfriend, Dolores (Jena Malone), who is now a single mother of three.

A strong, uncompromising movie, gripping even if you know the ending before it starts.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"1979-06-22","keywords":"escape,prison,island,prison island,1960s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4045127193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089348/","name":"Roberts Blossom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796923/","name":"Don Siegel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102264/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115431/","name":"J.

Every character had to describe every other character as "the best of the best", "the best the agency ever had", "the best I've ever seen".\n\nIf you have to tell your audience someone is the best, then they are probably not. The writers are just getting in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewers to come to their own conclusions., Instead, we're being TOLD everything.\n\nAlso, Queen Latifah is a good actress. She is, however, remarkably miscast in this series. The writers aren't writing to her strengths-- rock solid persona and strong delivery. Instead, they're trying to portray her as a seasoned fighter and are putting her in scenes where she's shown being physically violent. Those scenes fall flat due to the excessive jump cuts needed to compensate for the actress' lack of natural physicality. The classic 80's series did this well-- writing for McCall as a seasoned veteran in his late 50's vs. a modern spec ops warrior. As such, the original McCall used intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon.\n\nThis series could be saved but it needs some heavy reworking. Right now it feels like "Equalizer in Name Only". Branding this as a remake of the original series is a disservice to all involved. Instead, create a brand new character for your very talented lead and stop trying to retread the past.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-02-07","keywords":"justice,fighter,woman warrior,action heroine,one woman army","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457796/","name":"Tory Kittles"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004965/","name":"Adam Goldberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110950/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448397/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. \n\nAs always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-26","keywords":"vigilante,prostitute,mysterious past,gangster,ex soldier","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1649060889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A former black ops commando who faked his death for a quiet life in Boston comes out of his retirement to rescue a young girl and finds himself face to face with Russian gangsters.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631269/","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0479739/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921013/","name":"Richard Wenk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805994/","name":"Michael Sloan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2030456/","name":"Richard Lindheim"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Every character had to describe every other character as "the best of the best", "the best the agency ever had", "the best I've ever seen".\n\nIf you have to tell your audience someone is the best, then they are probably not. The writers are just getting in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewers to come to their own conclusions., Instead, we're being TOLD everything.\n\nAlso, Queen Latifah is a good actress. She is, however, remarkably miscast in this series. The writers aren't writing to her strengths-- rock solid persona and strong delivery. Instead, they're trying to portray her as a seasoned fighter and are putting her in scenes where she's shown being physically violent. Those scenes fall flat due to the excessive jump cuts needed to compensate for the actress' lack of natural physicality. The classic 80's series did this well-- writing for McCall as a seasoned veteran in his late 50's vs. a modern spec ops warrior. As such, the original McCall used intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon.\n\nThis series could be saved but it needs some heavy reworking. Right now it feels like "Equalizer in Name Only". Branding this as a remake of the original series is a disservice to all involved. Instead, create a brand new character for your very talented lead and stop trying to retread the past.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-02-07","keywords":"justice,fighter,woman warrior,action heroine,one woman army","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457796/","name":"Tory Kittles","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004965/","name":"Adam Goldberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110950/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448397/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

Every character had to describe every other character as "the best of the best", "the best the agency ever had", "the best I've ever seen".\n\nIf you have to tell your audience someone is the best, then they are probably not. The writers are just getting in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewers to come to their own conclusions., Instead, we're being TOLD everything.\n\nAlso, Queen Latifah is a good actress. She is, however, remarkably miscast in this series. The writers aren't writing to her strengths-- rock solid persona and strong delivery. Instead, they're trying to portray her as a seasoned fighter and are putting her in scenes where she's shown being physically violent. Those scenes fall flat due to the excessive jump cuts needed to compensate for the actress' lack of natural physicality. The classic 80's series did this well-- writing for McCall as a seasoned veteran in his late 50's vs. a modern spec ops warrior. As such, the original McCall used intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon.\n\nThis series could be saved but it needs some heavy reworking. Right now it feels like "Equalizer in Name Only". Branding this as a remake of the original series is a disservice to all involved. Instead, create a brand new character for your very talented lead and stop trying to retread the past.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-02-07","keywords":"justice,fighter,woman warrior,action heroine,one woman army","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457796/","name":"Tory Kittles"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004965/","name":"Adam Goldberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110950/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448397/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. \n\nAs always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-26","keywords":"vigilante,prostitute,mysterious past,gangster,ex soldier","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1649060889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQyMTYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5MzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A former black ops commando who faked his death for a quiet life in Boston comes out of his retirement to rescue a young girl and finds himself face to face with Russian gangsters.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631269/","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0479739/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921013/","name":"Richard Wenk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805994/","name":"Michael Sloan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2030456/","name":"Richard Lindheim"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Every character had to describe every other character as "the best of the best", "the best the agency ever had", "the best I've ever seen".\n\nIf you have to tell your audience someone is the best, then they are probably not. The writers are just getting in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewers to come to their own conclusions., Instead, we're being TOLD everything.\n\nAlso, Queen Latifah is a good actress. She is, however, remarkably miscast in this series. The writers aren't writing to her strengths-- rock solid persona and strong delivery. Instead, they're trying to portray her as a seasoned fighter and are putting her in scenes where she's shown being physically violent. Those scenes fall flat due to the excessive jump cuts needed to compensate for the actress' lack of natural physicality. The classic 80's series did this well-- writing for McCall as a seasoned veteran in his late 50's vs. a modern spec ops warrior. As such, the original McCall used intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon.\n\nThis series could be saved but it needs some heavy reworking. Right now it feels like "Equalizer in Name Only". Branding this as a remake of the original series is a disservice to all involved. Instead, create a brand new character for your very talented lead and stop trying to retread the past.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-02-07","keywords":"justice,fighter,woman warrior,action heroine,one woman army","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457796/","name":"Tory Kittles","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004965/","name":"Adam Goldberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110950/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448397/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

Robert DeNiro is amazing in a supporting role that is a big stretch away from many of his other films, and he does a perfect job. I think he comes close to stealing the movie.

Patrick Wilson also does a great job , he is a good actor and its a good warm up role for people to know his face in his next role in "watchmen".\n\nThe rest of the cast do a good job in there supporting roles. This by far is not a movie that will win any Oscars but it is a movie that will entertain, i recommend it for a Saturday night in with drinks. A very entertaining thriller with great acting from its two leading actors. I hope my review was help full and if you get the chance to see this take it, because it will not disappoint.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50509,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-19","keywords":"interracial couple,neighbor,suburb,double standard,suburbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lakeview Terrace: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3043295257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Samuel L.

Patrick Wilson also does a great job , he is a good actor and its a good warm up role for people to know his face in his next role in "watchmen".\n\nThe rest of the cast do a good job in there supporting roles. This by far is not a movie that will win any Oscars but it is a movie that will entertain, i recommend it for a Saturday night in with drinks. A very entertaining thriller with great acting from its two leading actors. I hope my review was help full and if you get the chance to see this take it, because it will not disappoint.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50509,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-19","keywords":"interracial couple,neighbor,suburb,double standard,suburbia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lakeview Terrace: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3043295257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Samuel L.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.\n\nI hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matinée price."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191694,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"monster,nuclear explosion,explosion,strong female character,strong female lead","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810380569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Resident Evil: Apocalypse"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347149/","name":"Sienna Guillory"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531095/","name":"Eric Mabius"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936838/","name":"Alexander Witt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032081/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286424/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.\n\nI hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matinée price.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191694,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"monster,nuclear explosion,explosion,strong female character,strong female lead","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810380569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Resident Evil: Apocalypse","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347149/","name":"Sienna Guillory","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531095/","name":"Eric Mabius"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936838/","name":"Alexander Witt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

Rooster is hired by a very plucky 14 year old girl, Mattie Ross (debuting Hailee Steinfeld), who wants to avenge her father. Dad was murdered by the cowardly Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who made out for Indian territory and who may now be riding with an outlaw, Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper), and his gang. They are joined by a determined Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who wants to arrest Chaney for a crime committed in the Lone Star state.\n\nThis new version of the Charles Portis novel was scripted and directed by the great filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who treat the material respectfully, even reverently. The dialogue is antiquated, yet quite literate, and it truly comes to life when spoken by this well-chosen cast. The story is straightforward and without filler, the pacing very efficient. Serious at times (and funny at other times), the film never veers too far into melodrama. It hits the ground running, with an older Mattie (Elizabeth Marvel) narrating and giving us the back story of Mr. Ross' killing. Two frequent Coen brothers collaborators work some real magic: cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose widescreen compositions are wonderful, and composer Carter Burwell, whose music is breathtaking.\n\nBridges completely disappears inside the role of the surly, tough, hard drinking marshal, while Damon gives one of his better performances. Brolin and Pepper don't show up until around the 80 minute mark, but do extremely effective work. As soon as you meet Chaney, you know you loathe him; he's that much of a heel. The strong supporting cast includes Dakin Matthews, Paul Rae, Domhnall Gleeson, and Leon Russom; it's also great to see Jarlath Conroy from George Romeros' "Day of the Dead" as the undertaker. But young Steinfeld leaves the greatest impression, giving us a heroine who is capable, determined, and very mature for her age, a girl who can hold her own dealing with a character like Stonehill (Matthews).\n\n"True Grit" 2010 is sometimes violent (and strikingly so), but is basically just a good, solid example of impassioned storytelling that maintains viewer interest for the better part of two hours.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":322825,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"2011-02-23","keywords":"revisionist western,reference to new mexico,death by hanging,long drop hanging,spanking threat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1984862489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0692427/","name":"Charles Portis"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After the emotionally charged story, and particularly the climax, of "Casino Royale", the bar was set very high for the follow-up.\n\nDoes "Quantum of Solace" deliver? Well, honestly, the answer to that depends almost entirely on what you were expecting. If you were expecting a lengthy, down-to-earth, 'realistic' ('plausible' is probably a better description for "Casino Royale") character-based revenge flick, "Quantum of Solace" is not it. What "Quantum of Solace" does is weave the characterization into the plot and action to the point where we don't have room to breathe. The criticisms against the movie for lacking in character development are downright absurd- it's all there, the movie just doesn't stop and explicitly tell you what it's doing. If you're paying attention to what Bond's doing throughout the film surely you will understand why he is motivated to do those things. It's pretty careful and refined writing from Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with the addition of script polisher/editor Paul Haggis). \n\nWhat "Quantum of Solace" doesn't do is deliver a repeat of "Casino Royale". I'm actually quite amazed at the venomous reaction to the film by fans who seem to adore the more humorous, faster-moving Bond films. I mean, this isn't exactly right up their alley, but it's sure as hell not as drawn-out and slow-moving (although I didn't feel that was a bad thing in CR's case) as "Casino Royale", it surely doesn't spend most of its time on the dialogue and characterization, and it surely isn't as significantly divergent from the Bond formula as that film was. This is, ultimately, not unlike several Bond films we've seen before. There's snarling foreign villains with accents, a shadowy evil organization with political motivations, there's plenty, plenty of action. The "Bourne" comparisons are especially confounding. So, because Robert Ludlum once took from the Bond character and stories to write his "Bourne" novels, the Bond film series can't go back to Bond's roots in Fleming's great novels for inspiration? I'd say that "Quantum" has more in common with Bond films of the past than any of the Bourne films. If they're talking about the action scenes here, then while they lack the coherence of some of the greatest action scenes in Bond history, they are still much easier to follow than anything in Greengrass' "Bourne" films. Outside the first 15 minutes there's barely anything here that resembles a Bourne film at all, actually. The first two action scenes- the car chase and foot chase- are over-edited for sure, but the rest of the action scenes are grand, particularly the plane scene and climactic action scene at the hotel. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film are all good, director Marc Forster doesn't mess up (which, given the quality of many of his previous films, was perhaps the greatest danger this Bond installment faced) the David Arnold score is not one of the great Bond scores, and his (or the producers') refusal to use an orchestral version of the score much during the actual film is quite frustrating, but it's quite good and certainly not among the worst scores the series has had. Craig is an absolutely superb Bond, Olga Kurylenko is a find Bond girl and fairly well-developed but not at the expense of Bond or the story, while Gemma Arterton's limited screen time is an unnecessary diversion. Arterton's not the only flaw here, the design is a bit naff at times, and there's several things that could have been done better, especially during the first 15 minutes, but the movie works as a whole, and it's not nearly as humorless as some are suggesting; there's some genuinely funny stuff here, without descending into over-the-top camp.

After the emotionally charged story, and particularly the climax, of "Casino Royale", the bar was set very high for the follow-up.\n\nDoes "Quantum of Solace" deliver? Well, honestly, the answer to that depends almost entirely on what you were expecting. If you were expecting a lengthy, down-to-earth, 'realistic' ('plausible' is probably a better description for "Casino Royale") character-based revenge flick, "Quantum of Solace" is not it. What "Quantum of Solace" does is weave the characterization into the plot and action to the point where we don't have room to breathe. The criticisms against the movie for lacking in character development are downright absurd- it's all there, the movie just doesn't stop and explicitly tell you what it's doing. If you're paying attention to what Bond's doing throughout the film surely you will understand why he is motivated to do those things. It's pretty careful and refined writing from Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with the addition of script polisher/editor Paul Haggis). \n\nWhat "Quantum of Solace" doesn't do is deliver a repeat of "Casino Royale". I'm actually quite amazed at the venomous reaction to the film by fans who seem to adore the more humorous, faster-moving Bond films. I mean, this isn't exactly right up their alley, but it's sure as hell not as drawn-out and slow-moving (although I didn't feel that was a bad thing in CR's case) as "Casino Royale", it surely doesn't spend most of its time on the dialogue and characterization, and it surely isn't as significantly divergent from the Bond formula as that film was. This is, ultimately, not unlike several Bond films we've seen before. There's snarling foreign villains with accents, a shadowy evil organization with political motivations, there's plenty, plenty of action. The "Bourne" comparisons are especially confounding. So, because Robert Ludlum once took from the Bond character and stories to write his "Bourne" novels, the Bond film series can't go back to Bond's roots in Fleming's great novels for inspiration? I'd say that "Quantum" has more in common with Bond films of the past than any of the Bourne films. If they're talking about the action scenes here, then while they lack the coherence of some of the greatest action scenes in Bond history, they are still much easier to follow than anything in Greengrass' "Bourne" films. Outside the first 15 minutes there's barely anything here that resembles a Bourne film at all, actually. The first two action scenes- the car chase and foot chase- are over-edited for sure, but the rest of the action scenes are grand, particularly the plane scene and climactic action scene at the hotel. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film are all good, director Marc Forster doesn't mess up (which, given the quality of many of his previous films, was perhaps the greatest danger this Bond installment faced) the David Arnold score is not one of the great Bond scores, and his (or the producers') refusal to use an orchestral version of the score much during the actual film is quite frustrating, but it's quite good and certainly not among the worst scores the series has had. Craig is an absolutely superb Bond, Olga Kurylenko is a find Bond girl and fairly well-developed but not at the expense of Bond or the story, while Gemma Arterton's limited screen time is an unnecessary diversion. Arterton's not the only flaw here, the design is a bit naff at times, and there's several things that could have been done better, especially during the first 15 minutes, but the movie works as a whole, and it's not nearly as humorless as some are suggesting; there's some genuinely funny stuff here, without descending into over-the-top camp. Actually, "Quantum of Solace" sees a welcome return of a deadpan delivery to the one-liners which evokes Connery's best moments. No winking at the camera, no raised eyebrows, just the jokes. Felix grabbing a beer and looking nonchalant as the SWAT team tried and failed to capture Bond, Bond stealing the bike from under the informant ("I missed!"), Bond and M at the hotel... So many great moments. \n\n"Quantum of Solace" is perhaps not one of the great Bond films, and while I would not like to see "Quantum of Solace" become the template which the Bond series will follow in the future (it is only completely satisfying when taken in context as part of a larger storyline), it is still not just a good action thriller, but an often gloriously enjoyable Bond film, and a fine entry in the series. \n\n8/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":416107,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-05","keywords":"bond girl,attempted rape,official james bond series,official bond film,opera","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quantum of Solace: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1024524313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Quantum of Solace, directed by Marc Forster.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0023832/","name":"Mathieu Amalric"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286975/","name":"Marc Forster"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353673/","name":"Paul Haggis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

On the surface, it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film, casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take, opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichés, including rooftop billowing fog, high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness, and larger than life acrobatic feats ("always check the garbage days" moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall). Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons (including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages) could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted, enjoyable cinematic fun. \n\nBut Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody, which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer, Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing, settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crime/mystery thriller and poignant character study, as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability, and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground, Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity, utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. \n\nOf course, being the work of a first time director, one would expect the occasional fumble, and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax, meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless, an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism (clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources) which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional, adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley, managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift, whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest, either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. \n\nThe casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius, as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film, beautifully blending child-like emotional simplicity, tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true, as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor, warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker, yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichés with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop, and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally, Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner, infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour, and bringing welcome life to the film.\n\nIt would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist: slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times, yet cleverly self-aware, comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness, and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic, cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody, straight out superhero film or character study (or ultimately all three), Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success, and one easily worth a watch.\n\n-7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-13","keywords":"vigilante,superhero,gun running,organized crime,pimp","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Defendor: U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi554959897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around three characters: an everyday guy who comes to believe he's a superhero, his psychiatrist, and the teenager he befriends."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993507/","name":"Kat Dennings"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0644897/","name":"Sandra Oh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005584/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichés with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop, and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally, Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner, infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour, and bringing welcome life to the film.\n\nIt would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist: slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times, yet cleverly self-aware, comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness, and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic, cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody, straight out superhero film or character study (or ultimately all three), Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success, and one easily worth a watch.\n\n-7.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-13","keywords":"vigilante,superhero,gun running,organized crime,pimp","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Defendor: U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi554959897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around three characters: an everyday guy who comes to believe he's a superhero, his psychiatrist, and the teenager he befriends.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993507/","name":"Kat Dennings","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0644897/","name":"Sandra Oh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255931/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005584/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my "seeing as many 2018 films as possible" quest.\n\nThis is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

On the surface, it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film, casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take, opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichés, including rooftop billowing fog, high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness, and larger than life acrobatic feats ("always check the garbage days" moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall). Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons (including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages) could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted, enjoyable cinematic fun. \n\nBut Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody, which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer, Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing, settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crime/mystery thriller and poignant character study, as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability, and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground, Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity, utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. \n\nOf course, being the work of a first time director, one would expect the occasional fumble, and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax, meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless, an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism (clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources) which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional, adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley, managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift, whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest, either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. \n\nThe casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius, as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film, beautifully blending child-like emotional simplicity, tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true, as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor, warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker, yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichés with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop, and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally, Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner, infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour, and bringing welcome life to the film.\n\nIt would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist: slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times, yet cleverly self-aware, comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness, and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic, cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody, straight out superhero film or character study (or ultimately all three), Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success, and one easily worth a watch.\n\n-7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-13","keywords":"vigilante,superhero,gun running,organized crime,pimp","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Defendor: U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi554959897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDgxMjkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around three characters: an everyday guy who comes to believe he's a superhero, his psychiatrist, and the teenager he befriends."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993507/","name":"Kat Dennings"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0644897/","name":"Sandra Oh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005584/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I will say this: My daughter is currently attending university in the U.S. and I can tell you I fear for her safety every hour of every day. Not because this story is happening now...but because it is so close.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200987,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-04-26","keywords":"rape,dystopia,violence against women,slavery,torture","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088803/","name":"Yvonne Strahovski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071026/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108881/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588005/","name":"Bruce Miller"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2726412313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Freedom is just the beginning.

But those who are patient and willing to open their minds and hearts, even when it may challenge the viewers to rethink their own personal biases, will find within this entertaining, sweet, simple film a remarkable message about challenging societal norms and not letting anything stand in your way of your dreams.

Just see the film, and be open to its message, and I am sure if you allow it too, it will touch you as well.\n\nP.S. : The short in front of the feature is the funniest animated short film pixar has ever done, so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it to be, the short film will have everyone in stitches, as it did our entire theater.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What I loved about the first one was it's rawness, it's artiness, it's intellect. No one, besides Bette maybe, was established and you're watching this group of gay friends find their way in life with all the drama in tow. Some storylines were risqué for the time, which made it all the more interesting. Cut to now and all of our beloved characters are well established, living these high flying lives that just seems so untrue to the characters that they were and it takes away a certain quality and relatability from them. We're now expected to find this in these new characters but the writing just doesn't quite live up to that same quirky standard. I understand this is a different show and perhaps they had to sell it that way to bring it back, perhaps they felt they needed a younger generation for a younger audience to relate to. It's not a bad show and the new characters aren't terrible, but there's a certain depth missing here.

My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E.

The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic.

Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind.

A good one and half hour laughter, certainly for adults only, but still this movie is better than few of the last comedy flicks i have seen.\n\nThe movie is filled with those moments which seriously tickles your funny bone.I felt very light hearted after the movie and i know most of the audience with me the theater too. The movie isn't about teaching you something, no message but tries to provide entertainment where i think it hasn't disappointed me at least.\n\nAnd all of the above, its a Jessica alba movie how can i leave that.\n\nWatch movie with a open mind and try enjoy it , it won't be tough to do that.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-09-21","keywords":"sex,breasts,true love,leg spreading,sex on stairs","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Luck Chuck Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2981167385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMzY2OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkzNjUy._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMzY2OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkzNjUy._V1_.jpg","description":"In order to keep the woman of his dreams from falling for another guy, Charlie Logan has to break the curse that has made him wildly popular with single women: Sleep with Charlie once, and the next man you meet will be your true love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004695/","name":"Jessica Alba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0375068/","name":"Mark Helfrich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026937/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831457/","name":"Josh Stolberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2521593/","name":"Steve Glenn"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We're now expected to find this in these new characters but the writing just doesn't quite live up to that same quirky standard. I understand this is a different show and perhaps they had to sell it that way to bring it back, perhaps they felt they needed a younger generation for a younger audience to relate to. It's not a bad show and the new characters aren't terrible, but there's a certain depth missing here. There was more to the L Word than affairs, it was about power dynamics, whilst at the same time being goofy and at times off the wall. GQ seems lost in a soap opera style drama and that comedic aspect seems absent. Which for an audience still deprived of real representation in the mainstream, might not seem that bad, but for others expecting more than this, you'll likely be disappointed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4263,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-08","keywords":"lesbian","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000884/","name":"Jennifer Beals"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595485/","name":"Katherine Moennig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0354157/","name":"Leisha Hailey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271093/","name":"Michele Abbott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149669/","name":"Ilene Chaiken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271884/","name":"Kathy Greenberg"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3625959449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 2 is available to stream August 6, 2021 on SHOWTIME."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Caruso, and everyman leading star Shia LaBeouf. These guys took us by storm with the pleasant surprise Disturbia last year, and pretty much anything with the name Spielberg on it has to be at least entertaining, if not excellent. That's what Eagle Eye is.\n\nFirst off, I cannot stress this enough: don't take this movie seriously. Please don't get mad because the movie isn't realistic. I know it's unrealistic. You know it. Shia LaBeouf knows it. That doesn't stop Eagle Eye from being one of the most entertaining and effective thrillers of recent memory. Is it as smart or as gripping as other chase and mystery thrillers such as the Bourne series? Of course not. However, whenever Eagle Eye stretches our minds to the breaking limits with the insanity on screen, it manages to throw in a mind boggling action sequence or two right as we start to get mad.\n\nThe film, very well masked by trailers that really only show the beginning of the film and small pieces of the end, deals with cyber-terrorism and a secret military project dealing with destruction and national security. The US Secretary of Defense is portrayed (Michael Chiklis), it's incredibly unrealistic, has Shia LaBeouf, and has a prominent military character (Anthony Mackie). I can already here the Transformers comparisons flying in. The film also lacks in the originality department elsewhere, as elements of I, Robot and Live Free or Die Hard are also present and quite obvious.\n\nI cannot give enough accolades to whoever thought up this action - Eagle Eye boasts arguably the best action sequences of the year. The CGI is seamless and more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. With car chases to rival the best of them, as well as one of the most clever "on-foot" chases I've ever seen within an airport, Eagle Eye never fails to grab your attention with the incredible action sequences.\n\nNow to our cast, the headliners of which are two of film's biggest rising stars. Both live up to their names and reputations admirably. Shia LaBeouf revisits the "troubled youth" character he created in Disturbia, though his turn here is darker and has more depth. He really stretches some acting muscle in the beginning of the film, and it is because of this early success that we are willing to go along for the ride with him, following, trusting, and believing in his Jerry Shaw. Michelle Monaghan, long one of the most underrated in the business, also helps us believe in her character with a convincing show of emotion early in the film. The whole film, despite the action sequences, rides on the shoulders of the leads. If the audience doesn't like them, the film will ultimately fail. I'm pleased to tell you that they rise to the occasion and carry the film with ease.\n\nOur supporting cast includes veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. Maybe it was the script, but Thornton's character was so stereotypical and overdone that it almost made him laughable - especially towards the end. Chiklis did great in his role as the Secretary of Defense - and the unfortunate "victim" of circumstance. Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie are acceptable in even smaller roles.\n\nI remember when I watched my first D.J. Caruso film a few years ago (Two For the Money), and I remember how much I hated that film. However, Caruso has certainly grown as a filmmaker and has found his niche in the hugely entertaining action blockbuster genre, even if a lot of "movie borrowing" is done. This will be his breakthrough that will allow him a little more freedom as a filmmaker and possibly allow him to blossom into more than just an action film director. The touches of Spielberg are obvious, as the legendary director/producer's presence is only a plus.\n\nEagle Eye, in short, is a summer blockbuster released in September. It feels like a summer film, and has the components of a summer film: explosions, terrorism, and Shia LaBeouf. It is everything you want in an entertaining action thriller. Don't go looking for your super realistic epic here - Eagle Eye prides itself on blowing your mind every way possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-12-17","keywords":"audio surveillance,geopolitical,regime change,school bus,museum","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eagle Eye: Theatrical Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3270115609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Eagle Eye, directed by D.J.

Caruso, and everyman leading star Shia LaBeouf. These guys took us by storm with the pleasant surprise Disturbia last year, and pretty much anything with the name Spielberg on it has to be at least entertaining, if not excellent. That's what Eagle Eye is.\n\nFirst off, I cannot stress this enough: don't take this movie seriously. Please don't get mad because the movie isn't realistic. I know it's unrealistic. You know it. Shia LaBeouf knows it. That doesn't stop Eagle Eye from being one of the most entertaining and effective thrillers of recent memory. Is it as smart or as gripping as other chase and mystery thrillers such as the Bourne series? Of course not. However, whenever Eagle Eye stretches our minds to the breaking limits with the insanity on screen, it manages to throw in a mind boggling action sequence or two right as we start to get mad.\n\nThe film, very well masked by trailers that really only show the beginning of the film and small pieces of the end, deals with cyber-terrorism and a secret military project dealing with destruction and national security. The US Secretary of Defense is portrayed (Michael Chiklis), it's incredibly unrealistic, has Shia LaBeouf, and has a prominent military character (Anthony Mackie). I can already here the Transformers comparisons flying in. The film also lacks in the originality department elsewhere, as elements of I, Robot and Live Free or Die Hard are also present and quite obvious.\n\nI cannot give enough accolades to whoever thought up this action - Eagle Eye boasts arguably the best action sequences of the year. The CGI is seamless and more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. With car chases to rival the best of them, as well as one of the most clever "on-foot" chases I've ever seen within an airport, Eagle Eye never fails to grab your attention with the incredible action sequences.\n\nNow to our cast, the headliners of which are two of film's biggest rising stars. Both live up to their names and reputations admirably. Shia LaBeouf revisits the "troubled youth" character he created in Disturbia, though his turn here is darker and has more depth. He really stretches some acting muscle in the beginning of the film, and it is because of this early success that we are willing to go along for the ride with him, following, trusting, and believing in his Jerry Shaw. Michelle Monaghan, long one of the most underrated in the business, also helps us believe in her character with a convincing show of emotion early in the film. The whole film, despite the action sequences, rides on the shoulders of the leads. If the audience doesn't like them, the film will ultimately fail. I'm pleased to tell you that they rise to the occasion and carry the film with ease.\n\nOur supporting cast includes veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. Maybe it was the script, but Thornton's character was so stereotypical and overdone that it almost made him laughable - especially towards the end. Chiklis did great in his role as the Secretary of Defense - and the unfortunate "victim" of circumstance. Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie are acceptable in even smaller roles.\n\nI remember when I watched my first D.J. Caruso film a few years ago (Two For the Money), and I remember how much I hated that film. However, Caruso has certainly grown as a filmmaker and has found his niche in the hugely entertaining action blockbuster genre, even if a lot of "movie borrowing" is done. This will be his breakthrough that will allow him a little more freedom as a filmmaker and possibly allow him to blossom into more than just an action film director. The touches of Spielberg are obvious, as the legendary director/producer's presence is only a plus.\n\nEagle Eye, in short, is a summer blockbuster released in September. It feels like a summer film, and has the components of a summer film: explosions, terrorism, and Shia LaBeouf. It is everything you want in an entertaining action thriller. Don't go looking for your super realistic epic here - Eagle Eye prides itself on blowing your mind every way possible.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-12-17","keywords":"audio surveillance,geopolitical,regime change,school bus,museum","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eagle Eye: Theatrical Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3270115609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njk3ODI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAyNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Eagle Eye, directed by D.J.

But when Murphy went on his comedy antics, it was a bit too juvenile for adults. \n\nI thought Eddie was great, as was Yara Shahidi as the young girl, in an absolutely lovely, natural performance, while Thomas Haden Church was amusing as the fake Indian. But what was with the imaginary friends?? Were they real? If not, how did the girl get all the right information about the businesses? If they were... well... the film didn't seem to relay that. Wasn't it all generally another morality tale about parent/child bonding? \n\nAnd what was with all the Beatles songs? \n\nCertainly a pretty entertaining picture, but who is it for?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14432,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-08-05","keywords":"movie flop,two word title,slimehouse,sleepover,competition","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Imagine That","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1263272729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDUxMzUxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk5NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDUxMzUxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk5NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A financial executive (Murphy) who can't stop his career downspiral is invited into his daughter's imaginary world, where solutions to his problems await.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002006/","name":"Thomas Haden Church","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2780578/","name":"Yara Shahidi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456732/","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004412/","name":"Ed Solomon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558533/","name":"Chris Matheson"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This movie isn't all about action, explosions and that sort of things. What is does have is a heart, it shows the bond between people and it explains why that bond takes place. Just not in a corny way, this is more of a mix between real-life personalities, suspension, and a big plot-twist at the end kind of like Hitchcock did back in the days. Just not that elaborate. Some comments on this movie say that it lacks originality, but what movie doesn't do that these days ? Almost everything has already been done over and over again.\n\nAs concerns the quality of acting, it's just good. Nothing more but certainly nothing less. It's nice to see Anne Hathaway play a different sort of role, besides comedy. Her co-star Patrick Wilson also performs on a high wire. Andre Braugher and David Morse are good at supporting roles and thats is simply what they did in this one. You can't say that the acting wasn't good, therefore I feel sorry that it hasn't been properly promoted because it would have had some potential to getting to be a popular movie.\n\nConclusion: Like I said in the beginning, it's good, just not a masterpiece. I suggest you watch it and go with the flow, you won't regret it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35886,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Mystery","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-09-26","keywords":"airplane crash,survivor,explosion,afterlife,doctor patient relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Passengers: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3525836825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Passengers, directed by Rodrigo GarcÃ­a."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001556/","name":"David Morse"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006554/","name":"Rodrigo García"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142446/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123049/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159892/","name":"Ronnie Christensen"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie isn't all about action, explosions and that sort of things. What is does have is a heart, it shows the bond between people and it explains why that bond takes place. Just not in a corny way, this is more of a mix between real-life personalities, suspension, and a big plot-twist at the end kind of like Hitchcock did back in the days. Just not that elaborate. Some comments on this movie say that it lacks originality, but what movie doesn't do that these days ? Almost everything has already been done over and over again.\n\nAs concerns the quality of acting, it's just good. Nothing more but certainly nothing less. It's nice to see Anne Hathaway play a different sort of role, besides comedy. Her co-star Patrick Wilson also performs on a high wire. Andre Braugher and David Morse are good at supporting roles and thats is simply what they did in this one. You can't say that the acting wasn't good, therefore I feel sorry that it hasn't been properly promoted because it would have had some potential to getting to be a popular movie.\n\nConclusion: Like I said in the beginning, it's good, just not a masterpiece. I suggest you watch it and go with the flow, you won't regret it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35886,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Mystery","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-09-26","keywords":"airplane crash,survivor,explosion,afterlife,doctor patient relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Passengers: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3525836825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Passengers, directed by Rodrigo GarcÃ­a.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001556/","name":"David Morse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006554/","name":"Rodrigo García"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142446/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123049/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159892/","name":"Ronnie Christensen"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.\n\nOne issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.\n\nIn general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).\n\nIt's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was "That's IT?!". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":455162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,reboot of series,scene during opening credits","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.\n\nOne issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.\n\nIn general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).\n\nIt's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was "That's IT?!". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":455162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,reboot of series,scene during opening credits","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first episode sets the stage for this 18 episode series. After the Russians capture a German spy by the name of Hans Kloss, they spend a great deal of time interrogating him about the smallest details of his life. The German spy is replaced with a Polish look-a-like named Janek (Stanislaw Mikulski), and his "escape" is staged to have several German witnesses that will confirm his identity as a German officer. Hans Kloss provides intelligence and assistance to other spies he is aligned with and, more significantly, creates an environment in which the Germans are all suspecting each other of being a traitor, thus crushing their morale.\n\nHans Kloss gets himself into countless sticky situations, which nearly take a miracle to untangle from. Each episode has mystery and keeps one guessing how it will turn out until the very end. Although there is no major carryover in the storyline between each episode, there are more than a number of small details that find their way into the next installments.\n\nThe entire story takes place from 1943 to 1945, and we see Germany at its height of power to its gradual fall. The part that I found especially interesting are the final days of the war, when the tables were turned and the days of the Germany's power where numbered. The fear they inspired in others is now something they had to deal with themselves. I also found it interesting that it showed some of the German officers were positioning themselves to look favorable with the Americans hoping to find a haven with them (which has been confirmed a number of times with declassified information but isn't widely known).\n\nMore than Life at Stake is a classic Polish television show that has remained popular since its creation in 1967-1968 (and probably will for many years in the future). The episodes are alternately directed by Andrzej Konic or Janusz Morgenstern. Hans Kloss is a cultural icon that is probably just as popular as Czterej pancerni i pies, which was also made in the late 1960s. Furthermore, even though Stawka wieksza niz zycie was made during the period of Soviet occupation of Poland, there is less pro-communist sentiment than Czterej pancerni i pies and even portrays the AK favorably. More than Life at Stake is an exceptional WWII serial, particularly for those who like the espionage side to the story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"1968-10-10","keywords":"nazi,spy,cult,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586725/","name":"Stanislaw Mikulski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439202/","name":"Emil Karewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668037/","name":"Bronislaw Pawlik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098526/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first episode sets the stage for this 18 episode series. After the Russians capture a German spy by the name of Hans Kloss, they spend a great deal of time interrogating him about the smallest details of his life. The German spy is replaced with a Polish look-a-like named Janek (Stanislaw Mikulski), and his "escape" is staged to have several German witnesses that will confirm his identity as a German officer. Hans Kloss provides intelligence and assistance to other spies he is aligned with and, more significantly, creates an environment in which the Germans are all suspecting each other of being a traitor, thus crushing their morale.\n\nHans Kloss gets himself into countless sticky situations, which nearly take a miracle to untangle from. Each episode has mystery and keeps one guessing how it will turn out until the very end. Although there is no major carryover in the storyline between each episode, there are more than a number of small details that find their way into the next installments.\n\nThe entire story takes place from 1943 to 1945, and we see Germany at its height of power to its gradual fall. The part that I found especially interesting are the final days of the war, when the tables were turned and the days of the Germany's power where numbered. The fear they inspired in others is now something they had to deal with themselves. I also found it interesting that it showed some of the German officers were positioning themselves to look favorable with the Americans hoping to find a haven with them (which has been confirmed a number of times with declassified information but isn't widely known).\n\nMore than Life at Stake is a classic Polish television show that has remained popular since its creation in 1967-1968 (and probably will for many years in the future). The episodes are alternately directed by Andrzej Konic or Janusz Morgenstern. Hans Kloss is a cultural icon that is probably just as popular as Czterej pancerni i pies, which was also made in the late 1960s. Furthermore, even though Stawka wieksza niz zycie was made during the period of Soviet occupation of Poland, there is less pro-communist sentiment than Czterej pancerni i pies and even portrays the AK favorably. More than Life at Stake is an exceptional WWII serial, particularly for those who like the espionage side to the story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Action","War"],"datePublished":"1968-10-10","keywords":"nazi,spy,cult,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586725/","name":"Stanislaw Mikulski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439202/","name":"Emil Karewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668037/","name":"Bronislaw Pawlik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098526/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
