The movie does go down a few gears through the middle of the film but then picks up pace and the final 30-40 minutes are fantastic.

I'm not sure why this film is so hidden, it never took off and never went mainstream. I know there was a delay in releasing it and it also underwent a title change from 'Wastelands' to 'The Rise'.

Fortunately, he was wise enough to try different paths, and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them, except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.\n\nIn Fincher's third film, The Game, that solitude is physically incarnated by Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy businessman who is so obsessed with his job he has forgotten everything about the simple joys of life. The only person who still stays in touch with him is his younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn), who is Nicholas' polar opposite in terms of attitude. One night, when they're out to celebrate the elder brother's birthday, Conrad mentions a "game" that changed his life and suggests Nicholas participate too, as it would be "fun". Though initially hesitant, the latter eventually gives in to curiosity and decides to give it a shot. Within a few hours, however, he will regret it: the "game" is actually some sort of conspiracy involving everyone in town. With his assets frozen, his apartment no longer a safe place and no one left to trust, Nicholas must figure out how to solve the problem before it's too late - for him or someone else...\n\nAs usual, Fincher makes sure the film works on a technical level, cleverly using camera angles, lighting (shades of red and brown being the dominant color) and editing to keep the suspense alive and the atmosphere conveniently murky. It is mainly this masterful handling of film-making tools that keeps the viewer from questioning the logic of the nonetheless brilliant screenplay, some of the twists giving the impression of a dystopic set-up rather than a plausible situation (and yet the script is supposedly based on a real event). Two other elements contribute to elevating The Game above the average mystery tale: a truly unpredictable, phenomenal ending, in pure Fincher tradition (well, at least until he made Panic Room), and the great work by the leading men, Douglas' paranoid desperation slyly erasing all hints of typecasting (after all, this is not the first time he has played someone who is being manipulated; in fact, one scene explicitly spoofs one of those previous movies) and Penn's smug anarchy anticipating director's masterpiece, Fight Club, and its central character, Tyler Durden (without a doubt Brad Pitt's best role to date).\n\nIn short, those looking for a "different" cinematic experience should give The Game a try: it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first, but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a re-evaluation (Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released) and stands the test of time as one of the most original, smartest films of the '90s.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":365624,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-09-12","keywords":"game,surprise ending,suicide,puzzlement,manipulation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Game: The Criterion Collection [Blu-Ray]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3301942297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkMTNkMWYtOWQ2OS00OTEzLWJkOGYtMGYzNDgyYjg1MWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkMTNkMWYtOWQ2OS00OTEzLWJkOGYtMGYzNDgyYjg1MWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Three Reasons Criterion Trailer for The Game"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000679/","name":"Deborah Kara Unger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000399/","name":"David Fincher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058765/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045460/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After a wealthy banker is given an opportunity to participate in a mysterious game, his life is turned upside down when he becomes unable to distinguish between the game and reality." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0119174/","name":"The Game","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVmMDNmYmEtNGQ2Mi00Y2ZhLThhZTYtYjE5YmQzMjZiZGMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"After a wealthy banker is given an opportunity to participate in a mysterious game, his life is turned upside down when he becomes unable to distinguish between the game and reality.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0119174/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"MaxBorg89","dateCreated":"2007-05-20","inLanguage":"English","name":"Tight, twisted and tense - one of the most interesting thrillers of the '90s","reviewBody":"Having conquered the critics (and the box-office) with Se7en, David Fincher could have "sold out" and kept delivering more of the same. Fortunately, he was wise enough to try different paths, and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them, except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.\n\nIn Fincher's third film, The Game, that solitude is physically incarnated by Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy businessman who is so obsessed with his job he has forgotten everything about the simple joys of life. The only person who still stays in touch with him is his younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn), who is Nicholas' polar opposite in terms of attitude. One night, when they're out to celebrate the elder brother's birthday, Conrad mentions a "game" that changed his life and suggests Nicholas participate too, as it would be "fun". Though initially hesitant, the latter eventually gives in to curiosity and decides to give it a shot. Within a few hours, however, he will regret it: the "game" is actually some sort of conspiracy involving everyone in town. With his assets frozen, his apartment no longer a safe place and no one left to trust, Nicholas must figure out how to solve the problem before it's too late - for him or someone else...\n\nAs usual, Fincher makes sure the film works on a technical level, cleverly using camera angles, lighting (shades of red and brown being the dominant color) and editing to keep the suspense alive and the atmosphere conveniently murky. It is mainly this masterful handling of film-making tools that keeps the viewer from questioning the logic of the nonetheless brilliant screenplay, some of the twists giving the impression of a dystopic set-up rather than a plausible situation (and yet the script is supposedly based on a real event). Two other elements contribute to elevating The Game above the average mystery tale: a truly unpredictable, phenomenal ending, in pure Fincher tradition (well, at least until he made Panic Room), and the great work by the leading men, Douglas' paranoid desperation slyly erasing all hints of typecasting (after all, this is not the first time he has played someone who is being manipulated; in fact, one scene explicitly spoofs one of those previous movies) and Penn's smug anarchy anticipating director's masterpiece, Fight Club, and its central character, Tyler Durden (without a doubt Brad Pitt's best role to date).\n\nIn short, those looking for a "different" cinematic experience should give The Game a try: it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first, but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a re-evaluation (Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released) and stands the test of time as one of the most original, smartest films of the '90s.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":365624,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-09-12","keywords":"game,surprise ending,suicide,puzzlement,manipulation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Game: The Criterion Collection [Blu-Ray]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3301942297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkMTNkMWYtOWQ2OS00OTEzLWJkOGYtMGYzNDgyYjg1MWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkMTNkMWYtOWQ2OS00OTEzLWJkOGYtMGYzNDgyYjg1MWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Three Reasons Criterion Trailer for The Game","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000679/","name":"Deborah Kara Unger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000399/","name":"David Fincher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058765/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045460/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he said he was manipulated from the off with deep anxiety and anticipation. It recently came out to rent on DVD and I must have watched it about six or seven times now and loved every viewing and there are very few films that I can say that about. It is superb, if you have not seen it, don't read on, just go and watch it. It is obviously not technically the best film of all time, but I don't care what anyone says, it has become my second favourite film ever made, its that good. My reasons for loving it are probably very personal, so excuse my if you think I'm overrating it. I showed it to my mates though and they all loved it.\n\nSPOILERS AHOY Its a dark, yes very dark film, but Meadows has a knack of using humour to ensure his work is never miserable or too depressing. The scene where Sonny accidentally shoots his mate in the head with a sniper rifle is gloriously farcical. I even had to chuckle during the scene where Richard shows Herbie the mangled body of Tuff because of Paddys fantastic acting- 'D'ya wanna give 'im kiss?', 'D'ya want me t' shut it? yeah', unbelievable. The drug scenes are some of the most realistic I've ever scene; whoever suggests they aren't needs to go out and drop some trips and say that again.\n\nJust like all his films (except Once Upon A Time In The Midlands), the soundtrack is spot on. Perfect songs used with impeccable timing create a distinct, moody atmosphere. All the acting is fantastic (even the little kids at the end) the improvisation works a treat and you genuinely feel as if you know these characters, or have met them somewhere before.\n\nI feel sorry for anyone who didn't like this film, you really are missing out. There's a few small continuity mistakes, but I only noticed them after watching it a few times and you've got to be a miserable git to let that spoil the experience.

However, I finally managed to find a copy of it at a specialized video store in my city. (The version I found was the director's cut.) So what did I think of it? Well, I admit that the look of the movie is very convincing. The costumes, props, and set decoration look fantastic. It really seems that they captured what the colonies were like more than 200 years ago.\n\nHowever, the story and characters are less convincing. For example, the movie seems to suggest that most Americans were pro-revolution. In actual fact, a third were pro-revolution, another third were British loyalists, and the remaining third either didn't care or were undecided. Another odd fact is that the movie portrays just about all of the pro- revolutionists as despicable - odd because the filmmakers were trying to sell this movie to the American public! Actually, most of the other characters in the movie, like the British soldiers, are also shown in a negative light. There are precious few characters in the movie to care about. The actors try, but a lot of the roles are shallow.

However, I finally managed to find a copy of it at a specialized video store in my city. (The version I found was the director's cut.) So what did I think of it? Well, I admit that the look of the movie is very convincing. The costumes, props, and set decoration look fantastic. It really seems that they captured what the colonies were like more than 200 years ago.\n\nHowever, the story and characters are less convincing. For example, the movie seems to suggest that most Americans were pro-revolution. In actual fact, a third were pro-revolution, another third were British loyalists, and the remaining third either didn't care or were undecided. Another odd fact is that the movie portrays just about all of the pro- revolutionists as despicable - odd because the filmmakers were trying to sell this movie to the American public! Actually, most of the other characters in the movie, like the British soldiers, are also shown in a negative light. There are precious few characters in the movie to care about. The actors try, but a lot of the roles are shallow. Donald Sutherland and Nastassja Kinski have little to do despite their billing.\n\nThere are other problems in the movie I could go on for some time listing, like Pacino's extensive yet completely unnecessary narration.

Surprised that 'The Rise' was a very good film, exceeding my expectations in every way. A hidden gem almost, a film that I had not heard of until I saw it on Netflix. I am a fan of the genre; the British 'indie' scene is one that I usually enjoy. \n\nThis movie is marketed as a heist &amp; revenge movie, which is exactly what it is, but it is not your run of the mill heist flick. It is a powerful, gripping &amp; gritty drama with a great solid plot, good characters &amp; superb acting. \n\nIt starts very well, throwing you into the story, the lead character is being interviewed by a detective and he begins to tell the story, showing the viewer how he came to be in that situation. The movie does go down a few gears through the middle of the film but then picks up pace and the final 30-40 minutes are fantastic. I won't ruin anything, but the end of the film is very, very enjoyable. The acting is superb; you genuinely feel for the characters and certainly take sides between the good and bad. The 4 main lads are all convincing and portray their own characters well. There is definitely chemistry between the 4 leads and they do have a realistic, relatable relationship.\n\nOne negative I have is that I thought the relationship/girlfriend storyline was a little unnecessary but it is something we have come to expect in almost every film nowadays. To give credit though, it was kept to a minimum and acted more as a sub plot rather than taking centre stage throughout. \n\nI'm not going to say much more as I don't want to give anything away. I'm not sure why this film is so hidden, it never took off and never went mainstream. I know there was a delay in releasing it and it also underwent a title change from 'Wastelands' to 'The Rise'. Overall it is a very impressive film from a novice director/writer with good acting from all the young and upcoming British stars. \n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I am a fan of the genre; the British 'indie' scene is one that I usually enjoy. \n\nThis movie is marketed as a heist &amp; revenge movie, which is exactly what it is, but it is not your run of the mill heist flick. It is a powerful, gripping &amp; gritty drama with a great solid plot, good characters &amp; superb acting. \n\nIt starts very well, throwing you into the story, the lead character is being interviewed by a detective and he begins to tell the story, showing the viewer how he came to be in that situation. The movie does go down a few gears through the middle of the film but then picks up pace and the final 30-40 minutes are fantastic. I won't ruin anything, but the end of the film is very, very enjoyable. The acting is superb; you genuinely feel for the characters and certainly take sides between the good and bad. The 4 main lads are all convincing and portray their own characters well. There is definitely chemistry between the 4 leads and they do have a realistic, relatable relationship.\n\nOne negative I have is that I thought the relationship/girlfriend storyline was a little unnecessary but it is something we have come to expect in almost every film nowadays. To give credit though, it was kept to a minimum and acted more as a sub plot rather than taking centre stage throughout. \n\nI'm not going to say much more as I don't want to give anything away. I'm not sure why this film is so hidden, it never took off and never went mainstream. I know there was a delay in releasing it and it also underwent a title change from 'Wastelands' to 'The Rise'. Overall it is a very impressive film from a novice director/writer with good acting from all the young and upcoming British stars. \n\n8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His mission is to get close to a new mob boss, Bangun, by befriending his incarcerated son, Uco.

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First, San Antonio is a MAJORITY Mexican (yes, Mexican, not Hispanic and not a pejorative) city. It was part of Mexico BEFORE it was part of Texas or the USA. The city still embraces that heritage regardless of your particular race. There are few Mexicans on the staff whereas the hospitals in SA are representative of the local populace. There are more black people in this hospital than Mexican people which is insultingly wrong. I may be lily white, but where I shop, eat, and do anything, I am surrounded by not just 85%/15% white / black people.\n\nAfter their shift they talk about going out for pancakes and grits. That is totally the EXCEPTION for San Antonio. Elsewhere, this would not make sense, but in SA, its the Breakfast Taco. This is a normal tortilla filled with eggs / potatoes / chorizo / cheese / bacon or sausage. The countryside was settled by Germans and Poles in the early 1800's so you find incredible Polish Sausage and Kielbasa so even if they don't speak English, the restaurant has good sausage in the breakfast tacos. Only place in the country with this unique combination. You can't swing a dead cat in San Antonio without hitting a church or a restaurant that has breakfast tacos.\n\nThings they hit right are the military that come here and when they get out they stay here. Many of those military also have brown skin. It is good to see how the former military still maintain contact with current military but they always ask the white guys when they need military help and they seriously downplay the Asian doctor's service when it comes to phoning a friend for help. Only the white guys can reach out to other white guys in the military when they need military help?\n\nThe show also calls it wrong in hiring someone as a Physician's Assistant and treating them like a Physician's aide. A Physician's Assistant is an ACTUAL Title and has the same power as a Nurse Practitioner which have specific boards they have to pass, get their own patients, and write prescriptions. They're treated like doctors and given the same responsibilities except that a doctor simply has to review/sign off on their charts so they're NOT treated like assistants like in the show While actual specific privileges vary between states, they're treated like doctors almost universally.\n\nI feel slightly insulted they rely on a Mexican to translate to local immigrant families when in reality many of the staff who have skin of a different color (white or black, etc) would also be fluent. It's just part of the culture in SA while in California there's more of a stigma to it. If you're not Mexican and you speak some of the language, it's normal but in California it's often shunned. San Antonio embraces this which creates a more congenial atmosphere.\n\nReminding you that I have no Mexican heritage, hopefully you can see my point about the fact that the writers simply don't get the SA culture. They rely on cliché actors which unfortunately becomes rather bland quite quickly. Maybe they could reach out to Robert Rodriguez in Austin to grab some talent that would make an impact (no pun intended).\n\nIt would be great of the writers to interface the hospital staff with the Burn unit at Fort Sam which is widely considered the best burn center in the world.\n\nIn the show there are lots of pranks which are often funny and good spirited. In the real world, most of those would get someone in real trouble with the hospital policies since there is always that ONE person who complains and creates an actual incident out of a harmless prank as an HR issue. How I wish life could imitate art in this.\n\nEDITS: I am 13 episodes.\n\nAfter seeing it is filmed in Albuquerque, I must ask why they never thought to film in SA which would be MUCH less expensive and give them local shots. Shooting in Alb is completely out of touch. Might as well film it in Portland for how different it's from SA.\n\nIf there are 5 unique cities in the country including New Orleans &amp; SA, why not use the actual city because there's no substitute for unique.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews on blatant medical blunders, I would stress to the writers including a little more showing of washing hands, changing gloves, and medical sanitary procedures they would naturally follow while chatting which happens a lot more than chats up at the counters or store rooms. Doesn't waste film, just changes the set locations. Other than that, get over it since there is a review by a surgeon and everyone knows surgeons aren't mere humans. Yes, there is cinematic license, but use a medical adviser since half of the decisions shown where doctors ignore protocols would get them immediately suspended due to liability reasons and the malpractice insurance concerns. Sorry folks, doctors aren't rebellious when they pay 50K+ malpractice insurance but this is ignored for drama.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11363,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The city still embraces that heritage regardless of your particular race. There are few Mexicans on the staff whereas the hospitals in SA are representative of the local populace. There are more black people in this hospital than Mexican people which is insultingly wrong. I may be lily white, but where I shop, eat, and do anything, I am surrounded by not just 85%/15% white / black people.\n\nAfter their shift they talk about going out for pancakes and grits. That is totally the EXCEPTION for San Antonio. Elsewhere, this would not make sense, but in SA, its the Breakfast Taco. This is a normal tortilla filled with eggs / potatoes / chorizo / cheese / bacon or sausage. The countryside was settled by Germans and Poles in the early 1800's so you find incredible Polish Sausage and Kielbasa so even if they don't speak English, the restaurant has good sausage in the breakfast tacos. Only place in the country with this unique combination. You can't swing a dead cat in San Antonio without hitting a church or a restaurant that has breakfast tacos.\n\nThings they hit right are the military that come here and when they get out they stay here. Many of those military also have brown skin. It is good to see how the former military still maintain contact with current military but they always ask the white guys when they need military help and they seriously downplay the Asian doctor's service when it comes to phoning a friend for help. Only the white guys can reach out to other white guys in the military when they need military help?\n\nThe show also calls it wrong in hiring someone as a Physician's Assistant and treating them like a Physician's aide. A Physician's Assistant is an ACTUAL Title and has the same power as a Nurse Practitioner which have specific boards they have to pass, get their own patients, and write prescriptions. They're treated like doctors and given the same responsibilities except that a doctor simply has to review/sign off on their charts so they're NOT treated like assistants like in the show While actual specific privileges vary between states, they're treated like doctors almost universally.\n\nI feel slightly insulted they rely on a Mexican to translate to local immigrant families when in reality many of the staff who have skin of a different color (white or black, etc) would also be fluent. It's just part of the culture in SA while in California there's more of a stigma to it. If you're not Mexican and you speak some of the language, it's normal but in California it's often shunned. San Antonio embraces this which creates a more congenial atmosphere.\n\nReminding you that I have no Mexican heritage, hopefully you can see my point about the fact that the writers simply don't get the SA culture. They rely on cliché actors which unfortunately becomes rather bland quite quickly. Maybe they could reach out to Robert Rodriguez in Austin to grab some talent that would make an impact (no pun intended).\n\nIt would be great of the writers to interface the hospital staff with the Burn unit at Fort Sam which is widely considered the best burn center in the world.\n\nIn the show there are lots of pranks which are often funny and good spirited. In the real world, most of those would get someone in real trouble with the hospital policies since there is always that ONE person who complains and creates an actual incident out of a harmless prank as an HR issue. How I wish life could imitate art in this.\n\nEDITS: I am 13 episodes.\n\nAfter seeing it is filmed in Albuquerque, I must ask why they never thought to film in SA which would be MUCH less expensive and give them local shots. Shooting in Alb is completely out of touch. Might as well film it in Portland for how different it's from SA.\n\nIf there are 5 unique cities in the country including New Orleans &amp; SA, why not use the actual city because there's no substitute for unique.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews on blatant medical blunders, I would stress to the writers including a little more showing of washing hands, changing gloves, and medical sanitary procedures they would naturally follow while chatting which happens a lot more than chats up at the counters or store rooms. Doesn't waste film, just changes the set locations. Other than that, get over it since there is a review by a surgeon and everyone knows surgeons aren't mere humans. Yes, there is cinematic license, but use a medical adviser since half of the decisions shown where doctors ignore protocols would get them immediately suspended due to liability reasons and the malpractice insurance concerns. Sorry folks, doctors aren't rebellious when they pay 50K+ malpractice insurance but this is ignored for drama.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11363,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The real lynchpin of the whole endeavour is Ethan Hawke's battered Brown who oscillates wildly between devout believer and violent zealot never quite settling into anything categorizable but is a bewitching screen presence (despite portraits of Brown clearly pointing at Willem Defoe as the obvious choice - a casting bugbear that may bother me forever).\n\nThe cast are uniformly impressive, from personal favourites like Beau Knapp, Wyatt Russell and Steve Zahn to revelatory turns by a rather pompous Daveed Diggs and the arrestingly bemused Joshua Caleb Johnson who shines throughout.

While for the rest we have a standard french police series with the usual amount of crimes and personal life of the police unit members, what makes it unique it's her: goofy, bold, reasoning, she gets the job done her way. I don't think you can remain indifferent to the character: either you like her or not (personally I adore). She earned a place in the long list of eccentric people started, I believe, by Dr. House. The role is played by Odile Vuillemin. Update: season 7 sees the departure of Chloé, substituted by a new profiler, Adèle Delettre, a recurring character in the show. Her approach is very different from Saint-Laurent's and the series takes a more dramatic tone. A bit of sense of humour is missing so I'd give 7/10 to this new "profilage".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1128,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Zarówno Biała Gwiazda, jak i mistrzowie Polski mają w tym sezonie kłopoty ze skutecznością. Dodatkowo zespół z Krakowa, gdy pierwszy straci gola, zaczyna grać nerwowo, co negatywnie odbija się na wyniku meczu. Legioniści spróbują to wykorzystać. Są faworytami tego spotkania. Po raz ostatni przegrali z Wisłą w marcu 2019 roku, kiedy na stadionie przy ulicy Reymonta stracili aż cztery gole, nie strzelając żadnego.</desc>

    <title lang="pl">365 obiadów Mariety Mareckiej</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Gospodyni programu podpowiada, skąd czerpać inspiracje na codzienne obiady. Marieta Marecka zaprezentuje szereg pomysłowych i prostych w przygotowaniu posiłków. Podpowie też, jak odpowiedzialnie podchodzić do gotowania. W każdym odcinku prowadząca zaprezentuje trzy nowe, często zaskakujące potrawy, które złożą się w gotowy plan na obiad dla całej rodziny. Marieta udzieli również wskazówek na temat tego, co i za ile najlepiej kupić, jakie składniki możemy zamieniać na tańsze oraz jak robić zakupy w sposób przemyślany. Swój udział w tworzeniu programu po raz pierwszy otrzymają również widzowie, którzy poprzez przesyłane przez siebie zdjęcia, prezentować będą zawartość lodówki oraz pomysł na to, co można ugotować z takich składników.</desc>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!) Go see this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob.

So, if you wish to see a historically correct representation of year 1939 in Latvia in the eyes of an 8 years old girl from a poor and troubled family (although intelligent and loving in its own way) who later turns out to be one of the brightest stars in Latvian literature and a shortlisted Nobel candidate of several years - go ahead.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As a result, it is factually correct but loses some of the book's deeper qualities. Artistically well done, especially with the flawless major roles. Some of the minor characters didn't correspond well with the expected behavior of the generation. \n\nThe team consists of local superstars and this could be a bit too much for locals, but not a problem to foreigners. So, if you wish to see a historically correct representation of year 1939 in Latvia in the eyes of an 8 years old girl from a poor and troubled family (although intelligent and loving in its own way) who later turns out to be one of the brightest stars in Latvian literature and a shortlisted Nobel candidate of several years - go ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!) Go see this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!) Go see this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the West, he is known through his latest films (Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle), but in the East he's been a comedy phenomenon for years. He started his career in the early 90s as an actor, launched by several famous Hong Kong directors. It didn't take him long to start directing films himself, which brought him his current fame.\n\nA new Chow film is probably the most important public film event throughout the larger part of Asia. That said, the stakes were high for CJ7.\n\nChow is best known for his typical comedy formula: a mix of Hong-Kong humor, parody and crazy special effects that make his films stand out from the crowd. In that sense, CJ7 will be a surprise to many viewers. Talking about viewer expectations, Chow's new film could be compared to Danny Boyle's Millions. A film from a director that throws himself at the children's market without losing too much of its own identity, but with the chance of losing many of its initial fans.\n\nCJ7 contains enough typical Chow humor to make it recognizable, but at the same time CJ7 is targeted at a younger audience, with many themes lifted directly from other children's films. Take ET, add some Totoro, mix it with Chow's comedy and what you have is something close to CJ7. It's probably a good thing to realize this before going into the movie, as many will go in with the wrong idea and will be left disappointed by the film.\n\nIf you get used to the idea that this film is a bit different from Chow's other films, it turns out to be a pretty sweet, nifty and funny film after all. Most of the main roles are played by small kids, and they do a pretty great job. The main role is a bit too soft maybe, but the mini-triad kid is hilarious, the fat kids are plain weird (I wonder how they were filmed) and the little girl is really too cute.\n\nOf course there's also the alien, which is a cuddly little animal. It's digitally created but feels like a living, breathing, rubber bath toy. An awesome creation that plays a large part in the film's charm. To make it complete, Chow himself takes on the role of the father, which he does well (as usual). I think Chow's style of acting can easily put people off, as he seems pretty aware of the comedic scenes he's delivering (much like Takeshi Kitano), but his presence on screen is warm and compelling enough not to be bothered by it.\n\nThe film looks pretty lush and colorful, Chow really made some progress in the visual department. Although the special effect are still behind Hollywood standards, Chow keeps them functional and funny at all times, which makes the lacking technical qualities easy to forgive. The soundtrack could have been a bit less dramatic I think, although I guess those are the downsides of making a film mostly targeted at kids.\n\nCJ7 is still a funny film, though the number and range of gags is a lot smaller. They are replaced by a pretty typical but warm children's tale. The result is a film that could charm you as easily as it could disappoint you. Chow is enough of a director to pull it off, but those wanting another typical Chow comedy will be left with empty hands. Those willing to go along with Chow's fluff will be treated to a fun and cutesy film. 4.0*/5.0*","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14881,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He started his career in the early 90s as an actor, launched by several famous Hong Kong directors. It didn't take him long to start directing films himself, which brought him his current fame.\n\nA new Chow film is probably the most important public film event throughout the larger part of Asia. That said, the stakes were high for CJ7.\n\nChow is best known for his typical comedy formula: a mix of Hong-Kong humor, parody and crazy special effects that make his films stand out from the crowd. In that sense, CJ7 will be a surprise to many viewers. Talking about viewer expectations, Chow's new film could be compared to Danny Boyle's Millions. A film from a director that throws himself at the children's market without losing too much of its own identity, but with the chance of losing many of its initial fans.\n\nCJ7 contains enough typical Chow humor to make it recognizable, but at the same time CJ7 is targeted at a younger audience, with many themes lifted directly from other children's films. Take ET, add some Totoro, mix it with Chow's comedy and what you have is something close to CJ7. It's probably a good thing to realize this before going into the movie, as many will go in with the wrong idea and will be left disappointed by the film.\n\nIf you get used to the idea that this film is a bit different from Chow's other films, it turns out to be a pretty sweet, nifty and funny film after all. Most of the main roles are played by small kids, and they do a pretty great job. The main role is a bit too soft maybe, but the mini-triad kid is hilarious, the fat kids are plain weird (I wonder how they were filmed) and the little girl is really too cute.\n\nOf course there's also the alien, which is a cuddly little animal. It's digitally created but feels like a living, breathing, rubber bath toy. An awesome creation that plays a large part in the film's charm. To make it complete, Chow himself takes on the role of the father, which he does well (as usual). I think Chow's style of acting can easily put people off, as he seems pretty aware of the comedic scenes he's delivering (much like Takeshi Kitano), but his presence on screen is warm and compelling enough not to be bothered by it.\n\nThe film looks pretty lush and colorful, Chow really made some progress in the visual department. Although the special effect are still behind Hollywood standards, Chow keeps them functional and funny at all times, which makes the lacking technical qualities easy to forgive. The soundtrack could have been a bit less dramatic I think, although I guess those are the downsides of making a film mostly targeted at kids.\n\nCJ7 is still a funny film, though the number and range of gags is a lot smaller. They are replaced by a pretty typical but warm children's tale. The result is a film that could charm you as easily as it could disappoint you. Chow is enough of a director to pull it off, but those wanting another typical Chow comedy will be left with empty hands. Those willing to go along with Chow's fluff will be treated to a fun and cutesy film. 4.0*/5.0*","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14881,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the West, he is known through his latest films (Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle), but in the East he's been a comedy phenomenon for years. He started his career in the early 90s as an actor, launched by several famous Hong Kong directors. It didn't take him long to start directing films himself, which brought him his current fame.\n\nA new Chow film is probably the most important public film event throughout the larger part of Asia. That said, the stakes were high for CJ7.\n\nChow is best known for his typical comedy formula: a mix of Hong-Kong humor, parody and crazy special effects that make his films stand out from the crowd. In that sense, CJ7 will be a surprise to many viewers. Talking about viewer expectations, Chow's new film could be compared to Danny Boyle's Millions. A film from a director that throws himself at the children's market without losing too much of its own identity, but with the chance of losing many of its initial fans.\n\nCJ7 contains enough typical Chow humor to make it recognizable, but at the same time CJ7 is targeted at a younger audience, with many themes lifted directly from other children's films. Take ET, add some Totoro, mix it with Chow's comedy and what you have is something close to CJ7. It's probably a good thing to realize this before going into the movie, as many will go in with the wrong idea and will be left disappointed by the film.\n\nIf you get used to the idea that this film is a bit different from Chow's other films, it turns out to be a pretty sweet, nifty and funny film after all. Most of the main roles are played by small kids, and they do a pretty great job. The main role is a bit too soft maybe, but the mini-triad kid is hilarious, the fat kids are plain weird (I wonder how they were filmed) and the little girl is really too cute.\n\nOf course there's also the alien, which is a cuddly little animal.

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThe complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child. And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.\n\n Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any 'real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that 'one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.\n\nThe Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.\n\nHowever it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.\n\nBut if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I am so impressed by Ashley Judd, who I always liked, but had no idea of her range and courage. The film is very disturbing...I would describe it as a dark comedy that gets darker and darker and darker...calling it horror is too limited although there are horror elements to it. It reminds me of Cronenberg or early Polanski (Repulsion). But comparisons don't really do it justice. It's exciting to see that there are directors that still have guts. I was exhilarated and disturbed by the end of this film. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants something different and powerful.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Park jurajski</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Alan Grant od ośmiu lat zajmuje się badaniem życia dinozaurów. Ostatnio boryka się z kłopotami finansowymi. Coraz trudniej jest mu znaleźć środki na dalsze badania. Przystaje więc na propozycję Paula i Amandy Kirbych, którzy w zamian za zorganizowanie wyprawy na jedną z wysp dinozaurów, proponują bardzo wysokie wynagrodzenie. O prawdziwych intencjach pary Grant dowiaduje się zbyt późno, aby się wycofać. Okazuje się, że Paul i Amanda szukają swojego czternastoletniego syna i mają nadzieję, że chłopiec przebywa na wyspie, którą zamieszkują dinozaury. Podczas lotu dochodzi do katastrofy. Aby uniknąć zderzenia z dinozaurem, pilot kieruje maszynę w stronę lasu. Samolot rozbija się o wierzchołki drzew. Grant i jego towarzysze zostają uwięzieni na wyspie. Wkrótce przekonują się, że dinozaury doskonale się tu zadomowiły. Posiadły także umiejętność porozumiewania się na odległość. Okazuje się też, że tyrannosaurus rex nie jest już najniebezpieczniejszy. Ma teraz groźnego rywala, pteranodonsa, który równie swobodnie porusza się na ziemi, jak i w powietrzu. Grupa ludzi staje do walki o życie. Trzecia odsłona hitu.</desc>

I was exhilarated and disturbed by the end of this film. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants something different and powerful.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Others and I have been starving for more Nathan Fillion ever since Firefly. It seems he has finally landed a lead role, which he has so definitely earned, in an interesting looking series. At this juncture, I don't have many predictions for the series which is a rarity these days and I think that it will be fun watching Castle and detective Beckett's relationship grow. The writing was quite creative even though it sometimes felt like they were rushing things. I think its possible that they could have made this first episode last another week or two, however, at the same time, its fast pace leaves no time wasted. I found myself sprinting into the kitchen for munchies and racing back in hopes of not missing any of the action. I will definitely be watching this next week :)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":144703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

It's not about the endless romance between the doctors and nurses; it's not focused on the sexual perks and pains of the staff's sexual life, it is really focused about the medical aspect of the hospital. The characters are very refreshing and particularly Ryan Eggold is so endearing in his first remarkable role, I've actually never paid much attention to him before. I just hope it doesn't get cancelled prematurely, like it seems to be happening to all good shows lately that are not about superheroes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26097,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yet here he is, delivering an hilarious and heartfelt performance in what one would usually consider the most clichéd of genres: the romantic comedy.\n\nIn Ghost Town, Gervais plays Bertram Pincus, a socially awkward prick of a dentist who dies for seven minutes while going in for a routine colonoscopy. Through this miraculous experience he gains the annoying ability to see ghosts- all of whom want him to finish their business on Earth. In particular is Frank, the unfaithful husband of Gwen, a woman who lives in Bertram's building. Frank needs Bertram to separate Gwen from her new self-righteous do-gooder fiancé, and if Bertram can accomplish this Frank will make all the other ghosts go away.\n\nGreg Kinnear and the wonderful Tea Leoni round out the lead characters as Frank and Gwen. All three (Gervais, Kinnear, and Leoni) get big laughs and are utterly charming. Indeed, it is no overstatement to call Ghost Town riotously funny- the laughs come big and often. Too often it turns out, because when Ghost Town tries to stray into the more dramatic or tender areas of the story it feels somewhat awkward and forced. The mistake was made of focusing too much on broad hilarity, so that when the movie really attempts to focus on story it seems strange that the humor is suddenly gone. The film never becomes anything more than just a silly little trifle.\n\nYet there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. What we get is a thoroughly entertaining tale with a fascinating lead character. Add in the performances of the three leads and you have a fully satisfying movie-going experience. I would probably give this film a 7.5 rating, but since that isn't allowed and I'm not feeling an 8, I'll go with- 7/10 stars!!! \n\nJay Addison","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-09-19","keywords":"slipping and falling,dog walking,new york city,ghost,medical mask","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ghost Town: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3501196057","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bertram Pincus, is a man whose people skills leave much to be desired.

Frank needs Bertram to separate Gwen from her new self-righteous do-gooder fiancé, and if Bertram can accomplish this Frank will make all the other ghosts go away.\n\nGreg Kinnear and the wonderful Tea Leoni round out the lead characters as Frank and Gwen. All three (Gervais, Kinnear, and Leoni) get big laughs and are utterly charming. Indeed, it is no overstatement to call Ghost Town riotously funny- the laughs come big and often. Too often it turns out, because when Ghost Town tries to stray into the more dramatic or tender areas of the story it feels somewhat awkward and forced. The mistake was made of focusing too much on broad hilarity, so that when the movie really attempts to focus on story it seems strange that the humor is suddenly gone. The film never becomes anything more than just a silly little trifle.\n\nYet there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. What we get is a thoroughly entertaining tale with a fascinating lead character. Add in the performances of the three leads and you have a fully satisfying movie-going experience. I would probably give this film a 7.5 rating, but since that isn't allowed and I'm not feeling an 8, I'll go with- 7/10 stars!!! \n\nJay Addison","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-09-19","keywords":"slipping and falling,dog walking,new york city,ghost,medical mask","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ghost Town: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3501196057","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTU3NzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bertram Pincus, is a man whose people skills leave much to be desired.

Yet here he is, delivering an hilarious and heartfelt performance in what one would usually consider the most clichéd of genres: the romantic comedy.\n\nIn Ghost Town, Gervais plays Bertram Pincus, a socially awkward prick of a dentist who dies for seven minutes while going in for a routine colonoscopy. Through this miraculous experience he gains the annoying ability to see ghosts- all of whom want him to finish their business on Earth. In particular is Frank, the unfaithful husband of Gwen, a woman who lives in Bertram's building.

The film mimics the comic-book visuals, with an interesting use of colors and contrasts, spectacularly directed fight scenes, and the amount of "monsters", violence and gore that surpasses most of the slasher horrors I've seen. The criteria by which films receive R rating are quite puritanical and conservative, and in most cases, the reasons for this rating are ridiculous to me, but with the explicitness of violence and to some extent sex, "300" definitely deserves it. But although it has an epic atmosphere and is visually breathtaking, overall it is not particularly strong or impressive. I saw it about a decade ago, and now while watching it again I remembered almost nothing. The story and dialogues occasionally step in unconvincing and even a comic exaggeration, and I think it is too morbid for a story it tells. As a fan of horror and all kinds of twisted movies, it was somewhat suitable for me, but I don't recommend it to a faint-hearted audience and by no means for children.\n\n7,5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":747498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film mimics the comic-book visuals, with an interesting use of colors and contrasts, spectacularly directed fight scenes, and the amount of "monsters", violence and gore that surpasses most of the slasher horrors I've seen. The criteria by which films receive R rating are quite puritanical and conservative, and in most cases, the reasons for this rating are ridiculous to me, but with the explicitness of violence and to some extent sex, "300" definitely deserves it. But although it has an epic atmosphere and is visually breathtaking, overall it is not particularly strong or impressive. I saw it about a decade ago, and now while watching it again I remembered almost nothing. The story and dialogues occasionally step in unconvincing and even a comic exaggeration, and I think it is too morbid for a story it tells. As a fan of horror and all kinds of twisted movies, it was somewhat suitable for me, but I don't recommend it to a faint-hearted audience and by no means for children.\n\n7,5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":747498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't know why this wasn't just sold as some 1950s gangster series. The cast is amazing, great visuals and acting, but there is almost nothing supernatural about this! Which was kind of the entire point of Penny Dreadful. Aside from some dramatic walk-ons in a gorgeous leather gown from Dormer, and some odd side characters she somehow also needs to play, the supernatural aspect is completely missing. There is SO much that could have been done with the story. Disappointed because I was a huge fan of the original PD!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8473,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few. Adonis "Donny" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series. Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies. On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out. Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle. Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason. In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few. Adonis "Donny" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series. Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies. On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out. Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle. Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason. In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue. Whatever the future holds for the show the excellent Colin Morgan has a bright career ahead of him.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It doesn't even offend that a potential bad guy has a British accent.\n\nJust enjoy.

But I don't really want to rehash everything that everybody else has said, want I want to do is express my disappointment in a majority of the fans.\n\n Back Off!!!  A lot of the comments on this site have been nothing more than whining and nit-picking about what Enterprise "isn't."  The concept of this show has apparently flown past your heads at warp 4.5!  This isn't Trek as we know it!  That is the point, the traditional Trek was a tired dog that was on it's last leg.  The idea here is to do something new, something different that we weren't ready for.  Stop analyzing what it should be, what it could be, and what it has already done wrong.\n\n For those of you who haven't yet seen it, I'm telling you that it is fantastic; it's thrilling, touching, funny, adventurous, and as interesting and curious as the original series.  But, when you watch it, go in with ABSOLUTELY no preconceived notions of what Trek is or what it should be. Berman and Braga have done exactly what they have set out to do and that is to reinvent Trek.\n\n And for those of you who apparently had to bite your lip through this, where the heck is YOUR sense of adventure.  We are seeing the BEGINNING of Star Trek! This is a dream come true!  I mean come on guys,  we got to witness the FIRST time they ever see a Klingon!! How cool is that.  If you would stop trying, endlessly to find something to complain about, you would find yourself enjoying little things like finding out where Kirk's famous speech "Space, the final frontier..." actually came from, or seeing how afraid they are of the transporters.  How you can not be slightly giddy seeing  Jonathan Archer pick up a "Phase Pistol" and ask, "What's this?" These are the nuggets that you are letting slip by because you have this notion that you know what is best for Star Trek.  I have loved all the series'( though Voyager is by far my least favorite) but it was time for something new.\n\n One last beef with the fans, lay off the theme song.  I think its wonderful.  This is another one of those preconceived notions we have of what Trek is supposed to be.  Yes, it is different than what we are used to, but if you stop judging and actually watch the images being shown and actually LISTEN to the words, you may find it slightly inspiring. Not to mention the fact that it is actually a very pretty song, that is, when you haven't already canned it because of being close minded.\n\nThis series is not about the continuation of Star Trek, it is about the beginning of mankind's exploration into deep space; this is why it isn't called Star Trek: Enterprise, but instead it is just Enterprise.  This is not the utopian society of past Trek shows.  These people are flawed, curious, impulsive, and very far from perfect.  They make many mistakes and that is their enduring charm.

There are so many other things I loved, such as the grappler and the amazement of a pathetic warp 5, not to mention the fantastic cast and characters (Scott Bakula has always been a personal favorite of mine!,)but I just don't have room to go into detail.\n\n So on that note, stop shooting them down before they get going; I have a feeling its going to be one Hell of a ride!

But what impressed me, perhaps, most of all about "Bring It On" was the wonderful chemistry between the two beautiful-and talented-young female leads, Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91260,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance","Sport"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"legs,cheerleading squad,bikini,teenage romance,female nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244630/","name":"Eliza Dushku","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103038/","name":"Jesse Bradford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0715636/","name":"Peyton Reed"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335449/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070566/","name":"Jessica Bendinger"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="xx">Une femme française</title>
    <title lang="pl">Francuzka</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Une femme française: Directed by Régis Wargnier. With Emmanuelle Béart, Daniel Auteuil, Gabriel Barylli, Jean-Claude Brialy. Wed just as war breaks out, Jeanne hardly gets to know her military husband, Louis, before the debacle of 1940. While waiting for his return from a POW camp, Jeanne journeys through countless affairs with Louis' comrades- in-arms.
