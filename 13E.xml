    <title lang="pl">Mission: Impossible</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Agent jednostki Impossible Missions Force, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), postanawia zmienić swoje życie i wreszcie się ustatkować. W dniu zaręczyn z Julią (Michelle Monaghan) dostaje jednak wiadomość o zaginięciu funkcjonariuszki Lindsey Farris (Kerri Russell). W tajemnicy przed narzeczoną Ethan podejmuje się misji ratunkowej. Okazuje się, że Lindsey została porwana przez handlarza bronią OwenaDaviana (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Wydaje się, że operacja tajnego agenta ma szansę powodzenia. Rzeczywiście, Huntowi szybko udaje się znaleźć i odbić Farris. Wkrótce dochodzi jednak do tragedii. Przestępcy wszczepili bowiem w głowę kobiety ładunek wybuchowy. Uwolniona agentka ginie na skutek jego eksplozji. Hunt rusza do Watykanu, gdzie ma przejąć broń chemiczną, a także schwytać przebywającego tam Daviana, odpowiedzialnego za śmierć Lindsey. Udaje mu się aresztować gangstera, lecz jego sukces jest krótkotrwały. W drodze do Ameryki przebiegły handlarz zostaje uwolniony przez swoich ludzi. Wkrótce porywa Julię. W zamian za darowanie jej życia żąda, aby Hunt wykradł dla niego potężną broń. Atutem brawurowo zrealizowanego filmu są znakomite efekty specjalne.</desc>

As a result, it is factually correct but loses some of the book's deeper qualities. Artistically well done, especially with the flawless major roles. Some of the minor characters didn't correspond well with the expected behavior of the generation. \n\nThe team consists of local superstars and this could be a bit too much for locals, but not a problem to foreigners. So, if you wish to see a historically correct representation of year 1939 in Latvia in the eyes of an 8 years old girl from a poor and troubled family (although intelligent and loving in its own way) who later turns out to be one of the brightest stars in Latvian literature and a shortlisted Nobel candidate of several years - go ahead.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As a result, it is factually correct but loses some of the book's deeper qualities. Artistically well done, especially with the flawless major roles. Some of the minor characters didn't correspond well with the expected behavior of the generation. \n\nThe team consists of local superstars and this could be a bit too much for locals, but not a problem to foreigners. So, if you wish to see a historically correct representation of year 1939 in Latvia in the eyes of an 8 years old girl from a poor and troubled family (although intelligent and loving in its own way) who later turns out to be one of the brightest stars in Latvian literature and a shortlisted Nobel candidate of several years - go ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After the back to back tremendous successes of `Goldfinger' and `From Russia With Love,' every hack producer and distributor rushed to make spy movies.  There were serious ones (`The Spy That Came in From the Cold,' `The Ipcress File'), satirical ones (`Our Man Flint,' `The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' `Get Smart' ), and incredibly silly ones (`The Silencers,' `Last of the Secret Agents,' `Casino Royale').  `Casino Royale' was especially damaging, since it was (VERY LOOSELY) based on a Fleming novel, and used the character of James Bond, 007.  In fact, in `Casino Royale,' nearly EVERYBODY played `James Bond'.  `If we don't know what we are doing, how will the enemy,' was the explanation `James Bond' (David Niven) gave to explain why MI6 was calling all its agents `James Bond'.  To protect their franchise, the producers of the `real' James Bond movies emphasized in their promotion `Sean Connery IS James Bond.'   In a demonstration of  `gratitude,' Connery up and quit the series, leaving `On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' which was shortly to go into production, without a `Bond.'  \n\nArguably the most ambitious and difficult to shoot of ALL the Bond films (at least to that time), it's a miracle ANYTHING works in OHMSS. Much of the time it works VERY well, though the shaky underpinnings of the first hour frequently threaten to undo it.  There is so much choppy editing and dubbed dialogue, one begins to suspect he is watching a foreign film. The second hour plus works much better, all the more surprising since it was shot first. One reason may be that the film went WAY over both shooting schedule and budget, and there was enough made up `bad' press to put a great deal of pressure on the producers, first time director, Peter Hunt and star, George Lazenby.  In the middle of it all, Lazenby's publicist announced that Lazenby was not going to do another Bond (Lazenby is credible when he says that announcement was not his idea. One suspects, from the bonus material, that Cubby Broccoli planted that story to discredit Lazenby, should the film fail). Add to all this the films' tacked-on, unhappy ending (planned to be the prologue for `Diamonds are Forever'), which plays completely against the humor of earlier moments, and it's a wonder the film was NOT a dismal failure.  Quite the contrary, OHMSS is one of the BEST of the Bond films, filled with nonstop action, outstanding stunts, incredible sound, the best score (along with `Goldfinger') and a credible enough romance to lend it genuine poignancy.  Lazenby overcame many tremendous handicaps: having to replace one of the best known and popular actors in the world; he was 28, younger than  Connery when he made `Dr. No'; he was completely inexperienced as an actor  (OHMSS was Lazenby's FIRST movie, not just his first starring role); his accent (thick Australian outback) and the INCREDIBLE physical demands (Lazenby did many of his own stunts).  Considering all this, Lazenby is downright remarkable.  Certainly, in my opinion he is better than either the snooty Timothy Dalton or the lightweight Roger Moore were in ANY of their outings as Bond.. The bonus feature on the DVD concludes with strong evidence that Lazenby became a scapegoat, despite the eventual financial success of OHMSS. Lazenby, refreshingly displays no bitterness that his career nearly ended as soon as it began.  He's had a reasonably busy career playing character roles and we have OHMSS. Not a bad deal at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":83604,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Roger Moore's first outing as JB is, in equal measures, comical and action-packed. You'll never get bored. But it's definitely the weirdest Bond ever with loads of utterly bizarre moments.\n\nIt begins with M turning up at JB's house in the early hours while he's pumping some Italian agent for information (don't you just love his initialled dressing gown). Before sending him to America to investigate a Harlem pimp known as Mister Big he delivers some gadgets from Q-Branch, including a very useful watch. Q himself, or Major Boothroyd if you want to call him by his proper name, doesn't make any appearance in this one.\n\nStanding out like a Muslim in an airport, almost every single black person JB encounters in Harlem is on Mister Big's payroll. And they've got a seemingly endless bag of tricks to play on him. The funny thing about Moore is that he's very proper and British and doesn't think anything of walking into a tough Harlem bar while dressed up like the Duke of Edinburgh. His stunned reactions when they mess with his head are seriously funny.\n\nThe action then moves to Lousiana and a savage Caribbean island as JB uncovers a massive heroin plot. There's a particularly long speedboat chase across a bayou where JB encounters Sheriff J.W. Pepper, the most stereotypical southern redneck ever. Think of Texas Businessman from The Simpsons and you get the idea. JB also gets to dodge a hundred hungry Gators and do, many times over, Solitaire, Mister Big's Tarot card reader.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of formidable villain uses a Tarot card reader to help him do business but when you also surround yourself with a hook-handed maniac called Tee-Hee, a quiet fat guy called Whisper and a seemingly unkillable voodoo high priest called Baron Samedi then you really do become a serious baddie. Right? He even goes on a big speech about how his master plan works before attempting to kill JB slowly. Obviously this makes much more sense than just shooting him right away. When will they learn?\n\nDespite being the oldest actor to debut as Bond (at 46), Moore does look younger than Connery. And while Sean was gruff and Scottish, Moore is perpetually calm and refined, even in the face of danger (fingers being chopped-off, snake in the bath, being eaten by gators/sharks). Everything that the British once thought they were. He has a certain sarcastic edge that the other Bond actors lacked. While some of his films may have been the sillier of the franchise, Moore has always been my favorite. And the massive revolver and holster he uses at the end is so much more masculine than the usual, wimpy as hell, Walther PPK.\n\nAnd, as much as I am no fan of Paul McCartney, you gotta love that theme song! Exciting and iconic at the same time. And also yet another juxtaposition in the weirdest Bond movie ever. \n\nMI6, Harlem, Pimps, Paul McCartney, Gators, Heroin, Voodoo, Snakes, Sharks, Clairvoyance, Rednecks, Afros, Fake Afros, Fillet of Soul, Human Scarifice, Scarecrows and a small-headed man in a Top-Hat who lost a fight with chickens. Is this a Bond film or did the whole world just go insane?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's a particularly long speedboat chase across a bayou where JB encounters Sheriff J.W. Pepper, the most stereotypical southern redneck ever. Think of Texas Businessman from The Simpsons and you get the idea. JB also gets to dodge a hundred hungry Gators and do, many times over, Solitaire, Mister Big's Tarot card reader.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of formidable villain uses a Tarot card reader to help him do business but when you also surround yourself with a hook-handed maniac called Tee-Hee, a quiet fat guy called Whisper and a seemingly unkillable voodoo high priest called Baron Samedi then you really do become a serious baddie. Right? He even goes on a big speech about how his master plan works before attempting to kill JB slowly. Obviously this makes much more sense than just shooting him right away. When will they learn?\n\nDespite being the oldest actor to debut as Bond (at 46), Moore does look younger than Connery. And while Sean was gruff and Scottish, Moore is perpetually calm and refined, even in the face of danger (fingers being chopped-off, snake in the bath, being eaten by gators/sharks). Everything that the British once thought they were. He has a certain sarcastic edge that the other Bond actors lacked. While some of his films may have been the sillier of the franchise, Moore has always been my favorite. And the massive revolver and holster he uses at the end is so much more masculine than the usual, wimpy as hell, Walther PPK.\n\nAnd, as much as I am no fan of Paul McCartney, you gotta love that theme song! Exciting and iconic at the same time. And also yet another juxtaposition in the weirdest Bond movie ever. \n\nMI6, Harlem, Pimps, Paul McCartney, Gators, Heroin, Voodoo, Snakes, Sharks, Clairvoyance, Rednecks, Afros, Fake Afros, Fillet of Soul, Human Scarifice, Scarecrows and a small-headed man in a Top-Hat who lost a fight with chickens. Is this a Bond film or did the whole world just go insane?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Stuber is the common case of an awful marketing campaign that turned out to be a pretty solid summer buddy film, with two rising stars in Hollywood in Nanjiani &amp; Bautista. It borrows from many buddy-cop classics but their chemistry is enough to put some of the comedy that falls flat over the edge and bring some laugh out loud moments to the forefront. Granted, there were many big comedic scenes that were in the trailer, but that's inevitable in this day and age, and shows you even further how poor the marketing was for the film. It won't make enough money, but I could have definitely gone for more entries into this series with Bautista &amp; Nanjiani.\n\n6.9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Stuber is the common case of an awful marketing campaign that turned out to be a pretty solid summer buddy film, with two rising stars in Hollywood in Nanjiani &amp; Bautista. It borrows from many buddy-cop classics but their chemistry is enough to put some of the comedy that falls flat over the edge and bring some laugh out loud moments to the forefront. Granted, there were many big comedic scenes that were in the trailer, but that's inevitable in this day and age, and shows you even further how poor the marketing was for the film. It won't make enough money, but I could have definitely gone for more entries into this series with Bautista &amp; Nanjiani.\n\n6.9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished.

Definitely cried through a lot of the tough scenes. I had to remind myself it's "just" a movie, but it felt very real.\n\nAnyways, if you get a chance to watch this movie - I thoroughly recommend you should.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":559,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.\n\nHowever, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.\n\nOverall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.\n\nHowever, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.\n\nOverall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.

While there has been the occasional Emperor's New Groove or Lilo and Stitch, the majority of their films from this decade have been rather mediocre (most notably 2005's Chicken Little, which - ironically - remains the studio's highest-grossing film of the 2000s). With that said, I initially had some doubts about Bolt, despite hearing that it would be Disney Animation's first film supervised by Pixar founder John Lasseter. The surprisingly positive reviews posted shortly before the film's release convinced me to buy a ticket. Thankfully, I was forced to eat my words; welcome back, Disney.\n\nThe film revolves around Bolt, a white German Shephered who has spent his entire life on the set of a TV show in which he portrays a "superdog". As a result, he believes that the events on film (and his super powers) are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey to reunite with his owner and co-star, Penny. Along the way, Bolt teams up with a jaded alley cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino who also happens to be an extreme Bolt fanboy.\n\nFirst of all, the effects in this movie are unbelievable. Everything in the movie looks so realistic and yet doesn't contradict with the animated cartoon-esquire characters. Also, while Bolt is obviously the star of the movie, the real comedy comes from his unlikely companions. In fact, my favorite character of the bunch is Mittens the cat, voiced excellently by Susie Essman. Very seldom do I hear/see a character and say "I can't imagine anybody doing a better job playing him/her", but Essman really brings a lot to this already memorable character. And though I found him to be pretty irritating at first, some of the best lines in the movie come from Rhino the hamster.\n\nLastly, in one of the opening scenes we see Bolt as he is in the TV Show to set the understanding of Bolt's world. Seriously, that was made of awesome. The scene was action packed and full of excitement. I would watch the show that Bolt is in. If I had to have a complaint, it would be that it takes some ideas from several other films (such as Homeward Bound, Toy Story, and The Truman Show). That said, it still manages to feel like its own film, and with grace.\n\nWith terrific animation, an incredibly heartwarming story, and some of the most endearing characters I've ever seen on film (animated or otherwise), Bolt has not only become my favorite Disney film (Pixar included), but perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time. It feels strange saying that, especially considering that I didn't even expect to like the film, but I simply can't think of a movie that I've loved more. It's also one of the very few films that manages to bring me to tears every time that I watch it, and when a movie is able to affect me on that kind of level, it automatically becomes a winner.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":194882,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While there has been the occasional Emperor's New Groove or Lilo and Stitch, the majority of their films from this decade have been rather mediocre (most notably 2005's Chicken Little, which - ironically - remains the studio's highest-grossing film of the 2000s). With that said, I initially had some doubts about Bolt, despite hearing that it would be Disney Animation's first film supervised by Pixar founder John Lasseter. The surprisingly positive reviews posted shortly before the film's release convinced me to buy a ticket. Thankfully, I was forced to eat my words; welcome back, Disney.\n\nThe film revolves around Bolt, a white German Shephered who has spent his entire life on the set of a TV show in which he portrays a "superdog". As a result, he believes that the events on film (and his super powers) are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey to reunite with his owner and co-star, Penny. Along the way, Bolt teams up with a jaded alley cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino who also happens to be an extreme Bolt fanboy.\n\nFirst of all, the effects in this movie are unbelievable. Everything in the movie looks so realistic and yet doesn't contradict with the animated cartoon-esquire characters. Also, while Bolt is obviously the star of the movie, the real comedy comes from his unlikely companions. In fact, my favorite character of the bunch is Mittens the cat, voiced excellently by Susie Essman. Very seldom do I hear/see a character and say "I can't imagine anybody doing a better job playing him/her", but Essman really brings a lot to this already memorable character. And though I found him to be pretty irritating at first, some of the best lines in the movie come from Rhino the hamster.\n\nLastly, in one of the opening scenes we see Bolt as he is in the TV Show to set the understanding of Bolt's world. Seriously, that was made of awesome. The scene was action packed and full of excitement. I would watch the show that Bolt is in. If I had to have a complaint, it would be that it takes some ideas from several other films (such as Homeward Bound, Toy Story, and The Truman Show). That said, it still manages to feel like its own film, and with grace.\n\nWith terrific animation, an incredibly heartwarming story, and some of the most endearing characters I've ever seen on film (animated or otherwise), Bolt has not only become my favorite Disney film (Pixar included), but perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time. It feels strange saying that, especially considering that I didn't even expect to like the film, but I simply can't think of a movie that I've loved more. It's also one of the very few films that manages to bring me to tears every time that I watch it, and when a movie is able to affect me on that kind of level, it automatically becomes a winner.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":194882,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I feel the black &amp; white really enhanced this flick - it gave it an eerier effect than a colour film ever could. The B&amp;W gave the zombies an almost ghostly and most definitely a ghastly appearance. I think if this movie would have been in colour then it would not have the strong appeal and overall creepiness to it that the B&amp;W gave.\n\nThis is a wonderful late at night film that I would highly recommend to fans of the horror genre.

Almost all zombie films that came after this one were patterned after this movie. "Night of the Living Dead" is the most iconic zombie film ever made.\n\nThe movie is outstanding for it's genre and film type. I feel the black &amp; white really enhanced this flick - it gave it an eerier effect than a colour film ever could. The B&amp;W gave the zombies an almost ghostly and most definitely a ghastly appearance. I think if this movie would have been in colour then it would not have the strong appeal and overall creepiness to it that the B&amp;W gave.\n\nThis is a wonderful late at night film that I would highly recommend to fans of the horror genre. If you have not seen this film yet then you should find a copy to rent, buy or borrow because you will not be disappointed.\n\n8.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was charming, clever, and genuinely hilarious. It was a huge part of my childhood. My friends and I recite lines from the old episodes all the time, and we still laugh at them! Then, the movie came. Oh, don't get me wrong; the movie was pure gold! But since then, the great Stephen Hillenburg left the show and allowed it to rot away.\n\nNowadays, our favorite undersea sponge has been cut down, degraded, and utterly destroyed. That obnoxious, overly-emotional yellow square in the newer episodes? That is not Spongebob. It can't be. I really feel that kids should not be allowed to watch him anymore. It is a widely-known fact that kids imitate what they see; and believe me when I say that you DON'T want them imitating "Spongebob." He is far too emotionally disturbed. One minute he is unbearably and obnoxiously ecstatic for no reason, and the next he is screaming and crying like a particularly difficult baby. And he doesn't cry for a few seconds in a funny way, he cries for minutes on end like an unfortunate soul burning in hell; meaning that it is mentally painful to watch. Yeah, no one should let their kid mimic this kind of behavior. On top of all that, his voice has become incredibly high pitched and nerve-grating. Maybe Tom Kenny's overused the voice and now he's losing it. Whatever the reason is, it doesn't change the fact that it is incredibly annoying.\n\nAnd speaking of annoying, the show itself has simply lost it's touch with the humor. The old episodes were incredibly witty, and appealing to all ages. I still laugh at the jokes to this day. But then, one day I decided to watch a newer episode of Spongebob. I was horrified at what I saw; there was no actual humor, just attempts at humor that fell extremely flat. None of the jokes were funny! I found myself sitting there, trying to FORCE myself to laugh. But nothing at all was even a tiny bit amusing. The verbal jokes were incredibly lazy and dry, and many times felt forced. The physical humor was not any better. The writers for the show were running out of ideas--I could tell.\n\nI also have a few things to say about the animation. I don't know what happened, but I think the older episodes looked a lot better, and more rugged like other cartoons such as The Angry Beavers (great show, by the way). The newer episodes' animation features brighter colors, rounder, thicker characters, and obnoxious details that really should have been left out. Spongebob's face, for example, conveys far too much happiness and ecstasy, to the point were it gets a tad frightening. In fact, all the characters express far too intense emotions at times that are either very annoying, or borderline scary. In summation, if the look of a show is important to you, maybe you should stay away from the newer episodes of this far too long-running TV series.\n\nSomeone needs to take a stand against Nickelodeon, for subjecting us to watch this garbage that used to be gold. If this show had stopped after the movie was released, every individual who grew up with Spongebob would have been a lot happier. Please, only watch the old episodes. The new ones are so awful, it actually fills me with pain to think about them. Also, keep your kids away from the show. Spongebob has become a terrible emotional influence. Unless you want your kids to become horrible bipolar monsters, STAY AWAY FROM THE NEW EPISODES. Only let them watch seasons one through three. Nickelodeon needs to end the reformed Spongebob's reign of terror."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86511,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is a widely-known fact that kids imitate what they see; and believe me when I say that you DON'T want them imitating "Spongebob." He is far too emotionally disturbed. One minute he is unbearably and obnoxiously ecstatic for no reason, and the next he is screaming and crying like a particularly difficult baby. And he doesn't cry for a few seconds in a funny way, he cries for minutes on end like an unfortunate soul burning in hell; meaning that it is mentally painful to watch. Yeah, no one should let their kid mimic this kind of behavior. On top of all that, his voice has become incredibly high pitched and nerve-grating. Maybe Tom Kenny's overused the voice and now he's losing it. Whatever the reason is, it doesn't change the fact that it is incredibly annoying.\n\nAnd speaking of annoying, the show itself has simply lost it's touch with the humor. The old episodes were incredibly witty, and appealing to all ages. I still laugh at the jokes to this day. But then, one day I decided to watch a newer episode of Spongebob. I was horrified at what I saw; there was no actual humor, just attempts at humor that fell extremely flat. None of the jokes were funny! I found myself sitting there, trying to FORCE myself to laugh. But nothing at all was even a tiny bit amusing. The verbal jokes were incredibly lazy and dry, and many times felt forced. The physical humor was not any better. The writers for the show were running out of ideas--I could tell.\n\nI also have a few things to say about the animation. I don't know what happened, but I think the older episodes looked a lot better, and more rugged like other cartoons such as The Angry Beavers (great show, by the way). The newer episodes' animation features brighter colors, rounder, thicker characters, and obnoxious details that really should have been left out. Spongebob's face, for example, conveys far too much happiness and ecstasy, to the point were it gets a tad frightening. In fact, all the characters express far too intense emotions at times that are either very annoying, or borderline scary. In summation, if the look of a show is important to you, maybe you should stay away from the newer episodes of this far too long-running TV series.\n\nSomeone needs to take a stand against Nickelodeon, for subjecting us to watch this garbage that used to be gold. If this show had stopped after the movie was released, every individual who grew up with Spongebob would have been a lot happier. Please, only watch the old episodes. The new ones are so awful, it actually fills me with pain to think about them. Also, keep your kids away from the show. Spongebob has become a terrible emotional influence. Unless you want your kids to become horrible bipolar monsters, STAY AWAY FROM THE NEW EPISODES. Only let them watch seasons one through three. Nickelodeon needs to end the reformed Spongebob's reign of terror.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86511,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In this context, seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.\n\nParticular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts, the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision, studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory "shocker" ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly, director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline, but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes, a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh, as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably, but chiefly, my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loud-mouthed anti-hero category (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Snakes on a Plane), and on the other, his more nuanced (as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be) roles. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare.

Sean plays the comedic, smooth, and witty Bond to perfection while Daniel plays the mysterious, dark, and lonesome secret agent flawlessly. I will always choose a darker portrayal over a comedic one because it takes a certain mindset to depict someone of that nature. One of my favorite scenes is where Bond is sitting in a bar drinking alone. I don't care who you are or what your background is, if you are drinking by yourself in a bar, then you have issues that are haunting you. Whether you can admit it or not, you are in a dark place and that is exactly where this Daniel Craig portrayed Bond is. And I love it.\n\nAside from Daniel Craig, you have a cast that includes some of the finest actors that have ever graced the big screen. Javier Bardem plays a blood thirsty ex-MI6 agent out for revenge. His performance is equally as creepy and twisted as his portrayal of Anton Chigurh in "No Country for Old Men" and it is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney give important and memorable roles which I won't go further into detail about. Also two prominent figures from James bond history find their way back into the story line. Sam Mendes shows why he was the right choice to direct a film of this magnitude and along with the contribution of Oscar Nominee John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade come up with a memorable narrative after the disappointment of their last collaborating effort, Quantum of Solace. \n\nI look forward to what the future has in store for everyone's favorite spy.

I found the joke writing to be quite clever, especially at making fun of American cultural and political quirkiness. When was the last time I saw a relatable and funny Muslim family cast in a show? Never...until now. I think setting the show in London was a good choice, and most of the casting is excellent.\n\nI admit that there are two characters and/or actors playing them (I'm not sure which is the main problem for me) that I am not the most fond of, but overall I like the character development, unexpected twists, and fresh take on what it means to live in a culturally diverse big city in 2019.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Of course, we now know the Oslo Accords ultimately failed, but the process for which they came about remains truly inspirational.\n\nAlso, Ruth Wilson was wonderful and delivered a quietly powerful performance.\n\nTempted to give this film 10/10 to balance out the politically motivated ratings. But it's really an 8 for me.\n\nP.s. Teachers in university IR courses or high school social studies classes, this would be a great film to watch and discuss during units on international diplomacy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This movies is quite top in every aspect. It ranks for me equally to Dangerous Liaisons and My Beautiful Laundrette. The whole cast is superb including Sergi Lopez and Audrey Toutou. Chris Menges lensing is slick and appropriate. One of the years best.

In the scene when Juliet dances for Romeo - she is cut, the rule of thirds again failed, lots of people close/around her, and no Romeo. We can see him montaged in close-ups a couple of times... I want to see both actors in the same medium shot scene. The tension between them and do not care about other people's faces. They are secondary. But instead, Juliet looks standalone.

I can't share her pain with the kind and optimistic composition.\n\nIn general, I love the idea. I would not watch it again because of the camera and editing.

In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.\n\nAbout the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure "black comedy." It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.\n\nBoth William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three "are a trip." Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, "Marge Gunderson," elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband "Norm" (John Lynch).\n\nYou have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in "Carl Showalter" (Buscemi) and "Gaear Grimsrud" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances "Mike Yanagita" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.\n\nSo, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633292,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Juliets feelings are understandable event there is no single line. The character is fully uncovered and understandable. Unfortunately, all others do not bring the same feelings. I didn't get the temper, intentions, and philosophy of any other character. Random face mimics, characters appear and disappear, randomly their mood is changed without a clear reason why. Without lines, the only cinema language here would be - face mimics, body moves, and music. Neither faces nor bodies told me a story.\n\n2. Choreography. Impressed with Francesca again.

Camera &amp; Film editing. Dance scenes were often cut... I can see a dancer in a medium shot at the beginning and suddenly his legs are partially cut? Then I can see a close-up of the static face with no emotions while they dance? Lots of close-ups are just not justified and useless. While the dance is missed. Framing. In the scene when Juliet dances for Romeo - she is cut, the rule of thirds again failed, lots of people close/around her, and no Romeo. We can see him montaged in close-ups a couple of times... I want to see both actors in the same medium shot scene. The tension between them and do not care about other people's faces. They are secondary. But instead, Juliet looks standalone. In close-ups, faces are often... blurred. If that was on purpose - then I didn't get the point.\n\n4. Music. All fans would hate me here. But, in 2020 we might need more tragedy in really sad moments. For example - the finale scene. Romeo died and Juliet wakes up - light and delicate music (Yes, I am sorry for not knowing what is the title of this composition). Then she sees Romeo and her face screams - but the music is the same. The mood is changed - but the sound remains the same. I can't share her pain with the kind and optimistic composition.\n\nIn general, I love the idea. I would not watch it again because of the camera and editing.

In "Rocky II" (1979), after 15 brutal rounds, he defeats Creed and takes the title. In 1982, "Rocky III" sees our hero lose to Mt T before Apollo helps him bounce back. By the time of "Rocky IV" (1985), the franchise had acquired an international dimension as the Cold War is acted out in the ring with Rocky squaring up to the Russian Ivan Drago. Another five years passed before Stallone felt that he had to return to the iconic role - in "Rocky V", he adopts a young fighter who turns on him.\n\nThat really should have been it - but, as the tagline for "Rocky Balboa" puts it, "It ain't over till it's over" so, 16 year after the last film and an amazing 30 years after the original movie, he's back. It seems that Rock is so missing his wife Adrian that, in spite of running a successful restaurant named after her, he finds that he has something "luking in the basement". On this sixth outing, the narrative arc is just the same as first time round - again a complete no-chancer facing a world champion after a gruelling training routine involving the same frozen meat, the same one-armed press-ups, and of course the same race up the Museum of Art steps - and the same music.\n\nWhat's different is the advanced years of Rocky and of course Stallone himself - but he looks good, the film looks good, and you'll feel good at the final bell. As the man says: "It ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!"","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207014,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Cain's novel Mildred Pierce and were utterly baffled by the changed made to the 1945 film adaptation, have no fear: the 2011 remake is so faithful to the book, it's as if someone's reading it aloud. Spread out in a 5-part miniseries, every detail of the long-suffering mother's journey is shown, from the dissolution of her marriage to her baby steps of adapting to the business world, to the sadness each of her daughters bring, and to her second chance at love with a young playboy. Kate Winslet takes the helm, and after her predecessor won a long-awaited Oscar for the original, Kate took quite a risk.\n\nSince the two versions are so different, because of the story changes, Kate Winslet and Joan Crawford play two different women. Even if you love Joan Crawford, I think you'll still be able to appreciate Kate's interpretation and admit that she gives a heartfelt, exhausting performance. Kate modernizes the role, bringing her own brand of acting to Mildred's struggles, rather than trying to imitate Joan's stoic performance from the silver screen. She was rewarded, too, earning a Golden Globe for her work.\n\nWhile in the original, the characters of Mildred's husband, friend, and suitor are stereotypes and rather boring, in the remake, Brian O'Byrne, Melissa Leo, and James Le Gros each bring realism into their respective roles. Mare Winningham joins the cast as a fellow waitress, and she's so realistic it's as if she's been slinging hash her entire life. Evan Rachel Wood takes on the villainous role of Mildred's oldest daughter, and while I am partial to Ann Blyth's original breakthrough performance, there are no flaws in Evan's. She does everything she's supposed to do and makes the audience hate her just as much as they're supposed to. Guy Pearce plays the handsome, spoiled playboy, and while he's always excellent in every role he takes on, if you watch this miniseries you might be too distracted to focus on his acting talents.\n\nSince I've read the book, I thoroughly appreciated Todd Haynes' adaptation. This version is faithful from start to finish, and with several seasoned actors bringing the characters to life, it's very enjoyable to watch.\n\nKiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sex scenes and nudity, as well as upsetting scenes involving children, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As for the plot, it tries to be too mysterious and foreboding that it only confuses itself in numerous plot holes and bad character decisions for the sake of extending the story and providing unnecessary drama.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23011,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Runaways is decent at best with mundane script writing and an over saturation of clichéd characters. They've introduced so many characters early on that you're almost perplexed at times as to who's who and their relation to the other characters as well as their relevance to whatever the plot is becoming. As for the plot, it tries to be too mysterious and foreboding that it only confuses itself in numerous plot holes and bad character decisions for the sake of extending the story and providing unnecessary drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23011,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Usually, sequels are made to continue the story on the big screen. Creating this excellent series was a much better decision than producing lousy sequels for the masses. \n\nFans of the movie get to further explore all the ideas: The Stargate system, used by humans to travel the galaxy for thousands of years; Egyptian, Norse, and alien mythology; true science fiction - with fictional devices and concepts based on current science; and human exploration of our known universe  part of what made Star Trek so popular. \n\nYou see the characters develop over time, the quirky unexpected humor, the use of an alien who doesn't fully understand American English (like Data), the struggle of the oppressed, the lengths humans go in order to survive, politics and government bureaucracy, and the underlying tenet that there is more to human life then our brief appearance on planet Earth.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85393,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In 1994 (or 1996, if you follow the chronology of the series) the United States Air force has come into possession of the gate and recruits radical Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (then played by James Spader) to translate the runes found alongside it and activate the gate.\n\nSure enough, Jackson opens the gate and a reconnaissance team led by the stoic Colonel Jack O'Neil (a dour-faced Kurt Russell) is assigned to survey the world on the other side, later to be known as Abydos. Jackson too, is sent along with the goal of reopening the gate on the other side. Once on the other side though, the team come across a civilisation being ruled over by the mythical god Ra and come to discover the truth behind both the Abydonians and the Ancient Egyptians -  that thousands of years ago a dying alien parasite came to Earth and took a host in the form of a primitive human boy (Jaye Davidson). Using his advanced technology, the alien - now in human form - masqueraded as the god Ra, conquering the planet and using the Stargate to transport thousands of humans to Abydos to mine the minerals needed to sustain his technology.\n\nNeedless to say, O'Neil and Jackson see to it that the Abydonians are shown the truth about their god and rebel against him. Jackson stays behind on Abydos with his new wife Sha'uri (later changed to Share) and O'Neil's team returns to Earth.\n\nThe series picks up one year later, when the now dormant Stargate is reactivated unexpectedly and a hostile alien force seemingly under the leadership of Ra launches an attack on the base, taking a hostage in the process. In response, the base's new CO, General George Hammond (the superb Don S. Davis) calls on the now-retired Jack O'Neill (who, as well an extra 'L' in his name, has also become the much-lighter Richard Dean Anderson) to lead his team back to Abydos and determine the nature of this new threat. Back on Abydos however, Daniel Jackson (now played to perfection by Michael Shanks) shows O'Neill and scientist Captain (later Major) Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) that the Stargate can evidently open doorways to more planets than simply Abydos and that whoever attacked Earth did not originate from Abydos.\n\nThe situation becomes more critical though, when the same force attacks Abydos and both Share and her brother Ska'ra are taken. Jackson immediately returns to Earth, where the President authorises the creation of nine teams to uncover what lies through the Stargate on each different world - O'Neill's team (including Jackson and Carter) being designated SG-1.\n\nFollowing the Stargate address seen during the attack on Abydos, SG-1 travel to a planet known as Chulak where they discover the true origin of the enemy force - another alien masquerading as a god, this time as the god Apophis. The situation worsens when both Share and Ska'ra are revealed to have become hosts to the aliens, known as the Goa'uld. Imprisoned on Chulak, SG-1 must rely on Apophis' head guard when he turns traitor and agrees to help the team escape. The alien, Teal'c (the impeccable Christopher Judge), leads the team to the Stargate, all the while fighting a bloody battle in an attempt to recover Share and Ska'ra.\n\nAfter the rather breakneck pilot, season 1 of SG-1 falls into a rather repetitive pattern pretty quickly - the team shows up at a planet looking for advanced technology to fight the Goa'uld, stumbles across a problem with either the locals or said technology and spends the rest of the episode solving that problem. Although the episodes aren't really that lacklustre, they do serve to remind you that the Star Trek franchise has existed for years on pretty much the same recurring `planet of the week' plot. It's not until the season's final three episodes that the show shows even any sign of promise.\n\nThe season closing trilogy however, rejuvenate the series back to the strong form it displayed in the pilot, when Apophis finally launches his ships against Earth and SG-1 alone must prevent the planet's destruction. Although the story is concluded in the second season premiere, the main plotline picks up tremendously from there. By two-thirds of the way through it's sophomore season Apophis is gone and the scope of the show is revealed - there was never only two aliens to fight, there are in fight a large group - all masquerading as gods - known as the System Lords.\n\nThe show from then on deals largely with defending Earth against these enemies, although at the midway point in season three Apophis returns as the series' biggest foe and takes much of the play until the season four/five two-parter. It is in Apophis' aftermath that a new foe is revealed : Anubis. Once a powerful and sadistic Goa'uld System Lord, Anubis was banished when even the other Goa'ulds objected to his activates.\n\nMastering the technology of the Stargate builders (known as the Ancients), Anubis takes the tension to a whole new level when - by the close of season seven - he shows up in orbit of Earth with an armada waiting to destroy the planet.\n\nThe beauty of the series is simple : it never slumps unrecoverably. In every instance of a slightly dull episode, the following episode will undoubtedly show itself to be one of the best pieces of television you'll ever see. On a story-arc level alone, the series beats genre shows like Deep Space Nine and The X-Files hands-down almost simply because the arc stays consistent, there are no ludicrous changes of pace, no unexplained leaps that need to be taken and no confusion over the eventual direction of the story.\n\nThe evolution of the show is also a high point. By season six, technology recovered in the preceding seasons have been mastered and put into practical use. Characters show bonds that grow with time, even enemies become fleshed out and changed allegiances (for the first time I can remember on television) are actually plausible.\n\nThe two biggest selling points of SG-1 are it's writing and it's performances. In Anderson, the show has a leading man that fits every bill perfectly. The character - although admittedly a big leap from Russell's performance - grows incredibly to the point where every nuance is golden. In the confines of the Stargate universe, O'Neill has basically two roles - comedian and action hero, both of which are superbly portrayed. Shanks begins the series by essentially playing Spader playing Jackson and then evolving the character to the point that you forget Spader ever filled the role in the first place. Tapping - although irritating as hell in the initial episodes - eventually becomes intensely loveable, mainly serving as both the frustrated emotional core of the team and the brains of the outfit - coming up with a plan for every alien threat that comes their way. Judge is also spot-on, taking the kind of stoicism earmarked by Michael Dorn for all those years  and graduating it to a level of pure awe. Teal'c is a character that in the hands of an other actor could have been a disaster, but with Judge you actually find yourself revelling in the character's highs and lows as much as he himself does. Obviously the character fills the role of the team's muscle, but his level of comic relief is superb - not just on a level of writing, but also on a level of deadpan and delivery.\n\nThis show launches it's first real spin off in July (US) and September (UK) in Stargate : Atlantis, and with a proposed movie on the horizon the future is looking rosy. Above all, this is a franchise that deserves it's endurance and widespread appeal.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85782,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.\n\nSanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.\n\nFor Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site. For Americans it's on Hulu and Sci Fi's Rewind.\n\nHave fun getting into it, looking forward to see where it goes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19555,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now, this take on the story is a parody on the original story, with the same basic concept, but a more humorous storyline.\n\nI have never seen the original TV Series, but I doubt it would have made too much of a difference. "Land of the Lost" is without a doubt one of the worst films of the year 2009; especially considering that I actually thought the movie looked pretty decent in the trailer. I will never know how such an interesting and original concept was screwed up so badly and turned into an unfunny and pointless mess.\n\nDr. Rick Marshall is ridiculed on national television after he suggests the existence of time warps that could be used to solve the worsening energy crisis. Reduced to teaching science classes at elementary school, Marshall drops his theories, until Cambridge student Holly shows up at the school, and urges him to test his tachyon amplifier, a device that can create the necessary energy waves to open those gates. They drive far out into the desert, where the crazy redneck Will is running a cave entertainment park. While giving them a rafting tour through the cave, Rick and Holly get the tachyon amplifier to work and the three fall down a massive waterfall. When they wake up, they find themselves in the middle of a desert, right next to a Viking ship, proving Rick's theory of an alternate dimension, where the past, present, and future collide. Unfortunately though they lost the tachyon amplifier and now can't get back home to prove to the world Rick's been right all along. After the saving a primate from being sacrificed by his own people, the little monkey-like creature named Cha-ka reluctantly guides them through the strange "land of the lost, which is inhabited by green aliens, large dinosaurs, and filled with objects from the human world.\n\nSeveral words can be used to describe this film, among them being uninspired, dull, pointless and unfunny. The entire movie pretty much consists of the three main characters stumbling from one enormous mess into another, which for one reason or another doesn't turn out to be so dangerous after all. If you try really hard you might find the attempts of creating a plot once in a while, but all in all the entire thing is just all over place and never seems to find a point of focus. First the dinosaur appears, but when that "plot line" is finished after around ten minutes, the aliens are introduced about halfway through the film and they, of course, have the incredibly evil master plan of conquering the universe. The humor, which includes several sexual references, is childish and ridiculous, with many of the lines often not fitting with the scenes they are said in. And when the primitive monkey man Cha-ka has grabbed Holly's breasts for the fifth or sixth time, I just got really tired of it. To be fair, I laughed about half a dozen times in this film, once when Will Ferrell pours dinosaur urine all over himself in order to cover his human smell. It's really quite amazing how such a disaster was created with a $100 Million budget, and a director like Brad Silbering, who made "Casper" and "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events", both great and inspired movies. Most of the blame here can be put on the writers, Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas, who both don't have too much experience writing comic dialog, and most of the punch lines just completely fall flat. Those unfortunately occur at least two or three times a minute, and it's just painful to see that if the script had been completely rewritten dialog-wise the film could have been so much better.\n\nI'm really not the biggest fan of Will Ferrell, since most of his comedies tend to be hit and miss and often don't really work for me, and this film without a question belongs in the category "complete miss". Surprisingly though, I don't think Ferrell is really the one at fault, and if, once again, the script had been better, this could have been the perfect role for him. But here, he just stumbles around and has absolutely no chance against the horrendous words coming out of his mouth. The same goes for Danny McBride, who is the expert of sexual humor in this film, or at least he was probably supposed to be. While I thought he was amazing in "Tropic Thunder" last year, in here he pathetically fails at being funny. Anna Friel's role is not really a very comic one in the first place, and since she's incredibly serious among the two idiotic men accompanying her, there's not really that much bad stuff that can be said about her performance. Jorma Taccone though, as the primitive Cha-ka, is just plain awful, because even though he doesn't say too much, all of his attempts to be funny are somehow related to sexuality, and that's just not really my kind of humor.\n\n"Land of the Lost" was definitely the biggest disappointment of the summer, and I actually really enjoyed the trailer, which literally contains all the funny moments of the film. Will Ferrell certainly didn't do himself a favor by taking on this role, even though it would be unfair to bash him alone for the failure to deliver a solid movie here. While "Land of the Lost" is not the worst film of all time, which is mainly due to the fascinating sets, the absolute majority of it was catastrophic and it would have been better if the entire project would have landed in the land of the lost."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you try really hard you might find the attempts of creating a plot once in a while, but all in all the entire thing is just all over place and never seems to find a point of focus. First the dinosaur appears, but when that "plot line" is finished after around ten minutes, the aliens are introduced about halfway through the film and they, of course, have the incredibly evil master plan of conquering the universe. The humor, which includes several sexual references, is childish and ridiculous, with many of the lines often not fitting with the scenes they are said in. And when the primitive monkey man Cha-ka has grabbed Holly's breasts for the fifth or sixth time, I just got really tired of it. To be fair, I laughed about half a dozen times in this film, once when Will Ferrell pours dinosaur urine all over himself in order to cover his human smell. It's really quite amazing how such a disaster was created with a $100 Million budget, and a director like Brad Silbering, who made "Casper" and "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events", both great and inspired movies. Most of the blame here can be put on the writers, Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas, who both don't have too much experience writing comic dialog, and most of the punch lines just completely fall flat. Those unfortunately occur at least two or three times a minute, and it's just painful to see that if the script had been completely rewritten dialog-wise the film could have been so much better.\n\nI'm really not the biggest fan of Will Ferrell, since most of his comedies tend to be hit and miss and often don't really work for me, and this film without a question belongs in the category "complete miss". Surprisingly though, I don't think Ferrell is really the one at fault, and if, once again, the script had been better, this could have been the perfect role for him. But here, he just stumbles around and has absolutely no chance against the horrendous words coming out of his mouth. The same goes for Danny McBride, who is the expert of sexual humor in this film, or at least he was probably supposed to be. While I thought he was amazing in "Tropic Thunder" last year, in here he pathetically fails at being funny. Anna Friel's role is not really a very comic one in the first place, and since she's incredibly serious among the two idiotic men accompanying her, there's not really that much bad stuff that can be said about her performance. Jorma Taccone though, as the primitive Cha-ka, is just plain awful, because even though he doesn't say too much, all of his attempts to be funny are somehow related to sexuality, and that's just not really my kind of humor.\n\n"Land of the Lost" was definitely the biggest disappointment of the summer, and I actually really enjoyed the trailer, which literally contains all the funny moments of the film. Will Ferrell certainly didn't do himself a favor by taking on this role, even though it would be unfair to bash him alone for the failure to deliver a solid movie here. While "Land of the Lost" is not the worst film of all time, which is mainly due to the fascinating sets, the absolute majority of it was catastrophic and it would have been better if the entire project would have landed in the land of the lost.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Wyraźnie nie pasuje on do środowiska pracowników fizycznych. W trosce o własną pozycję, zamierza trzymać dyscyplinę twardą ręką. Nagły wypadek, którego ofiarą staje się jeden z ukraińskich robotników, wystawia zasady moralne Krzysztofa na próbę. Zdaje on sobie sprawę z tego, że łatwo być stanowczym tylko w sprzyjających okolicznościach. Jednak trudno mu przeciwstawić się złu, kiedy w grę wchodzą dramatyczne konsekwencje.</desc>

As an important labor organizer during the over the road trucker strikes in the 1930s, he accomplished many things that made possible the emergence of the Teamsters Union as a major political force for several decades afterward. At the same time, he fell into a trap that bedevils many a fighter who perceives her/himself as a "people's champion"- he convinced himself that he had to fight fire with fire, and in the end, it devoured him. Secondly, Hoffa did not have the money, the support or the political sophistication of a Robert Kennedy. This'll finish you in the United States. Despite all our bombast about law and order, the country loves its shady political characters charming and slick, or the medicine show man, witness: Clinton, Reagan, Bush. The awkward and openly coarse need not apply, witness Nixon, Hoffa, Lott. David Mamet understands that, and that's why his version of Hoffa's life works. \n\nMamet's Hoffa knows the Kennedy family built their fortune out of rum running to a large extent, and he sees no difference between their corruption and his own compromises. At least, Hoffa tells himself, his own deals with the devil serve something larger then his immediate family, they serve the membership of the union. And this was very true, which is why a fair number of Teamsters still swear by the name Jimmy Hoffa. Nicholson's snide asides to his "betters" completely captures the class war basis that motivated the actual man's actions. Anyone who has been through an actual labor dispute and has been witness to the patronizing communications that come through a company eager to crush a union effort knows full well what fired up Jimmy Hoffa, even as we turn aside from the path he took.\n\nThe film succeeds because De Vito, Nicholson and Mamet understand what pushed the labor movement forward, and they understand its contradictions. Most important, they understand why those contradictions overwhelmed a man as gifted as Jimmy Hoffa, and this is what makes it better then your average Hollywood drama about labor. Hoffa is a film about working class attitude that gets beneath the usual dismissals of working class concerns, and as such, deserves respect. The powers that be have every legend about their leadership. It's time the working class was allowed legends about its own once again, provided we understand that they are legends, and therefore laden with much myth. The very real larger then life qualities of Jimmy Hoffa, however, make this a film worth more then one critical glance."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21804,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Two! For someone like myself, that's reason enough to check it out.

He ends up heading home, and reunites with his brother. Staying at his bro's until he finds steady work all seems fine, that is until he begins realizing the outside world is still as unforgiving and selfish as it was before.\n\nNo Way Home was a good flick. It had a lowkey and unpredictable Tim Roth running the show with a decently solid supporting cast bringing up the rear. At first the movie tends to feel like it's trying too hard (overacting), but it hits a pretty serious groove and it begins becoming a very solid flick. Most probably due to the increase in sex, adult-themed conversations and gritty violence.\n\nWith some surprising developments, some nice attention to realism, and a couple kicks in the groin, this should be a nice viewing for anyone who enjoys serious drama. Tim Roth being the lead doesn't hurt the flick much either.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1411,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Two! For someone like myself, that's reason enough to check it out. But if you wanna know what it's about and blah blah blah, I suppose keep reading.\n\nAfter spending some time in the cooler Joey is now released and is looking to get his life back on track. He ends up heading home, and reunites with his brother. Staying at his bro's until he finds steady work all seems fine, that is until he begins realizing the outside world is still as unforgiving and selfish as it was before.\n\nNo Way Home was a good flick. It had a lowkey and unpredictable Tim Roth running the show with a decently solid supporting cast bringing up the rear. At first the movie tends to feel like it's trying too hard (overacting), but it hits a pretty serious groove and it begins becoming a very solid flick. Most probably due to the increase in sex, adult-themed conversations and gritty violence.\n\nWith some surprising developments, some nice attention to realism, and a couple kicks in the groin, this should be a nice viewing for anyone who enjoys serious drama. Tim Roth being the lead doesn't hurt the flick much either.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1411,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Renny Harlin used only a few minutes from the already existing footage, so "Beginning" really became a new movie. But unfortunately, the whole effort of re-shooting didn't make the movie better.\n\nIn Harlin's "remake", we get a smart young priest, straight from the Vatican (James D'Arcy) who has received all the information about the buried church in advance. In "Dominion", Gabriel Mann played an innocent priest who does not expect anything terrible, he just wants to start a school in the middle of Africa. The latter was the better screenplay idea in my opinion, because D'Arcy is such a cool "professional" that we don't really care about him, whereas Mann was a character the audience loves for his human feelings. Also there is more mystery in "Domionion" whereas "Beginning" once explained the whole background, and that was it - too easy.\n\n"Beginning" has a lot more gory effects, swarms of ugly insects and its demon uses obscenities in same way Linda Blair did in the original "Exorcist" movie. This will probably entertain people who just want a horror movie and nothing else. Mind you, "Beginning" also has good photography, a few unforgettable moments like the battlefield at the beginning and good actors! But the release of the original version "Dominion" proved that the story has had more potential, Schrader worked more careful with the characters and their relationships and gave more food for thought. I voted 6/10 for "Beginning" and 8/10 for "Dominion"."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Renny Harlin used only a few minutes from the already existing footage, so "Beginning" really became a new movie. But unfortunately, the whole effort of re-shooting didn't make the movie better.\n\nIn Harlin's "remake", we get a smart young priest, straight from the Vatican (James D'Arcy) who has received all the information about the buried church in advance. In "Dominion", Gabriel Mann played an innocent priest who does not expect anything terrible, he just wants to start a school in the middle of Africa. The latter was the better screenplay idea in my opinion, because D'Arcy is such a cool "professional" that we don't really care about him, whereas Mann was a character the audience loves for his human feelings. Also there is more mystery in "Domionion" whereas "Beginning" once explained the whole background, and that was it - too easy.\n\n"Beginning" has a lot more gory effects, swarms of ugly insects and its demon uses obscenities in same way Linda Blair did in the original "Exorcist" movie. This will probably entertain people who just want a horror movie and nothing else. Mind you, "Beginning" also has good photography, a few unforgettable moments like the battlefield at the beginning and good actors! But the release of the original version "Dominion" proved that the story has had more potential, Schrader worked more careful with the characters and their relationships and gave more food for thought. I voted 6/10 for "Beginning" and 8/10 for "Dominion".","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What it lacks in production values (not much) it makes up for in heart.\n\nThis type of film was often showed on the off-brand pay movie channels in the early to mid 90s but usually centered more around the exposure of many, many nude body parts belonging to Shannon Tweed, Joan Severence or C. Thomas Howell (::shudder::). This film keeps its clothes on (and puts a dress on George Clooney, to boot) and delivers an enjoyable watching experience of pure escapist fantasy throughout which you will consistently thank God you aren't Miguel's character (when he is rolling around on the ground in pain) or curse God you aren't Miguel's character (when he is rolling around in the front seat of a Volkswagon with his insanely beautiful real life wife).\n\nGood stuff.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":605,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I personally tend to like anything Adam Sandler is in and this is no exception. \n\nKevin James is his usual goofy self, Chris Rock has done better movies but is still decent in this one. David Spade was average as the whiny singleton. Rob Schneider was okay and Madison Riley as the character of his daughter OMG! Smoking Hot!!! I definitely want to see more of her! I did feel quite old (i'm only 27) when I found out that she was only 20...\n\nAll the acting was up to scratch and there were several hilarious moments.\n\nA feel good, funny, family film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":232420,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
