Overall, I think it did really well. 8 points out of 10.\n\nA few things: 1. In episode 1, there were a few mistakes that those people who are locals could easily notice. A little bit more research would've been better, but the plot/characters/etc. was good.\n\n2. Bakula's ongoing "my brother, my brother" is too much. People in NOLA don't do that, if anything they say "cher" as an affectionate term for friend, so it seemed overdone on the show.\n\n3. A little bit hard to believe in part 2, that a woman would leave a bar to walk in a dark alley alone with someone she had just met. No local would ever do that. \n\n4. I liked part 2 much more than part 1, because they focused more on places the locals go to and not just the "tourist top 10 spots" like in episode 1. I also loved how they talked about the city and it gets into your DNA. Great and well scripted.\n\n5. Love the actors and think it could be a great series going forward :)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16860,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-09-23","keywords":"usa,united states,investigation,naval officer,u.s. navy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000836/","name":"Scott Bakula","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827376/","name":"Rob Kerkovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001634/","name":"CCH Pounder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0373192/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113138/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0321782/","name":"Gary Glasberg"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"NCIS: New Orleans: The Fourth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1485290009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNkZDYwZjEtMWNlZi00Zjg5LWJhYjktYmY0NzY0ODM2NjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNkZDYwZjEtMWNlZi00Zjg5LWJhYjktYmY0NzY0ODM2NjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Promo"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">W Polsce trwa spór pomiędzy dwoma ugrupowaniami - narodowcami i ich przeciwnikami. Grzegorz Paprzycki dokumentuje przebieg tych potyczek. Pojawia się w samym środku wydarzeń, podczas których niejednokrotnie dochodzi do aktów przemocy. Film stanowi subiektywne spojrzenie na konflikt, który toczy się na polskich ulicach. Za swój obraz reżyser otrzymał Złotego Lajkonika na Krakowskim Festiwalu Filmowym.</desc>

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire. Indeed the others in their group more readily flirt and banter than the two in the title. It doesn't have a beginning, middle and end - it just has a middle. A rather interestingly filmed and quite well put together middle, but a middle nonetheless. Certainly worth watching - I think Dolan has something about him - but I wanted more from the characters and the story - as it is I just felt like a rather unsatisfied observer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-09","keywords":"gay character,friendship,kiss,in love with best friend,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707182105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8570499/","name":"Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2954178/","name":"Pier-Luc Funk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0489666/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093053/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They get stuck there.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt8366502/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ferguson-6"},"dateCreated":"2019-09-19","inLanguage":"English","name":"something to chew on","reviewBody":"Greetings again from the darkness. Filmmaker Patrick Brice is building a career on films that leave us with an unsettled, even conflicted feeling on whether we should "like" them or not. He certainly has little time for 'normal' characters, and heroic behavior rarely enters a scene. His latest is written by Sam Bain (PEEP SHOW, and son of Emmy winning director Bill Bain), and it fits perfectly into the offbeat comedy realm of Mr. Brice's previous two CREEP films (with Mark Duplass) and THE OVERNIGHT (2015).\n\nThe film kicks off was an advertisement (in the pre-production stage) for Incredible Edibles, a bio-friendly company that produces edible cutlery (a comical visual). Featured in the ad is the company's ruthless CEO Lucy, played by Demi Moore. Lucy has arranged a Team Building outing for her employees in the mountains of New Mexico. The expedition is led by Brandon (Ed Helms, THE HANGOVER), a Bear Gryllis type who easily evaluates the team's incongruent pieces. After advising against Lucy's demand for the "Advanced" trail, Brandon gives in since 'the check has cleared'. He proceeds to lead the team on a repelling adventure down into a stunning cavern.\n\nJust when it looks like the "advanced" trail was the right call, a cave-in occurs, trapping the team with no escape route, and little food or water. It's at this point when we realize that most of Lucy's management style seems to have originated in a 'get tough' management book from the 1960's. She has no real instinct on how to treat people, and mostly just bullies and tricks them. Ms. Moore's character and performance could easily be viewed as a spoof of her DISCLOSURE role with some uncomfortable laughs.

Filmmaker Patrick Brice is building a career on films that leave us with an unsettled, even conflicted feeling on whether we should "like" them or not. He certainly has little time for 'normal' characters, and heroic behavior rarely enters a scene. His latest is written by Sam Bain (PEEP SHOW, and son of Emmy winning director Bill Bain), and it fits perfectly into the offbeat comedy realm of Mr. Brice's previous two CREEP films (with Mark Duplass) and THE OVERNIGHT (2015).\n\nThe film kicks off was an advertisement (in the pre-production stage) for Incredible Edibles, a bio-friendly company that produces edible cutlery (a comical visual). Featured in the ad is the company's ruthless CEO Lucy, played by Demi Moore. Lucy has arranged a Team Building outing for her employees in the mountains of New Mexico. The expedition is led by Brandon (Ed Helms, THE HANGOVER), a Bear Gryllis type who easily evaluates the team's incongruent pieces. After advising against Lucy's demand for the "Advanced" trail, Brandon gives in since 'the check has cleared'. He proceeds to lead the team on a repelling adventure down into a stunning cavern.\n\nJust when it looks like the "advanced" trail was the right call, a cave-in occurs, trapping the team with no escape route, and little food or water. It's at this point when we realize that most of Lucy's management style seems to have originated in a 'get tough' management book from the 1960's. She has no real instinct on how to treat people, and mostly just bullies and tricks them. Ms. Moore's character and performance could easily be viewed as a spoof of her DISCLOSURE role with some uncomfortable laughs. We even get a Harvey Weinstein punchline.\n\nNoticeable right away is the terrific comedic cast. Lucy's team consists of Jess (Jessica Williams, BOOKSMART), Freddie (Karan Soni, DEADPOOL), Derek (Isiah Whitlock Jr, CEDAR RAPIDS), Gloria (Martha Kelly, "Baskets"), Billy (Dan Bakkedahl, SWORD OF TRUST), May (Jennifer Kim, "The Blacklist"), Suzy (Nasim Padrad, ALADDIN), and intern Aidan (Calum Worthy, "American Vandal"). This is an exceptionally talented group of funny people who know how to deliver a line. Some of the funniest moments are the 'throwaway' lines being uttered in between the main dialogue. That's where the real comedy gold is buried, so listen closely.\n\nAlthough the film is a comedy, it also boasts some elements of horror and suspense. Lucy's twisted idealism is the basis for some of this, as is the team's situation as things become more dire (think ALIVE blended with any workplace comedy). We learn the company is teetering on financial failure, and as one might expect in a confined area, workplace resentments and true feelings begin to rear up. The script never quite takes on business satire, focusing instead on personal reactions to a bleak situation.

Syfy and Asylum were looking to cash in on the bigger Thor picture in theaters now (apparently this Thor auditioned for that role, too; in what universe was that going to happen?) but apparently Brannagh's Thor isn't hammering the crowds, either, in real blockbuster fashion.\n\nWell, I guess this is the season for Worse rather than Norse.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2842,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":1.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2011-05-07","keywords":"marvel comics,demon,hammer,violence,fan film","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Almighty Thor","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2770189337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2UxMmQ0M2QtZjRlYS00OTYxLWE4YWUtY2JlNTBmMzMwYzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2UxMmQ0M2QtZjRlYS00OTYxLWE4YWUtY2JlNTBmMzMwYzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3382024/","name":"Cody Deal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001298/","name":"Richard Grieco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0892383/","name":"Patricia Velasquez"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712782/","name":"Christopher Ray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286790/","name":"Eric Forsberg"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her feedin the cats.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1620,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime"],"keywords":"shootout,dog,gangster,american abroad,drug addict","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crazy Six","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1447274009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlmNGIyY2YtNTg5OS00ZTU4LWJhMzgtNTNhMTliY2RjZGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlmNGIyY2YtNTg5OS00ZTU4LWJhMzgtNTNhMTliY2RjZGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sterling Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000507/","name":"Rob Lowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005522/","name":"Mario Van Peebles"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089502/","name":"Albert Pyun"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009633/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013199/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0950724/","name":"Galen Yuen"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hasselhoff's self-deprecating humor and strange otherworldly charm make him an endearing punchline, and also translates well into the world of Sci Fi Channel stardom. Sadly, after that opening scene, The Hoff all but disappears for the next 45 minutes of the film, and what starts with campy reptile-killin' fun quickly spirals into boring laboratory diatribes about the dangers of gene manipulation and the real-world uses of unlikely immortality drugs.\n\nAlthough the ads would lead one to believe otherwise, ANACONDA III actually centers on Amanda (Crystal Allen), a scientist who works for Universal Bio-Tech and the nefariousand appropriately namedMurdoch (John Rhys-Davies, obviously still fuming over not being included in the new Indiana Jones film). It seems that he's been playing God with the reptilian world and has somehow managed to create an anaconda that's not only larger and angrier than any snake on Earth, but sports a three-foot machete growing out of its tail. This Ginsu butt comes into play numerous times during the film, and while the results are always spectacularly gory, a serpent's bladed posterior is inescapably difficult to take seriously.\n\nSince all B-movie snakes carry the cure for (insert disease here), another round of unethical testing is underway, and it isn't long before our slithering behemoth breaks out of its cage, knocks off everyone but Amanda and her boss and heads out into the lush green wilderness of Romania. It's only then that Hasselhoff's Hammett and a group of ALIENS space-Marine rejects (resembling the United Colors of Benetton) are hired to eradicate the monster, which has taken up residence in a nearby farmhouse. With that, we've now got the prerequisite team of Special Ops, the cheap sets and the giant CG monster everything required for a yet another weak entry in the recent string of bland Sci Fi Channel originals.\n\nDirector Don E. FauntLeroy, who served as DP on the JEEPERS CREEPERS movies and nearly 50 other films, has managed to shoot a good-looking feature, but fills it with every painful cliché imaginable. First-time screenwriters Nicholas Davidoff and David Olson sprinkle in occasionally fun dialogue, but their script is ultimately burdened down with bland characters and extremely corny, uninspired plot twists. Hasselhoff's Hammett, a fun antihero who deserves more screen time (and one-liners), is delegated to a glorified supporting role beneath far less interesting characters. Rhys-Davies, whose cameo appearances work quite well, will hopefully receive a beefier role in ANACONDA IV (the direct sequel shot back to back with this movie, scheduled to debut this December); otherwise, he served virtually no purpose at all. It's only Allen as the spunky Amanda who breathes any life into her role; a surprise, given her lack of substantial film experience prior to headlining this one. Unfortunately, given the material, even she has trouble rising above the movie's stupendous mediocrity. When all is said and done, ANACONDA III should have been a much better film, but it also could have been much worse. The cast is sorely mismanaged, the plot is all over the board and the digital FXparticularly a handful of atrocious greenscreen driving shotsare by-and-large laughable, but the cast and crew obviously worked hard with what little they had. With any luck, this sequel's surviving characters will find more to do in the next entry, and we'll end up with a film that's not just meatier, but more entertaining. A direct-to-cable second follow-up to a creature feature headlined by J. Lo and Ice Cube doesn't need to be a masterpiece, but it should be passable as an evening's fleeting distraction. ANACONDA III is just barely that, but it's still regrettable that something as inherently amusing as David Hasselhoff fighting a giant snake couldn't have ended up just the slightest bit more fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7736,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-07-26","keywords":"anaconda,snakeskin,psychotronic film,woman wears a gas mask,snake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Anaconda III: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2085683225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDk2NDQ2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzI0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDk2NDQ2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzI0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A mercenary-for-hire accepts a mission from a billionaire to capture a dangerous snake that could possibly help cure a terminal illness."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001327/","name":"David Hasselhoff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1296597/","name":"Crystal Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1011675/","name":"Ryan McCluskey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005703/","name":"Don E.

A scientist, Susan Tyler, breeds a new bug that mimics the cockroach and wipes out the disease.  However years later something is living in New York's subways that looks human.   Tyler suspects that her breed has not died out but has evolved to imitate it's natural predator - us.

The concept itself is clever, even if the idea of bugs evolving to look very like humans is a little far fetched.  However, once the action moves to the subway the fact that the bugs are clearly lethal no matter what they look like, makes this less important.

Several people get killed by the bug that wouldn't usually get killed in this sort of horror (children for example), this is very effective as it is quite scary to see the unexpected happen.\n\nThe mood is dark throughout and Del Toro uses the sewers and subway to great effect, creating a real sense of claustrophobia - like the humans have entered the bug's world and not the other way round.  The bugs are shown early on in the film - usually not a good idea (keep it hidden in the Jaws way), but here the special effects are good enough to make the bug really believable.  However the horror is not in seeing the bugs but in they way they hunt and kill - the fear is in what could happen.  That's why seeing them doesn't take anything away.\n\nThe cast are great, Sorvino especially is very good in the lead.  Jeremy Northam and Charles S. Dutton are good in support and Abraham Murray adds a bit of cameo class (though his role is quite unnecessary).

But the director is the real star adding some genuine scares and real mood to a film that could have easily been just another creature-feature that goes straight to video and straight to the back of your mind.\n\nOverall a superior creature horror film.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1997-08-22","keywords":"giant insect,insect,disease,entomologist,cockroach","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mimic","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3387923993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMyYmE4YzktNWMwMy00NmVkLThiMDQtYTU0Yzc4OTc1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMyYmE4YzktNWMwMy00NmVkLThiMDQtYTU0Yzc4OTc1N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000227/","name":"Mira Sorvino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000562/","name":"Jeremy Northam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329422/","name":"Alexander Goodwin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0938586/","name":"Donald A.

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed.

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved.

But for Cohen fans, I don't remember hearing the song in the film, only the lyrics spoken at the beginning and end. So, much like the movie "Starman" which does not have the Bowie song, it's a bit of a bummer.\n\nIf you can get past that, no problem.\n\nThe film itself is like a blend of "The Lake House", "The Time Traveler's Wife" and "Sleeping with the Enemy" with maybe a dash of "Angel Heart" with its sexuality and diabolical symbolism. It takes a deliberately fragmented, psueudo-supernatural approach, challenging the viewer like in "The Lake House". It features a character traveling through time like in "The Time Traveler's Wife", and it revolves around a quietly abusive relationship between a man &amp; a woman like in "Sleeping with the Enemy". Throw them all together and mix vigorously with a dash of very nice jazz trumpet music, and there you have "A Thousand Kisses Deep".\n\nIt is NOT a "science fiction" as I've read in some places (why do people see "time travel" and immediately think HG Welles and Star Trek??). And it's definitely not a "romance", unless your idea of romance includes borderline rape, borderline paedophilia and something even worse which I won't ruin for you. It's not a straightforward thriller because there's not really any terror. So this film is pretty hard to classify except to say that it's the story of a woman who is trying to fix her past, present and future before it ends in disaster.\n\nBy the way, although I just threw a bunch of spooky themes at you (rape, paedophilia, etc), don't worry because the film is not explicit or graphic in any way. It implies a lot of things, but I don't think there's any nudity other than Jodie Whittaker's backside shown through a closet door. This subtle style of filmmaking is prevalent in the whole movie, which means there aren't a lot of melodramatic clichés or people shouting &amp; breaking things. What's funny is that the *lack* of action/violence makes the film even more sinister to me.\n\nAnother interesting spin is the way the story is very dreamlike--symbolic and metaphoric rather than realistic--so you don't get caught up analyzing plot details. For example, the time traveler is never recognized by any of the other characters even though you'd think they would. Also, settings don't change either, and although some characters age expectedly, others stay the same. It sets an interesting tone, as if telling us (like a dream) that certain appearances are not as important as their meaning.\n\nThis is director Dana Lustig's latest film credit (as of 2014), and I hope there are many more to come. It is one of the rare thrillers with a female perspective which I (a guy) find so much more provocative than the standard Hollywood thrillers about some dude who's steamrolling through the story trying to be cool. "A Thousand Kisses Deep" has just enough enough pauses for reflection while maintaining its momentum. Definitely give this a whirl if you're looking for a movie that's pensive yet provocative and certainly different from all the rest.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":483,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Romance","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-06-15","keywords":"four word title,title directed by female,written by director,female protagonist,abusive boyfriend","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Thousand Kisses Deep","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1763615513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for A Thousand Kisses Deep"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288976/","name":"Emilia Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092886/","name":"Jodie Whittaker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001831/","name":"David Warner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527325/","name":"Dana Lustig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293122/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476384/","name":"Alex Kustanovich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3730130/","name":"Vadim Moldovan"}],"duration":"PT1H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So this film is pretty hard to classify except to say that it's the story of a woman who is trying to fix her past, present and future before it ends in disaster.\n\nBy the way, although I just threw a bunch of spooky themes at you (rape, paedophilia, etc), don't worry because the film is not explicit or graphic in any way. It implies a lot of things, but I don't think there's any nudity other than Jodie Whittaker's backside shown through a closet door. This subtle style of filmmaking is prevalent in the whole movie, which means there aren't a lot of melodramatic clichés or people shouting &amp; breaking things. What's funny is that the *lack* of action/violence makes the film even more sinister to me.\n\nAnother interesting spin is the way the story is very dreamlike--symbolic and metaphoric rather than realistic--so you don't get caught up analyzing plot details. For example, the time traveler is never recognized by any of the other characters even though you'd think they would. Also, settings don't change either, and although some characters age expectedly, others stay the same. It sets an interesting tone, as if telling us (like a dream) that certain appearances are not as important as their meaning.\n\nThis is director Dana Lustig's latest film credit (as of 2014), and I hope there are many more to come. It is one of the rare thrillers with a female perspective which I (a guy) find so much more provocative than the standard Hollywood thrillers about some dude who's steamrolling through the story trying to be cool. "A Thousand Kisses Deep" has just enough enough pauses for reflection while maintaining its momentum. Definitely give this a whirl if you're looking for a movie that's pensive yet provocative and certainly different from all the rest.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":483,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Romance","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-06-15","keywords":"four word title,title directed by female,written by director,female protagonist,abusive boyfriend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Thousand Kisses Deep","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1763615513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlmODJlMmYtNDIzNi00OTcwLThjYzgtYTUxZDljZWQ3MTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for A Thousand Kisses Deep","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288976/","name":"Emilia Fox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092886/","name":"Jodie Whittaker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001831/","name":"David Warner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527325/","name":"Dana Lustig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293122/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476384/","name":"Alex Kustanovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3730130/","name":"Vadim Moldovan"],"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As the suspense and body count mount, the threatening desert sand (water) becomes an infinite playground for the bloodthirsty worms (sharks), as they use scare tactics against their unbeknown victims (swimmers). Not knowing where they will strike next, people tiptoe their way across town trying not to alert the creatures. It all makes for 'TREMEndous' fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130247,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1990-01-19","keywords":"desert,monster,giant worm,stranded on rooftop,first part","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911542/","name":"Fred Ward","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141617/","name":"Finn Carter"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881038/","name":"Ron Underwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033220/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079219/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934093/","name":"S.S.

This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.\n\nSet on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal.

I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.\n\nThis is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween.

The director seems to have attempted to give a couple of them more screen time with prolonged noble demises, but the shots seem more distracting than empowering. White delivers his dialogue with a heavy accent and another character is given an urban 'tude, but as in many films with large casts, the diversity seems more a result of casting decisions than screen writing choices.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-08-01","keywords":"sequel,2010s,washington state,washington,pacific northwest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"S.W.A.T.: Under Siege","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3058612249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmNjNhODYtOGUzMC00MDY5LTk2ZWUtOGIyMTI2MWNhYmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmNjNhODYtOGUzMC00MDY5LTk2ZWUtOGIyMTI2MWNhYmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415382/","name":"Sam Jaeger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1597316/","name":"Adrianne Palicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0925220/","name":"Michael Jai White"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317638/","name":"Tony Giglio"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1396586/","name":"Jonas Barnes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2600276/","name":"Keith Domingue"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I LOVE this show ! What is there NOT to like? Rich story lines, strongly portrayed (and very human) personalities you can really warm to who play off each other brilliantly, all with their own distinctive quirks and  above all  the always wonderful Mark Harmon as main character! What more could you ask for in a show?! There's not a single character I'd change  none that irritate  they're all excellent. I consider it a bonus that it's the one thing on TV that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons. Even my father-in-law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences! I was delighted when I heard that there was a second series imminent. Only problem is that living in England, who knows how long after it's shown in the US we'll get to see it!

Overall, I think it did really well. 8 points out of 10.\n\nA few things: 1. In episode 1, there were a few mistakes that those people who are locals could easily notice. A little bit more research would've been better, but the plot/characters/etc. was good.\n\n2. Bakula's ongoing "my brother, my brother" is too much. People in NOLA don't do that, if anything they say "cher" as an affectionate term for friend, so it seemed overdone on the show.\n\n3. A little bit hard to believe in part 2, that a woman would leave a bar to walk in a dark alley alone with someone she had just met. No local would ever do that. \n\n4. I liked part 2 much more than part 1, because they focused more on places the locals go to and not just the "tourist top 10 spots" like in episode 1. I also loved how they talked about the city and it gets into your DNA. Great and well scripted.\n\n5.

However, skeptics will note that most of the Asian, Hispanic and black performers are in background roles and underutilized. The director seems to have attempted to give a couple of them more screen time with prolonged noble demises, but the shots seem more distracting than empowering.

That also means another day that Sony opens up it's wallet, throws whatever small amount of money they can in other studio's faces and tells them "Go make an Open Season sequel but with less of the good humour. Oh and none of the actors from the other films." \n\nAt this point though, Sony must have honestly given up. \n\nToo content with making really huge blockbusters *coughcoughStinkers*, they decided the baton must be passed to the Canadians. And thus nearly all of the production was done in Canada, the animation (done by Rainmaker Entertainment, same ones who did Reboot back in the Mainframe days and Ratchet &amp; Clank), the voice acting (who actually do a much better job then anyone in the 3rd film though it's nothing to run home and shout about), maybe even the writing was done by Canadians.\n\nToo bad then that ever since the 3rd sequel, the franchise has ditched the word "Funny" and decided a bunch of measly Christmas cracker jokes would do instead... oh and poop jokes too, lots of em. Therefore you probably won't be laughing at anything these critters say but you'll instead be thinking "How the devil are Sony still making these?".\n\nAnd the plot's a load of codswallop too, the whole film is basically Elliot trying to scare the living daylights out of Boog.\n\nYeah, would have worked as an 8 minute cartoon, a 10 minute episode of a show or even a 22 minute TV special. But as an 87 minute film, paah ha ha ha ha you're having a laugh there chums! There's only so much they can do with this kind of material and by the time the mystery of whatever that Werewolf Elliot keeps talking about is finally revealed, the only thing you'll be doing is checking your watch.\n\nSo yeah Open Season: Scared Silly. Not as bad as the other films I've seen so far (hence why it gets the 3 rating) but still Sony, this season has gone on far enough and little old me says it's time to close it for good and let the animals have peace for once.\n\nThen again, Sony's probably not caring since they're rolling around in money like Scrooge McDuck. Beats me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-08","keywords":"nightmare,bear,deer,skunk,tubi tv","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Open Season: Scared Silly","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2534716697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTEzMzJlYzYtZWQ4ZC00MWRiLThjMzQtMGQ3NGEwODFkNjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTEzMzJlYzYtZWQ4ZC00MWRiLThjMzQtMGQ3NGEwODFkNjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Open Season: Scared Silly"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7699979/","name":"Will Townsend"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524124/","name":"Donny Lucas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3596979/","name":"Melissa Sturm"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270763/","name":"David Feiss"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0298750/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6423183/","name":"Carlos Kotkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0137811/","name":"John B.

That also means another day that Sony opens up it's wallet, throws whatever small amount of money they can in other studio's faces and tells them "Go make an Open Season sequel but with less of the good humour. Oh and none of the actors from the other films." \n\nAt this point though, Sony must have honestly given up. \n\nToo content with making really huge blockbusters *coughcoughStinkers*, they decided the baton must be passed to the Canadians. And thus nearly all of the production was done in Canada, the animation (done by Rainmaker Entertainment, same ones who did Reboot back in the Mainframe days and Ratchet &amp; Clank), the voice acting (who actually do a much better job then anyone in the 3rd film though it's nothing to run home and shout about), maybe even the writing was done by Canadians.\n\nToo bad then that ever since the 3rd sequel, the franchise has ditched the word "Funny" and decided a bunch of measly Christmas cracker jokes would do instead... oh and poop jokes too, lots of em. Therefore you probably won't be laughing at anything these critters say but you'll instead be thinking "How the devil are Sony still making these?".\n\nAnd the plot's a load of codswallop too, the whole film is basically Elliot trying to scare the living daylights out of Boog.\n\nYeah, would have worked as an 8 minute cartoon, a 10 minute episode of a show or even a 22 minute TV special. But as an 87 minute film, paah ha ha ha ha you're having a laugh there chums! There's only so much they can do with this kind of material and by the time the mystery of whatever that Werewolf Elliot keeps talking about is finally revealed, the only thing you'll be doing is checking your watch.\n\nSo yeah Open Season: Scared Silly. Not as bad as the other films I've seen so far (hence why it gets the 3 rating) but still Sony, this season has gone on far enough and little old me says it's time to close it for good and let the animals have peace for once.\n\nThen again, Sony's probably not caring since they're rolling around in money like Scrooge McDuck. Beats me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-08","keywords":"nightmare,bear,deer,skunk,tubi tv","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Open Season: Scared Silly","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2534716697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTEzMzJlYzYtZWQ4ZC00MWRiLThjMzQtMGQ3NGEwODFkNjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTEzMzJlYzYtZWQ4ZC00MWRiLThjMzQtMGQ3NGEwODFkNjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Open Season: Scared Silly","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7699979/","name":"Will Townsend","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524124/","name":"Donny Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3596979/","name":"Melissa Sturm"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270763/","name":"David Feiss"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0298750/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6423183/","name":"Carlos Kotkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0137811/","name":"John B.

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes.

Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

The same people have now made this and the same actors and characters are still here. The films are both catastrophe films, but the action is now moved to the capital Oslo. The title indicates well what is going to happen here? Unlike other movies in this genre, this attempts to convey feelings and a story about a family in dissolution. Pretty successful too, the protagonists manage to get a drama out of the situation they are in and their lives. Everything is clearly building up to the event as well as what we are going to see, namely the quake. The effects are good and perfectly done. Good sequences. The movie may be a bit of a hassle before it gets any action, but I can still recommend this movie to those who like this genre.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11042,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-08-31","keywords":"oslo norway,destruction,geology,urban setting,tunnel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2559162905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Oslo, Norway, prepares for the biggest earthquake it has seen since 1904.

The same people have now made this and the same actors and characters are still here. The films are both catastrophe films, but the action is now moved to the capital Oslo. The title indicates well what is going to happen here? Unlike other movies in this genre, this attempts to convey feelings and a story about a family in dissolution. Pretty successful too, the protagonists manage to get a drama out of the situation they are in and their lives. Everything is clearly building up to the event as well as what we are going to see, namely the quake. The effects are good and perfectly done. Good sequences. The movie may be a bit of a hassle before it gets any action, but I can still recommend this movie to those who like this genre.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11042,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-08-31","keywords":"oslo norway,destruction,geology,urban setting,tunnel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2559162905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Oslo, Norway, prepares for the biggest earthquake it has seen since 1904.

The same people have now made this and the same actors and characters are still here. The films are both catastrophe films, but the action is now moved to the capital Oslo. The title indicates well what is going to happen here? Unlike other movies in this genre, this attempts to convey feelings and a story about a family in dissolution. Pretty successful too, the protagonists manage to get a drama out of the situation they are in and their lives. Everything is clearly building up to the event as well as what we are going to see, namely the quake. The effects are good and perfectly done. Good sequences. The movie may be a bit of a hassle before it gets any action, but I can still recommend this movie to those who like this genre.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11042,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-08-31","keywords":"oslo norway,destruction,geology,urban setting,tunnel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2559162905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Oslo, Norway, prepares for the biggest earthquake it has seen since 1904.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom.

She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

The same people have now made this and the same actors and characters are still here. The films are both catastrophe films, but the action is now moved to the capital Oslo. The title indicates well what is going to happen here? Unlike other movies in this genre, this attempts to convey feelings and a story about a family in dissolution. Pretty successful too, the protagonists manage to get a drama out of the situation they are in and their lives. Everything is clearly building up to the event as well as what we are going to see, namely the quake. The effects are good and perfectly done. Good sequences. The movie may be a bit of a hassle before it gets any action, but I can still recommend this movie to those who like this genre.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11042,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-08-31","keywords":"oslo norway,destruction,geology,urban setting,tunnel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2559162905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFmOTQ5NTQtODdiZi00MTIxLWJhNzgtMjVjMDBlMjFmYmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Oslo, Norway, prepares for the biggest earthquake it has seen since 1904.

More sex, language, unreal car chases? Less plot and enough action sequences in one episode to give your brain an epileptic seizure?

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2819924, Title: Candice Renoir, 
 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen. Candice is like a female Columbo version in high heels, handbag pink scarf and a 9mm in her holster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt2819924/","name":"Candice Renoir","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM3YzUxM2UtZjIyMC00Zjg5LTk0NTMtNGQ3ZWQ0ODhlMTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0NTExNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective).

And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective).

She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland! A big yes to EXTRAS (2006) and its Homage to Love and Happy Ending!

It takes all the Luchini charm to make this guy acceptable.\n\nHe collapses on the way to work and we get into the story where, still in denial, Luchini is made to realise that he has lost his control of language, this with a major address to an executive meeting in Geneva coming up - jokes like him greeting people by saying goodbye and other malapropisms that must have given the sub-titlers nighmares.

It takes all the Luchini charm to make this guy acceptable.\n\nHe collapses on the way to work and we get into the story where, still in denial, Luchini is made to realise that he has lost his control of language, this with a major address to an executive meeting in Geneva coming up - jokes like him greeting people by saying goodbye and other malapropisms that must have given the sub-titlers nighmares. His ordering a turd from an unfazed waiter at the cafe defeats them.\n\nHe recruits hospital speech therapist Leïla Bekhti full time and starts to develop drills to restore his lost vocabulary and memory of the lay out of his district. Bored with the kids' picture books she uses he switches to the Jardin des Plantes menagerie and it's real animals.\n\nDrone shot downwards on a speeding express train and we get a King's Speech scene in Geneva which he aces bit is still shown the door.\n\nAt which point the film starts again as Luchini settles in to sort out the relationship with his daughter (that doesn't go too well) and Béhkti, before his European hiking tour accompanied by his faithful dog - much stamping of his passport and alpine scenics.

If she's a career woman, more often than not she's also obsessed with finding a man. "Family" throws those and other familiar tropes out of window. Another is the too-cute-for-own-good sidekick or child, who shows the protagonist how to be a better person. Kate (Taylor Schilling) is a mean and self-absorbed executive when she is forced to take care of her awkward neice Maddie (Bryn Vale), who'd rather be doing roundhouse karate kicks than pirouettes in ballet class. Sure, the two learn from each other, but not necessarily in ways that typical movie audiences would expect. Depending on your sensibility, this could be either refreshing or infuriating, but never boring. The cast of mostly fresh faces keep things moving along. For those looking for a comedy with more of an edge than the typical film showing at the multplex, "Family" is definitely worth a look.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2620,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-04-19","keywords":"juggalo,aunt,bullying,karate,coffee","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi531873049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NjliNDQtNmVjMi00ODA2LWIxN2QtZTBlMGMwNGJkNzgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NjliNDQtNmVjMi00ODA2LWIxN2QtZTBlMGMwNGJkNzgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An emotionally-stunted aunt tries to bond with her 13-year-old niece, who wants nothing more than to run away from home and become a juggalo."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2279940/","name":"Taylor Schilling"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6487294/","name":"Bryn Vale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3109964/","name":"Brian Tyree Henry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5144372/","name":"Laura Steinel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0579930/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5144372/","name":"Laura Steinel"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If she's a career woman, more often than not she's also obsessed with finding a man. "Family" throws those and other familiar tropes out of window. Another is the too-cute-for-own-good sidekick or child, who shows the protagonist how to be a better person. Kate (Taylor Schilling) is a mean and self-absorbed executive when she is forced to take care of her awkward neice Maddie (Bryn Vale), who'd rather be doing roundhouse karate kicks than pirouettes in ballet class. Sure, the two learn from each other, but not necessarily in ways that typical movie audiences would expect. Depending on your sensibility, this could be either refreshing or infuriating, but never boring. The cast of mostly fresh faces keep things moving along. For those looking for a comedy with more of an edge than the typical film showing at the multplex, "Family" is definitely worth a look.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2620,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-04-19","keywords":"juggalo,aunt,bullying,karate,coffee","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi531873049","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NjliNDQtNmVjMi00ODA2LWIxN2QtZTBlMGMwNGJkNzgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NjliNDQtNmVjMi00ODA2LWIxN2QtZTBlMGMwNGJkNzgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An emotionally-stunted aunt tries to bond with her 13-year-old niece, who wants nothing more than to run away from home and become a juggalo.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2279940/","name":"Taylor Schilling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6487294/","name":"Bryn Vale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3109964/","name":"Brian Tyree Henry"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5144372/","name":"Laura Steinel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0579930/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5144372/","name":"Laura Steinel"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Director George Roy Hill took a page from his successful western, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and teamed Paul Newman and Robert Redford once again, this time for an Academy Award four star movie about con men.\n\nThe intricate saga of The Sting is set in 1936 Chicago. It tells the story of grifters, Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, respectively. They con the bad guy, Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw. And at every turn, they con the audience as well.\n\nThe poker game is five card draw ('straight poker' in the film) and is set on a train traveling from New York to Chicago. Newman and Redford are on the train along with Shaw. The game has been set up by Shaw with the cooperation of the conductor. We don't know how Newman and Redford know exactly what day and what train Shaw is taking from New York to Chicago, but that is beside the purpose of our discussion. Shaw is a known card cheater, but Newman will prove to be a better one. Once again the holy game of poker will be sullied by the movies. This time, we'll love every minute of it.\n\nNewman arranges to get himself invited to the poker game, through the conductor. He arrives sober, but apparently inebriated. It is the perfect act, consummately played in a boozy, needling performance by Paul Newman. \n\nShaw's character is a known cold decker (a 'cold deck' is a deck introduced surreptitiously into the game with hands pre-arranged to break one of the players)' and Newman will have to play over the top of the cold deck when it is placed into the game.\n\nOne of the subtleties of the event is missed by most viewers. Newman must ready himself to overcome the cold deck. During the play of hands, we see Newman hold the cards close to his vest and, at least once, his cards disappear briefly below table level, out of sight, and back again. Newman knows Shaw cold decks middle cards against low cards, and so Newman is gathering and holding out jacks.\n\nNewman immediately insults Shaw upon arrival and continues to heckle him throughout the play of the game, thus making sure Shaw will cold deck the game to teach the upstart drunk a lesson. When Shaw goes to the men's room to arrange to fix the cold deck, Newman knows the time has come. (In real life, cold decks were nearly always arranged in men's rooms. They should have had a dedicated stall marked 'coolers made here'.)\n\nThe game is three handed at this point. Shaw will bring the cold deck in when he cuts the cards for the dealer to his left. In filming the cold decking, the camera shows a pair of hands over the deck, then there's a cut in the continuity. Then the camera goes immediately back to the deck and we see the hands with the warm deck going to a handkerchief in Shaw's lap, leaving the cold deck on the table. I guess it would have been hard to do in one long shot.\n\nThe detail is interesting during the dealing of the cold deck. Newman is fussing with his cigar and poking behind his vest, implying something is happening. But we never see Newman with hand positions that could be holding out cards.\n\nNewman is dealt trip threes and Shaw is dealt a pair of nines. The third player is the dealer and he is out of the hand. Newman draws two cards and gets his four threes with the six of hearts. Shaw draws three cards and gets his four nines with the ten of spades.\n\nThe planning of the arranged cold deck is well done and probable. After the cards are dealt, the cards on top of the deck are, in order, a three, the six of hearts, two nines and the ten of spades. It doesn't matter whether Newman draws one or two cards, he'll make his four threes and, in either case, Shaw, in drawing three cards, will make his four nines.\n\nNow, here's the unlikely trick. Newman must change the hand with four threes for a hand with four jacks. It would be easiest to hold out an entire hand of four jacks and a fifth card and switch five card hands. But Newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks he's held out and he keeps the six of hearts. That is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. Newman also takes the chance that Shaw won't have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines, but in having to play over the top of the cold deck, that gamble is unavoidable.\n\nShaw's problem is that he can't call Newman for card manipulation because Shaw has an audience, the other players and the conductor. After Newman leaves the cabin, Shaw says to his lackey, 'What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me, in front of the others?'\n\nShaw was able to get $10,000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. But that was okay with Newman.\n\nThe film shows Shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand, implying he has disposed of the warm deck. However, we never see Newman clean up. So, when he leaves the poker cabin, one deck is short four jacks, the other deck has four extra jacks, and Newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. Whoever the conductor gives the decks to next, will have a few surprises.\n\nDespite its faults, the poker scene from The Sting is the most fun filled, greatest directed, best acted, and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. And it was made over thirty years ago.\n\nSilver Dollar Sam NothingWild.com"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1973-12-25","keywords":"con,con man,illegal activity,playing golf,con artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717122841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001351/","name":"George Roy Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911486/","name":"David S.

    <desc lang="pl">You May Kiss the Bridesmaid: Directed by Caroline Labrèche. With Tori Anderson, Kristopher Turner, Julia Borsellino, Sarah Orenstein. Food influencer Scarlett Bailey is presented with the opportunity of a lifetime to work as a pastry chef in one of NYC's top restaurants. Her life gets put on hold when she returns to her hometown for her sister Maddie's wedding. Scarlett learns that her parents have sold the family home, a B&amp;B, to her childhood flame Liam Perry and that Maddie has lost her wedding venue days before the nuptials.

The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars.

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today.

It is trying to cram way too much into two hours and as such the characterisations suffer. It's not that you don't like or sympathise with them, it's that you don't ever feel you really know or understand them - Gael García Bernal as the equivalent of "Control" somehow lacks any menace or sophistication too. There is some beautiful photography of the island of Cuba itself, and of the Canary Islands, and it looks great, the cast look great, but it needed much more focus and much tighter plot filtration.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-01-29","keywords":"written by director,communism,cigar smoking,spy,cuba","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1948368409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkNzY0MGEtMmJjZC00Yzc2LTg5ZDAtMTc2OGUxNjAyZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkNzY0MGEtMmJjZC00Yzc2LTg5ZDAtMTc2OGUxNjAyZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on a true and gripping story: Cuban spies infiltrate exile groups in the 1990s to stop terrorism against the island, but at a high personal cost.

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2013-02-20","keywords":"based on real person,1860s,american civil war,politics,cultural conflict","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Actor","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi759866393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MzYzOTY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE5OTA3OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MzYzOTY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE5OTA3OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000358/","name":"Daniel Day-Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000398/","name":"Sally Field","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065785/","name":"Tony Kushner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329447/","name":"Doris Kearns Goodwin"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The storytelling around the lives of each soldier are built differently, but the goal here is not to explore the lives of each of them, but to understand the challenges of fighting a war in a place clearly indefensible.

    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

Extremely immersive. A incredible story with lots of emotions, conflicts, opposing moralities, and a stupefying journey. It is gripping and you will not be left unmoved.\n\nThe actors. Brit Marling and Ellen Page both give us a great performance. I was disappointed by Alexander Skarsgård, I thought that he was the weak player of the cast. The rest of the cell was pretty solid: Toby Kebbell, Shiloh Fernandez, Aldis Hodge, and Danielle Macdonald. And I should mention the nice work done by Patricia Clarkson as the director of the private security firm.\n\nThe bad. The ending is rushed. It feels like there was missing material at the end of filming and they couldn't go back to get what they needed and had to edit it with what they had.\n\nThe ugly. Nothing.\n\nThe result. A must see for anyone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,nude swimming,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

Extremely immersive. A incredible story with lots of emotions, conflicts, opposing moralities, and a stupefying journey. It is gripping and you will not be left unmoved.\n\nThe actors. Brit Marling and Ellen Page both give us a great performance. I was disappointed by Alexander Skarsgård, I thought that he was the weak player of the cast. The rest of the cell was pretty solid: Toby Kebbell, Shiloh Fernandez, Aldis Hodge, and Danielle Macdonald. And I should mention the nice work done by Patricia Clarkson as the director of the private security firm.\n\nThe bad. The ending is rushed. It feels like there was missing material at the end of filming and they couldn't go back to get what they needed and had to edit it with what they had.\n\nThe ugly. Nothing.\n\nThe result. A must see for anyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,nude swimming,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

Wont be watching any more episodes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3066,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-26","keywords":"doctor,hospital,emergency room,syrian refugee,brother sister relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4407744/","name":"Hamza Haq","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495799/","name":"Laurence Leboeuf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0689402/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0120262/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0216142/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1075746/","name":"Joseph Kay"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Transplant: Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2522791449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZiZTliYjktZjlhYi00ZjM1LTk2N2UtODYwYzI4YzA2ZWIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZiZTliYjktZjlhYi00ZjM1LTk2N2UtODYwYzI4YzA2ZWIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Transplant: Season 1"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Zieja</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 10136434, Title: Zieja, 
 --- Description: Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

So this series was exactly what I needed right now.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Documentary","Biography"],"datePublished":"2020-10-04","keywords":"first lady of the united states of america,u.s. president,politician's wife,the white house,american politics","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000705/","name":"Robin Wright","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0617356/","name":"Kati Marton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7248272/","name":"Kate Andersen Brower"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0112302/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165168/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi586203417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQxMmFmMDctMjlmNy00ZTVmLWFiODUtZjY5NmM3MDcwMmY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQxMmFmMDctMjlmNy00ZTVmLWFiODUtZjY5NmM3MDcwMmY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland! A big yes to EXTRAS (2006) and its Homage to Love and Happy Ending! However in this enthusiastic farce, most of deductions seem absurd - for instance it is clear that if the Chinese director announces that, "Poland is second China and China is second Poland", the Polish photographer replies, "The situation is not good in Poland!!!" The absurdity is resonated in the duologue's of the melodrama they're shooting. The alienated Polish characters and enhancement of their relationship during the work are phenomenally inspiring, but the Chinese stereotypes - especially the childish director with his beloved goldfish - are not convincing at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"town","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695835/","name":"Kinga Preis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115711/","name":"Stanislaw Brudny"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452609/","name":"Krzysztof Kiersznowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477187/","name":"Michal Kwiecinski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034872/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland! A big yes to EXTRAS (2006) and its Homage to Love and Happy Ending! However in this enthusiastic farce, most of deductions seem absurd - for instance it is clear that if the Chinese director announces that, "Poland is second China and China is second Poland", the Polish photographer replies, "The situation is not good in Poland!!!" The absurdity is resonated in the duologue's of the melodrama they're shooting. The alienated Polish characters and enhancement of their relationship during the work are phenomenally inspiring, but the Chinese stereotypes - especially the childish director with his beloved goldfish - are not convincing at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"town","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695835/","name":"Kinga Preis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115711/","name":"Stanislaw Brudny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452609/","name":"Krzysztof Kiersznowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477187/","name":"Michal Kwiecinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034872/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It takes all the Luchini charm to make this guy acceptable.\n\nHe collapses on the way to work and we get into the story where, still in denial, Luchini is made to realise that he has lost his control of language, this with a major address to an executive meeting in Geneva coming up - jokes like him greeting people by saying goodbye and other malapropisms that must have given the sub-titlers nighmares. His ordering a turd from an unfazed waiter at the cafe defeats them.\n\nHe recruits hospital speech therapist Leïla Bekhti full time and starts to develop drills to restore his lost vocabulary and memory of the lay out of his district. Bored with the kids' picture books she uses he switches to the Jardin des Plantes menagerie and it's real animals.\n\nDrone shot downwards on a speeding express train and we get a King's Speech scene in Geneva which he aces bit is still shown the door.\n\nAt which point the film starts again as Luchini settles in to sort out the relationship with his daughter (that doesn't go too well) and Béhkti, before his European hiking tour accompanied by his faithful dog - much stamping of his passport and alpine scenics. The scene setting is particularly deft in this one.\n\nThe central performance is superior but when they've set up support players so well it's unsatisfying to not find their stories given an outcome.\n\nLush feel good European movie of the kind that plays well in English speaking country art theaters."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-11-07","keywords":"reference to montgomery clift,reference to gregory peck,reference to peter lorre,reference to humphrey bogart,vehicle design","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi247118361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlZjNlMzctY2I3Yi00ZmE2LTgwZTQtYzM4ZDAzMmFmNzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlZjNlMzctY2I3Yi00ZmE2LTgwZTQtYzM4ZDAzMmFmNzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1871951/","name":"Leïla Bekhti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2406198/","name":"Rebecca Marder"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1773597/","name":"Hervé Mimran"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315631/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1773597/","name":"Hervé Mimran"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277229/","name":"Hélène Fillières"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7013534/","name":"Christian Streiff"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It takes all the Luchini charm to make this guy acceptable.\n\nHe collapses on the way to work and we get into the story where, still in denial, Luchini is made to realise that he has lost his control of language, this with a major address to an executive meeting in Geneva coming up - jokes like him greeting people by saying goodbye and other malapropisms that must have given the sub-titlers nighmares. His ordering a turd from an unfazed waiter at the cafe defeats them.\n\nHe recruits hospital speech therapist Leïla Bekhti full time and starts to develop drills to restore his lost vocabulary and memory of the lay out of his district. Bored with the kids' picture books she uses he switches to the Jardin des Plantes menagerie and it's real animals.\n\nDrone shot downwards on a speeding express train and we get a King's Speech scene in Geneva which he aces bit is still shown the door.\n\nAt which point the film starts again as Luchini settles in to sort out the relationship with his daughter (that doesn't go too well) and Béhkti, before his European hiking tour accompanied by his faithful dog - much stamping of his passport and alpine scenics. The scene setting is particularly deft in this one.\n\nThe central performance is superior but when they've set up support players so well it's unsatisfying to not find their stories given an outcome.\n\nLush feel good European movie of the kind that plays well in English speaking country art theaters.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-11-07","keywords":"reference to montgomery clift,reference to gregory peck,reference to peter lorre,reference to humphrey bogart,vehicle design","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi247118361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlZjNlMzctY2I3Yi00ZmE2LTgwZTQtYzM4ZDAzMmFmNzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlZjNlMzctY2I3Yi00ZmE2LTgwZTQtYzM4ZDAzMmFmNzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1871951/","name":"Leïla Bekhti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2406198/","name":"Rebecca Marder"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1773597/","name":"Hervé Mimran"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315631/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1773597/","name":"Hervé Mimran","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277229/","name":"Hélène Fillières","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7013534/","name":"Christian Streiff"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Po latach rozpoczęła walkę o odzyskanie kontroli nad swoim życiem, w czym wspierają ją rzesze fanów. Stoją oni murem za piosenkarką i twierdzą, że powinna sama o sobie decydować. Autorzy dokumentu pokazują kulisy prawnej batalii, jaką Britney Spears toczy ze swoim ojcem Jamesem. Stawką jest sprawowanie kurateli nad gwiazdą i zarządzanie jej majątkiem.</desc>

Director George Roy Hill took a page from his successful western, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and teamed Paul Newman and Robert Redford once again, this time for an Academy Award four star movie about con men.\n\nThe intricate saga of The Sting is set in 1936 Chicago. It tells the story of grifters, Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, respectively. They con the bad guy, Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw. And at every turn, they con the audience as well.\n\nThe poker game is five card draw ('straight poker' in the film) and is set on a train traveling from New York to Chicago. Newman and Redford are on the train along with Shaw. The game has been set up by Shaw with the cooperation of the conductor. We don't know how Newman and Redford know exactly what day and what train Shaw is taking from New York to Chicago, but that is beside the purpose of our discussion. Shaw is a known card cheater, but Newman will prove to be a better one. Once again the holy game of poker will be sullied by the movies. This time, we'll love every minute of it.\n\nNewman arranges to get himself invited to the poker game, through the conductor. He arrives sober, but apparently inebriated. It is the perfect act, consummately played in a boozy, needling performance by Paul Newman. \n\nShaw's character is a known cold decker (a 'cold deck' is a deck introduced surreptitiously into the game with hands pre-arranged to break one of the players)' and Newman will have to play over the top of the cold deck when it is placed into the game.\n\nOne of the subtleties of the event is missed by most viewers. Newman must ready himself to overcome the cold deck. During the play of hands, we see Newman hold the cards close to his vest and, at least once, his cards disappear briefly below table level, out of sight, and back again. Newman knows Shaw cold decks middle cards against low cards, and so Newman is gathering and holding out jacks.\n\nNewman immediately insults Shaw upon arrival and continues to heckle him throughout the play of the game, thus making sure Shaw will cold deck the game to teach the upstart drunk a lesson. When Shaw goes to the men's room to arrange to fix the cold deck, Newman knows the time has come. (In real life, cold decks were nearly always arranged in men's rooms. They should have had a dedicated stall marked 'coolers made here'.)\n\nThe game is three handed at this point. Shaw will bring the cold deck in when he cuts the cards for the dealer to his left. In filming the cold decking, the camera shows a pair of hands over the deck, then there's a cut in the continuity. Then the camera goes immediately back to the deck and we see the hands with the warm deck going to a handkerchief in Shaw's lap, leaving the cold deck on the table. I guess it would have been hard to do in one long shot.\n\nThe detail is interesting during the dealing of the cold deck. Newman is fussing with his cigar and poking behind his vest, implying something is happening. But we never see Newman with hand positions that could be holding out cards.\n\nNewman is dealt trip threes and Shaw is dealt a pair of nines. The third player is the dealer and he is out of the hand. Newman draws two cards and gets his four threes with the six of hearts. Shaw draws three cards and gets his four nines with the ten of spades.\n\nThe planning of the arranged cold deck is well done and probable. After the cards are dealt, the cards on top of the deck are, in order, a three, the six of hearts, two nines and the ten of spades. It doesn't matter whether Newman draws one or two cards, he'll make his four threes and, in either case, Shaw, in drawing three cards, will make his four nines.\n\nNow, here's the unlikely trick. Newman must change the hand with four threes for a hand with four jacks. It would be easiest to hold out an entire hand of four jacks and a fifth card and switch five card hands. But Newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks he's held out and he keeps the six of hearts. That is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. Newman also takes the chance that Shaw won't have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines, but in having to play over the top of the cold deck, that gamble is unavoidable.\n\nShaw's problem is that he can't call Newman for card manipulation because Shaw has an audience, the other players and the conductor. After Newman leaves the cabin, Shaw says to his lackey, 'What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me, in front of the others?'\n\nShaw was able to get $10,000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. But that was okay with Newman.\n\nThe film shows Shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand, implying he has disposed of the warm deck. However, we never see Newman clean up. So, when he leaves the poker cabin, one deck is short four jacks, the other deck has four extra jacks, and Newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. Whoever the conductor gives the decks to next, will have a few surprises.\n\nDespite its faults, the poker scene from The Sting is the most fun filled, greatest directed, best acted, and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. And it was made over thirty years ago.\n\nSilver Dollar Sam NothingWild.com"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1973-12-25","keywords":"con,con man,illegal activity,playing golf,con artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717122841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001351/","name":"George Roy Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911486/","name":"David S.

Director George Roy Hill took a page from his successful western, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and teamed Paul Newman and Robert Redford once again, this time for an Academy Award four star movie about con men.\n\nThe intricate saga of The Sting is set in 1936 Chicago.

The first, and main problem, was the story. There were some times when it bared some resemblance to one of the best children's books ever written, up there with Peter Pan and the Hans Christian Anderson Fairy tales, for imagination and complexity. However, I especially disliked the dog meat factory subplot, that's where it got really clumsy and it made the climax feel really cluttered. The songs were also nothing to write home about. They were fun to listen to (especially the Weasel song), but they were definitely forgettable. The direction, by I think Terry Jones(also actor), lacked at times the director's usual silliness and fun. There were some scenes, like the train scene where the action felt a bit rushed. However, there were a number of redeeming qualities to the film. Some scenes, like the introduction to Rat, were beautifully shot, and reminded me of Three Men in a Boat. The sets and scenery are very colourful and pretty and the costumes didn't bother me all that much, admittedly though some of the special effects were so-so. The script was good, very witty at times, with some priceless lines especially with Toad, Badger and St John, while maintaining the book's gentleness and drollness which I liked. The performances were in general excellent especially Nicol Williamson as Badger, who brought a much needed gruffness to the character as well as having a gift for comedy. Steve Coogan was touching as Mole. Eric Idle and Terry Jones were very funny in their roles, Idle is wonderfully sympathetic and jovial while Jones has a ball as the juiciest character. The courtroom scene was hilarious because of Toad's increasingly silly breaking-into- song moments, and was the highlight of the film. John Cleese and Stephen Fry were good(Cleese especially), but their appearances were too brief. Anthony Sher was adequately menacing as Chief Weasel, but like everyone else involved, he has been better. All in all, a likable, colourful and funny but unfortunately at times clumsy film, with a 7/10.

I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.\n\nAs I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.\n\nThis movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.\n\nThis film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.\n\nEven though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.\n\nMy Grade: A-","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":311899,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-06-20","keywords":"neo noir,private detective,femme fatale,detective,police","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chinatown","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220411673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0NzViNDYtMzQ1My00NTlhLWJjYzEtNTNhNjZiZDczN2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0NzViNDYtMzQ1My00NTlhLWJjYzEtNTNhNjZiZDczN2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000197/","name":"Jack Nicholson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001159/","name":"Faye Dunaway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001379/","name":"John Huston"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001235/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044146/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001801/","name":"Robert Towne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.\n\nAs I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman.

This one was pretty decent, I really liked the calm pace and slow burning tension which were the defining characteristics of this film. Performances were great, Alvydas Anusauskas shined through everything, and, in contrast to what other cinefiles has said, I loved the performance of Marius Elijas Povilas Martynenko, his microexpressions were delivered wonderfully, in my humble opinion, his unexpressive possition fits the role perfectly and made the whole film feel like a great spectacle - yes, we are so used to Lithuanian actors bombarding us with feelings, emotions and expression in their faces, but I just felt relieved that finally we have a real human being in that sovietic world. Finally someone who I can relate to.\n\nNow, let's talk about the things which made me cringe and feel unamused. First of all, the film essentialy was plotless, seriuously, there is no plot, just faces, dialogues, (which weren't perfect either and at times seemed to drawn out and way too silly) some wandering around, some shooting, hiding, some crying and deaths. That's it. There's nothing else you can hook on to and you just wait those two hours for something to happen. I waited waited and waited and nothing real happened.\n\nLithuanians like to say how Hollywood films have this hollywoodish dramatism in them. Well, I have to say that Lithaunian films have some Lithuanian-ish dramatism in them. Before I die, Imma just sing a few lines of that sad melancholic song I once heard; yeah, why not. So, a partizan sings a song and then shoots himself, whilst all of his friends are already dead. How clever. How realistic. You know what, why don't we also put some sad violin music in the background while partizans are being shot down one by one. Yeah, cool, let's do that, let's just ruin the moment. And lastly why don't we just make every person's relation to others extremely difficult so that our audience would not manage to fully understand it. A man is murdered by the soviet dogs whilst trying to escape, his wife is raped. But did soviets really do that? Well, I don't know, because I couldn't actually realise what was happening.

This one was pretty decent, I really liked the calm pace and slow burning tension which were the defining characteristics of this film. Performances were great, Alvydas Anusauskas shined through everything, and, in contrast to what other cinefiles has said, I loved the performance of Marius Elijas Povilas Martynenko, his microexpressions were delivered wonderfully, in my humble opinion, his unexpressive possition fits the role perfectly and made the whole film feel like a great spectacle - yes, we are so used to Lithuanian actors bombarding us with feelings, emotions and expression in their faces, but I just felt relieved that finally we have a real human being in that sovietic world. Finally someone who I can relate to.\n\nNow, let's talk about the things which made me cringe and feel unamused. First of all, the film essentialy was plotless, seriuously, there is no plot, just faces, dialogues, (which weren't perfect either and at times seemed to drawn out and way too silly) some wandering around, some shooting, hiding, some crying and deaths. That's it. There's nothing else you can hook on to and you just wait those two hours for something to happen. I waited waited and waited and nothing real happened.\n\nLithuanians like to say how Hollywood films have this hollywoodish dramatism in them. Well, I have to say that Lithaunian films have some Lithuanian-ish dramatism in them. Before I die, Imma just sing a few lines of that sad melancholic song I once heard; yeah, why not. So, a partizan sings a song and then shoots himself, whilst all of his friends are already dead. How clever. How realistic. You know what, why don't we also put some sad violin music in the background while partizans are being shot down one by one. Yeah, cool, let's do that, let's just ruin the moment. And lastly why don't we just make every person's relation to others extremely difficult so that our audience would not manage to fully understand it. A man is murdered by the soviet dogs whilst trying to escape, his wife is raped. But did soviets really do that? Well, I don't know, because I couldn't actually realise what was happening. And how, why did Unte get here? Where's the logic? Well, I don't know and I should't care about that, I should just enjoy the film, right? Wrong.\n\nBy the way, I couldn't help but notice every single time there were dirty hands or dirty fingernails or both shown on the screen.

I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.\n\nAs I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.\n\nThis movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.\n\nThis film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.\n\nEven though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction.

I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.\n\nAs I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.\n\nThis movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.\n\nThis film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.\n\nEven though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch.

(DIR: Alexander Payne)\n\nA truly vintage comedy. Paul Giamatti is one of our finest character actors who seems to be neck-and-neck with William H. Macy on cornering the market of portraying losers as a cottage industry and in the latest endeavor of hapless misanthropes he may have found Oscar gold.\n\nGiamatti stars as Miles Raymond, a miserable mope of a man who realizes he is never going to amount to anything especially given the fact that he is his own worst enemy in his highly critical outlook on life particularly on two things he holds dear: his struggling attempts to become a writer of notice and his taste in wine. The latter leads him to a certain road trip to salvation when he embarks upon a few days of r&amp;r away from his stagnant day job as a middle school English teacher with his best friend and former college roomie Jack (Church in easily the career defining role of his life since his hey day on the TV sitcom 'Wings') whose impending nuptials is Miles' wedding gift as the best man. Jack, a long-in-the tooth second-rate soap actor whose 15 minutes are at a close 14:59 is adamant about getting laid for one last time before his commitment to a younger woman who clearly deserves better (and Jack shrewdly knows this).\n\nAs the duo drive through the sun-dappled wine country of Northern California in a road trip not unlike two virginal, horny teens looking to pop their respective cherries, they come across two unlikely conquests. One is the shapely and surprisingly-down-to-earth waitress Maya (Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom) who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie (the sublimely, reassuringly funny Oh, and real  life wife to director Payne) who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack.

(DIR: Alexander Payne)\n\nA truly vintage comedy. Paul Giamatti is one of our finest character actors who seems to be neck-and-neck with William H. Macy on cornering the market of portraying losers as a cottage industry and in the latest endeavor of hapless misanthropes he may have found Oscar gold.\n\nGiamatti stars as Miles Raymond, a miserable mope of a man who realizes he is never going to amount to anything especially given the fact that he is his own worst enemy in his highly critical outlook on life particularly on two things he holds dear: his struggling attempts to become a writer of notice and his taste in wine. The latter leads him to a certain road trip to salvation when he embarks upon a few days of r&amp;r away from his stagnant day job as a middle school English teacher with his best friend and former college roomie Jack (Church in easily the career defining role of his life since his hey day on the TV sitcom 'Wings') whose impending nuptials is Miles' wedding gift as the best man. Jack, a long-in-the tooth second-rate soap actor whose 15 minutes are at a close 14:59 is adamant about getting laid for one last time before his commitment to a younger woman who clearly deserves better (and Jack shrewdly knows this).\n\nAs the duo drive through the sun-dappled wine country of Northern California in a road trip not unlike two virginal, horny teens looking to pop their respective cherries, they come across two unlikely conquests. One is the shapely and surprisingly-down-to-earth waitress Maya (Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom) who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie (the sublimely, reassuringly funny Oh, and real  life wife to director Payne) who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack. What unfolds is a sweet yet too-good-to-be true few days of bliss and unbridled emotional rescue for the foursome as they take to one another like ducks to water although Miles' hesitancy is deeply reasoned since he is still licking the open wounds of his two-year old divorce.\n\nPayne, one of my favorite filmmakers, doesn't disappoint as he dollops evenly the tragic-comic proceedings with his frequent long-time collaborator Jim Taylor in adapting an unpublished novel by Rex Pickett that has many layers to it and doesn't betray its four intriguing and ultimately human characters with all their flaws and neuroses on full display. Each actor shines with a few moments of soliloquies and dialogue that ring true that will have you laughing til you cry and vice versa (and that my friend is no easy trick)!\n\nThe four actors give supremely wonderfully acted turns and all are Oscar worthy as well as the screenplay which mixes misery with hope and some truly funny moments including an anger management golf sequence that feels like an outtake from 'Caddyshack' and Giamatti's drunken phone call to his ex is on par with Jon Favreau's car-accident-in-slow-motion answering machine mishap in 'Swingers'  one for the archives.

The beginning is amazing, and the way we gradually know the different characters, how they are related to each other, and their lives is very engaging. Their existences are far from desired and they want to be somewhere else: if the needed profit will come from a new work or through a great crime, that will vary. Indeed, borders between crime and honest work are not always so rigid, and both are neighbors.

The beginning is amazing, and the way we gradually know the different characters, how they are related to each other, and their lives is very engaging. Their existences are far from desired and they want to be somewhere else: if the needed profit will come from a new work or through a great crime, that will vary. Indeed, borders between crime and honest work are not always so rigid, and both are neighbors. Action scenes are as good as the daily routine ones, and here I saw one of the very best shooting footage. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that there are too many side stories which are not developped until the end, and some kmportant events are never explained or are just forgotten.

Nevertheless, it asks very important political questions regarding individual duties, submission to law and the state, and even philosophical conceptions of what should be a good life and the integrity of conformism. Though, to me, the movie lacks nuance and finess to the profit of a radical approach that does a good job highlighting the main themes and questions of its plot, but which also makes it a bit too extreme and often clunky.\n\nOn a technical level, the movie is well shot, with a very eye pleasing cinematography by Sophie Dersape herself. I'm not as much of a fan of the editing and directing (both also from Deraspe), which can be quite ostentatious and even seem a bit forced from time to time, like she's trying a bit too hard.

The story is centrally about an unlikely relationship between two young women. That's as much as you need to know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the depth of field was above average even for a studio production. As an independent film, the photography earns extra points. The production was shot on location so we can't talk about set design. However, the costumes and staging were pretty spectacular too.\n\nI was a little disappointed to learn the film was dual-chromatic. Meaning the producers and director essentially shot both in color and non-color before deciding which cut to release. The film wasn't exclusively crafted as a black and white film. On the upside though, the director obviously took care enough to ensure everything contrasted well in black and white from the beginning. The contrast is very well done and obviously extensively planned.\n\nThe best part of the film is probably the performances though. Kara Hayward steals the show in my opinion. However, there is such a long list of supporting roles it's hard to say which one is best. Liana Liberato deserves a mention as an essential co-star but the list really doesn't end there. If I had to level any criticism, I'd say the male performances didn't really keep up.\n\nThe difference probably relates more to writing than how the actors were portrayed but the difference is noticeable. All the male characters, with maybe one exception, are decidedly two dimensional. The female characters, whether by acting or writing, display a lot more depth and interest for the viewer. The distinction was obviously intentional. However, there is a problem.\n\nWithout giving anything away, the sheer volume of depth almost overwhelms the film at some points. I feel as though there were too many interesting plot lines to explore. The film might have accomplished more with less. Instead, I encountered some odd cropped scenes where you're left wondering where some of the ideas came or went.\n\nNot exactly continuity glitches. More like questions left hanging. I won't tell you the details. Suffices to say though, the climax of the film ends up feeling a bit rushed and most of the sub-plots leave the film feeling inconclusive. One loose end was certainly intentional. However, I'm talking about the film as a whole.\n\nGo watch and enjoy. The film is a lot more successful than not.

It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, "The Body" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.\n\nFirst of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. "Stand By Me" fits what the characters in the story are facing.  I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to.  All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a "bad kid." And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.\n\nTo me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.\n\nThis film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":382388,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1986-08-22","keywords":"friendship,childhood,coming of age film,walking on train tracks,summertime","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stand By Me","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284829721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000696/","name":"Wil Wheaton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000203/","name":"River Phoenix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000397/","name":"Corey Feldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015549/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317279/","name":"Raynold Gideon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262595/","name":"Bruce A.

Its content took on a form and dose of humor, and by that I've got the reason to stay and watch it further. Is it about the question of the real picture of American family and culture, and their values? Well, probably mainly. However, without extraordinary Kyle Gallner's acting the movie would be empty.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1780,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2021-01-21","keywords":"love","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1346027545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIxYzBlODMtOTA4NS00ZTRlLTliMWEtZGNkNTU0YTA3NjE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIxYzBlODMtOTA4NS00ZTRlLTliMWEtZGNkNTU0YTA3NjE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973177/","name":"Kyle Gallner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3473431/","name":"Yancey Fuqua","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2843808/","name":"Jennifer Kincer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0716814/","name":"Adam Rehmeier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0583678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0574133/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0391437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0716814/","name":"Adam Rehmeier"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own ("Old spor'!") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.\n\nBut I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.\n\nGatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.\n\nUnfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).\n\nLuhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose.

 --- Description: The Great Gatsby: Directed by Baz Luhrmann. With Lisa Adam, Frank Aldridge, Amitabh Bachchan, Steve Bisley. A writer and wall street trader, Nick, finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1343092/","name":"The Great Gatsby","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNTk1ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI1OTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A writer and wall street trader, Nick, finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1343092/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"prameetkumar","dateCreated":"2013-05-10","inLanguage":"English","name":""I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity."","reviewBody":"I watched this film with a sort of tender curiosity.\n\nIt was deliciously excessive and exaggerated, as expected from a Baz Luhrmann production. Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own ("Old spor'!") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.\n\nBut I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.\n\nGatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.\n\nUnfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).\n\nLuhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But those scenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst) as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of "The Great Gatsby."\n\nI wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderful qualities.

Jennifer Lawrence gives an Oscar Worthy performance as Rolly Dee. I was surprised how excellent she was, because I was sceptical of her in the "The Bill Engvall" show. But she turned me to a believer and boy, she can REALLY act. Her performance actually surpasses some of Meryl Streep's performances. Hopefully the Academy will recognize her and give an Oscar nomination or maybe even a win! The film is well directed by Debra Granik and is easily her best work yet.

Based on the real-life work of forensic anthropologist and novelist Kathy Reichs, it's fun, kicky, and only occasionally too gruesome to look at. Not quite like one of Ms. Reichs' novels, it is still a pleasure for a fan (me!) to watch. Boreanaz' past work on Buffy and Angel stands in good stead here as he delivers lines that stand up to a strong female role without diminishing it. Also like Buffy, humor lends grace to embarrassing social situations that highlight common human vulnerabilities. Surrounding the 2 major players are other characters who add to the thrust of a character driven show. The writers do good work giving each character unique attributes that have nothing to do with hair color or body measurements. The entire cast does a good job presenting real, quirky individuals who don't have to rely on looks to sell the worth of their character to the viewers. That alone is something new for any CSI show. Still some rough edges in writing and delivery (Tempe's "I wish this was the worst I have seen" was painful for all the wrong reasons),"Bones" has great potential.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148714,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-09-13","keywords":"forensic anthropologist,investigation,washington d.c.,crime scene investigation,murder investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0221043/","name":"Emily Deschanel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004770/","name":"David Boreanaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174819/","name":"Michaela Conlin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0212869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0361274/","name":"Hart Hanson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bones: The Complete Seventh Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi748140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bones: The Complete Seventh Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action.

Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it.

Story more important than special effects or pointless action sequences (always a plus for me). 5. Sound effects, usually unappreciated in non-action films, well used to add to the intensity of the drama.\n\nMinuses: 1. We've probably all seen John Goodman play a similar character before. 2. There's a possible murder that took place prior to the film, a plot device never resolved.\n\nSince the film has the word "Cloverfield" in the title, a lot of dim light bulbs thought this was a prequel or sequel to the other film and bad mouthed it because it isn't. Using Cloverfield in the title was likely just another reference to a favorite film.\n\nSome people didn't understand the ending. Huh? They must have fallen asleep during the rest of the movie (when they realized it wasn't Cloverfield 2) or this generation is dumber than I fear it might be. The actions of Winstead's character at the end of the film make perfect sense in light of a monologue she delivered earlier, which apparently was ignored by those whining about the ending.\n\nDon't listen to the naysayers. It isn't high art, but it's an entertaining film that will hold your attention to the end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":308336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2016-03-30","keywords":"bunker,kidnapping,alien,minimal cast,alien invasion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2229122329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Waking up from a car accident, a young woman finds herself in the basement of a man who says he's saved her life from a chemical attack that has left the outside uninhabitable."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0302330/","name":"John Gallagher Jr."}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870469/","name":"Dan Trachtenberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021593/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045450/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1061091/","name":"Josh Campbell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1173295/","name":"Matthew Stuecken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3227090/","name":"Damien Chazelle"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sound effects, usually unappreciated in non-action films, well used to add to the intensity of the drama.\n\nMinuses: 1. We've probably all seen John Goodman play a similar character before. 2. There's a possible murder that took place prior to the film, a plot device never resolved.\n\nSince the film has the word "Cloverfield" in the title, a lot of dim light bulbs thought this was a prequel or sequel to the other film and bad mouthed it because it isn't. Using Cloverfield in the title was likely just another reference to a favorite film.\n\nSome people didn't understand the ending. Huh? They must have fallen asleep during the rest of the movie (when they realized it wasn't Cloverfield 2) or this generation is dumber than I fear it might be. The actions of Winstead's character at the end of the film make perfect sense in light of a monologue she delivered earlier, which apparently was ignored by those whining about the ending.\n\nDon't listen to the naysayers. It isn't high art, but it's an entertaining film that will hold your attention to the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":308336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2016-03-30","keywords":"bunker,kidnapping,alien,minimal cast,alien invasion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2229122329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Waking up from a car accident, a young woman finds herself in the basement of a man who says he's saved her life from a chemical attack that has left the outside uninhabitable.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0302330/","name":"John Gallagher Jr."],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870469/","name":"Dan Trachtenberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021593/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045450/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1061091/","name":"Josh Campbell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1173295/","name":"Matthew Stuecken","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3227090/","name":"Damien Chazelle"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The scenes and animation is breathtaking. I liked that very much.\n\nHere's a controversial opinion; I quite liked the music and songs as well though It lacks the iconic catchy tunes from the first one.\n\nMy biggest complaint and the one thing that let this down is the story. Its way too simplistic.

Everything about it is there to make you feel the triumphs and defeats everyone goes through on the path to victory. For that reason, the story goes where you think it would. It hits all those beats in both drama, comedy, suspense, and scenes trying to get you to cry with the characters. That's not necessarily a bad thing because it's 100% expected going in. It does take away from the movie, though, and it might be its biggest weakness. Still, the story is very enjoyable. Which makes sense for its extremely high rating of 90% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Some of the writing isn't as good as it could be, falling into cliches. But there are some scenes that work well with the characters. If you're gonna watch the movie for anything, it's Toni Collette. Her portrayal of Jan is fun and just the right central character needed. I don't know. There's not much more to be said. It's predictable and cheesy, but that's all part of the experience. I like Dream Horse and it's a quality movie to watch if you want to watch something with heart.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3131,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-06-04","keywords":"triumph of the human spirit,underdog story,horse trainer,horse race,singing on a bus","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi686014489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ0ZmRmOGEtZjJhNi00MThjLWEzNzgtMGQ2NjQwNzYwZjkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ0ZmRmOGEtZjJhNi00MThjLWEzNzgtMGQ2NjQwNzYwZjkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Dream Alliance is an unlikely race horse bred by small-town Welsh bartender Jan Vokes.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":342504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,tape over mouth,tough woman,italy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mission: Impossible III","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1587151129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157358/","name":"Michelle Monaghan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":342504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,tape over mouth,tough woman,italy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mission: Impossible III","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1587151129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157358/","name":"Michelle Monaghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.\n\nChanning Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.\n\nLike Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.\n\nAs du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.\n\nFoxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

Family movie about a teenage boy whose parents fight so much he's had enough. At school, he and his adoptable friend are talented love matchmakers. These two are presented with challenges, see opportunity and act upon it. .. Much to the benefit of their friends. But when the boy stages the plan to separate his parents, wanting to make his own life better, she is conflicted. And that's the core of the movie. What I was absolutely not expecting, yet amazingly surprised and gripped by, was the depth of feelings and connections expressed between each and all of these characters. The writing was fluid. Conversations were easy, natural, and enjoyable even when their content was difficult. Each scene had a purpose and I was always curious what would happen next? Watching our scope of freedom building, I was afraid of where I thought this might lead. I feel these choices could've been inspired by somebody's real life choices. In the end, satisfied and smiling, I feel I have a better understanding of other people's relationships, desires, and motivations. Few other shows have moved me like Breaking Them Up moved me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2021-11-11","keywords":"friend","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Breaking Them Up","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3283075865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNlNWY3MzMtNTBiOC00MzA5LWJkMzMtMTlhNmUwNjQyODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNlNWY3MzMtNTBiOC00MzA5LWJkMzMtMTlhNmUwNjQyODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1447142/","name":"Stephen Schneider"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2584298/","name":"Kelen Coleman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5059328/","name":"Jakob Wedel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3438843/","name":"Scott Dow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3528615/","name":"Dev Wadhwa"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Family movie about a teenage boy whose parents fight so much he's had enough. At school, he and his adoptable friend are talented love matchmakers. These two are presented with challenges, see opportunity and act upon it. .. Much to the benefit of their friends. But when the boy stages the plan to separate his parents, wanting to make his own life better, she is conflicted. And that's the core of the movie. What I was absolutely not expecting, yet amazingly surprised and gripped by, was the depth of feelings and connections expressed between each and all of these characters. The writing was fluid. Conversations were easy, natural, and enjoyable even when their content was difficult. Each scene had a purpose and I was always curious what would happen next? Watching our scope of freedom building, I was afraid of where I thought this might lead. I feel these choices could've been inspired by somebody's real life choices. In the end, satisfied and smiling, I feel I have a better understanding of other people's relationships, desires, and motivations. Few other shows have moved me like Breaking Them Up moved me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2021-11-11","keywords":"friend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Breaking Them Up","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3283075865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNlNWY3MzMtNTBiOC00MzA5LWJkMzMtMTlhNmUwNjQyODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNlNWY3MzMtNTBiOC00MzA5LWJkMzMtMTlhNmUwNjQyODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1447142/","name":"Stephen Schneider","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2584298/","name":"Kelen Coleman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5059328/","name":"Jakob Wedel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3438843/","name":"Scott Dow"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3528615/","name":"Dev Wadhwa"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story. I for the most part was disappointed, it could have been so much better, all the had to do was pay attention to the source material, and not just scan over it. Also the re-writing of many of the characters is inconceivable to me, no idea why they would do it. \n\nMeh... I didn't like it very much.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-20","keywords":"dystopia,book burning,flamethrower,emoji,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young girl...and begins to rebel against society."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story. I for the most part was disappointed, it could have been so much better, all the had to do was pay attention to the source material, and not just scan over it. Also the re-writing of many of the characters is inconceivable to me, no idea why they would do it. \n\nMeh... I didn't like it very much.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-20","keywords":"dystopia,book burning,flamethrower,emoji,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young girl...and begins to rebel against society.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

Now not saying that this movie does not have flaws, because IT DOES. But it surprised me with its thematic elements, and really suspenseful scenes. But the cons are that it is a really heavy PG-13 film, and I personally thought they could have made it 10 times better if they had crossed the line into 'R'(which wouldn't have taken much more) and really fleshed out some things that are just hinted at because of their content. And the main con to the film for me was that there was no message at the end of the movie. It just ended, no theme or statement about the story.

In short, this is a lovely, well-written, beautifully cast film that's executed with great affection and makes maximum use of its chocolate-box locations.\n\nEmma Thompson, aside from having no little talent for scriptwriting, is savvy enough to understand that the real stars of this film are the children and, in particular, Asa Butterfield and Eros Vlahos as Norman and Cyril respectively.\n\nRhys Ifans shows what an accomplished comic actor he is, even if his performance as Uncle Phil seems to draw much, both in characterisation and delivery, from that of Matt Dillon's portrayal of Healy in There's Something About Mary.\n\nThere's a lovely turn from Maggie Smith as Mrs Docherty and a reassuringly exuberant performance from Sam Kelly.\n\nIf there's a lull, it's when the action moves away from its countryside setting, although the scene played between Vlahos and Ralph Feinnes works nicely.\n\nAt a little under an hour and fifty minutes, it's quite long for children, yet my five- and eight-year-olds sat transfixed throughout. And in the end, that should be the yardstick by which any film aimed at younger cinema-goers should be measured.\n\nAs to Thompson herself, she is sublime when required, understated when the surrounding action demands. The reviewer who likened her performance to that of Roger Moore does not, I would suggest, appreciate either the characterisation of the Nanny McPhee role (much can be, and is, portrayed by simple facial expressions) or the very real acting ability of our erstwhile Bond. Comedy isn't all about snappy one-liners and the ability to convey comedy simply by saying nothing is an art in and of itself.\n\nIn the final analysis, this is a better film than its predecessor. It is more lovingly-crafted, less fantastic in the literal sense and more sharply observed. Watch it for what it is - a modern take on the old Mary Poppins story - and you won't be disappointed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2010-06-02","keywords":"nanny,magic,farm,goat,elephant","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nanny McPhee Returns: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi823789337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUyNjIwOTEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwMTU0Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUyNjIwOTEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwMTU0Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Nanny McPhee arrives to help a harried young mother who is trying to run the family farm while her husband is away at war, though she uses her magic to teach the woman's children and their two spoiled cousins five new lessons.

From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.\n\nCal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.\n\nThe intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.\n\nAfter moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.\n\nThe polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood - these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that's just the stuff I can tell you! Cal's first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual, Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton, but it's interesting to note (in real life) she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).\n\nAll of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey). Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that, it's on to the new Spider-Man for her.\n\nGlenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman, who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.\n\nNo question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men will relate to what's going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":495148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-29","keywords":"divorce,marriage,unfaithfulness,adultery,marital problem","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3722091801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Newly single Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is taken on as wingman and protÃ©gÃ© to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).

Jamie Foxx is Max, a Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of his own limo company, "Island Limo". After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.\n\nHis worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Max hasn't even begun to revel in the pleasure of possessing the beautiful attorney's digits when he gets his next passenger, Tom Cruise as Vincent, a slick hit-man in town for a night of killing.\n\nWhen a body drops out of a fourth story window and onto Max's cab, he becomes an unwilling partner on Vincent's murder spree. Director Michael Mann (The Insider, Ali) does a masterful job manipulating texture and tone throughout the movie, taking us to settings as diverse as a junkie's apartment, a penthouse, a hospital room, and a smoky jazz club, all the while making the city of angels a central character in the story.\n\nThe soundtrack is also excellent, with a mixture of popular music and ambient tracks perfectly-timed and synced to the story... tribal drumbeats during the chase scenes, haunting rock ballads at pivotal moments, and one track that reminded this viewer of the scene at the other end of Tom Cruise's career, when he drives his father's Porsche out of the garage in "Risky Business" to the accompaniment of a thumping synth track. A bizarre side-note, I know.\n\nAs the movie builds to a climax, the police are hunting for Max, believing he is the one on a killing spree, and Vincent stalks his final victim in a blacked-out high-rise office to a backdrop of the brilliant LA skyline, reflected in multiplicity by the office's dozens of glass cubicles.\n\nTom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith all rise to the occasion in Collateral, and together they transcend their previous appearances on film. Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.\n\nThere are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.\n\nTroy Dayton","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":381969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"los angeles california,taxi driver,taxi,contract killer,driving at night","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Collateral","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi448725273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.\n\nThere are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.\n\nTroy Dayton","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":381969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"los angeles california,taxi driver,taxi,contract killer,driving at night","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Collateral","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi448725273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I love the deadpan delivery of funny lines: "I just bit into a pepper," a man says, when caught tearing up. I love the payoff when scams reach their climax.\n\nBut I wanted this movie to thrill me as the previous "Ocean" movies have, and, while it was a slick good time, it wasn't memorable.\n\nThere is less character development here than in previous movies. Ocean is not pursuing Tess. Linus has pretty much proved himself.\n\nThere wasn't the spectacular stunts as performed by Shaobo Qin in "Ocean's 11" or Vincent Cassel in "Ocean's 12." "Ocean's 13" doesn't fully exploit Las Vegas -- we've seen this movie's Las Vegas before.\n\nAl Pacino is kind of blah as the villain. I wasn't afraid of him; I just kept wondering why he had orange hair. Andy Garcia is more juicy in a smaller, ambivalent role.\n\nThe movie resuscitates the film career of Ellen Barkin. She looks spectacular: flat stomach, legs to die for, magnificent cleavage. And then what do they do? Humiliate her and make a bitter comment about how she is a woman "of a certain age." "Oceans 13" would have been a better movie if it had made better use of this hot actress.

At the time the show really captured a certain nineties sensibility - it was cynical, tongue-in-cheek, adult. Though not your average SATC fan - heterosexual, thirty-something male working in IT - I became obsessed, and was sure to see each new episode the first time it aired. However, over time I became disillusioned with the series.\n\nFirst, I eventually read the book. Despite the author's reluctance to say anything, the show never was much like the book, and has - over the years - strayed far far away. The book is, like most of Candace Bushnell's work, insightful and witty, with its humor derived from a certain urbane severity; it shares more with the works of Carrie Fischer and Tama Janowitz than any of the stuff now labeled Chick Lit.\n\nBushnell's characters may fall in love, even marry. They may have Manolos and Birkin bags, but this is all background noise of sorts. Bushnell is an under-rated pop-anthropologist, depicting the tribes that inhabit the big city. We may no longer be hunting our food, or struggling to keep the fire going, but it is still all about survival. Bushnell is great at depicting the primal hunger that, while it once made man fight to the death over territory or a fresh kill, now makes women deck themselves out in top gear and hunt down that Banker or Fortune 500 Executive, or fight tooth-and-nail to break through the glass ceiling.\n\nSecond, somewhere midlife, SATC, the show, got lost. All that incidental stuff - the shoes and bags, and places-to-be-seen - moved from the background to the foreground. The show became one long glossy luxury goods advertisement, the kind found in Vanity Fair. The movie underlines this - while there are great story lines, etc, the theatrical release is one obscene orgy of consumerism and decadence.\n\nToo bad. The last years of SATC is an insult to both the book and the early years of the show. It is certainly an insult to the public, but - considering SATC was most popular in its later years - maybe the insult is much deserved.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114914,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"friendship between women,friendship,love life,casual sex,new york city","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Percy Vs Goliath") is a biographical drama film based on the life of Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser. Directed by Clark Johnson ("S. W. A. T.", "The Sentinel") and starring Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci, and Zach Braff, it is a relatively routine true story picture that benefits primarily from its main star holding things together.\n\nIn 1998, in the Canadian town of Bruno, Saskatchewan, elderly farmer Percy Schmeiser (Christopher Walken) one day discovers he is being sued by the Monsanto corporation for allegedly using their enhanced GMO seeds for several years. Due to his family's limited funds, Percy cannot afford to take them on by himself and so enlists the help of young hotshot lawyer Jackson Weaver (Zach Braff) and environmental activist Rebecca Salcau (Christina Ricci) to fight a legal battle to ensure the safety of crops belonging to farmers everywhere. Because of the constant media exposure, Percy and his team gain many supporters from all over the world who motivate them to keep going in their pursuit of justice over the domineering corporate businesses.\n\nSince moving to a more rural neighbourhood many years ago, I have come to appreciate how hard farmers work to provide consumers with the best quality product they are capable of growing. Naturally, there will be various things that prove problematic along the way, such as the pressure to use GMOs or unsafe pesticides in their fruits and vegetables. In the film "Percy", we see that these factors are more serious than we may have originally thought, causing us to question the legality of corporate interference in selling harvested crops to unknowing customers. Although the film initially presents this as a locally Canadian issue, it is later established that there are corporations in other countries guilty of doing this as well. One scene in particular shows that farmers in India are suffering at the hands of big businesses bullying them into submission, which has contributed to high suicide rates among workers in that profession. It made me wonder how badly farmers have it in my own area as more than twenty years later, the issue of GMOs and pesticides are still a prevalent issue today.\n\nThere's little to say in terms of the directorial style here. Clark Johnson keeps things going at a simplistic level, intercutting between moments of Percy and co discussing legal matters with generic shots of the Saskatchewan farmland. Granted, it would be rather difficult to make subject matter like GMO seeds interesting to most audiences but for the most part he succeeds, showing that the future of a farmer's livelihood is at stake here. While I am aware this film is based on true events, I still wish it was less pedestrian in its approach to the source material. Everything felt as though it was following a typical template set by much better biographical dramas before it. As a result, I often found myself drifting in and out of my investment in the story, as I could tell right away how things were going to end due to the predictable direction that it was heading. Despite that, I was at least still curious to see how other farmers would react to the final court ruling of what Percy and his group ended up with.\n\nIt's easy to take for granted an actor like Christopher Walken, due to how prolific he is and the large amount of bizarre performances he's given in the past. Here, however, Walken demonstrates a dramatic range we often forget he's capable of, bringing a relatable sincerity to the role of Percy Schmeiser, a humble Canadian farmer who only wants what's best for the produce he grows (in this case, canola), bringing a necessary emotional centre to the film. I'm not sure how accurate his accent was, as American and Canadian accents sound almost identical to me, but I did feel he did a decent enough job convincing me that he was from North of the border. It was also nice to see Christina Ricci in a supporting role, as I consider her to be highly underrated. Ricci is one of those actresses whom I've never seen give a bad performance in anything she's in, and this film is no exception. I liked how her character remained a loyal ally to Percy, even accompanying him on international ventures to promote his cause. Zach Braff, on the other hand, wasn't featured as often as he should have been. This is a shame as I enjoyed seeing his character standing up for Percy and farmers everywhere based on his own moral principles rather than for monetary reasons. He is only prominently seen during the first and final acts of the film, which leads me to believe he was likely written in as a mere afterthought.\n\nWhile the film is nothing groundbreaking, it's still a decent enough drama to hold one's attention for its short duration of 99 minutes. It proudly wears its anti-capitalist morals on its sleeve so anyone who likes movies that try to "stick it to the man" should derive enough entertainment from something like this. As for me, I liked the acting the most, mainly from Walken and Ricci, so I hope those two will work together on something else in the future.\n\nI rate it 6.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1537,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","keywords":"farmer,organic farmer,cross contamination,lawsuit,courtroom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Percy Vs Goliath Official US Trailer (2021)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi260423705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000686/","name":"Christopher Walken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561809/","name":"Roberta Maxwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424800/","name":"Clark Johnson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0705676/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0141447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2125366/","name":"Garfield Lindsay Miller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0429499/","name":"Hilary Pryor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1285700/","name":"Maureen Dorey"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Believe it or not, it works. Ben Kingsley plays Frank, an enforcer for the Buffalo Polish Mafia who blows a major hit because he falls into an alcoholic stupor, and his bosses send him to San Francisco to join A.A. and get clean and sober.

I walked out impressed and touched, surprised by how much I really enjoyed it, and wondering if other people would give it a chance and enjoy it, as well. Time will tell.\n\nThe things that I liked about this movie are easy to feel but not so easy to describe. There were moments that really got to me, bits of scenes that touched me and caught in my memory, and time and again I found myself nodding and smiling and thinking, "I know exactly how he feels," or "I remember that feeling." Somehow, this story was good in a different way than Garden State was good. I loved Garden State, and the plot of Elizabethtown is enough like Garden State that it was hard not to have it in mind when I sat down in the theatre, but the two movies are really quite different. Crowe's Elizabethtown felt more real than Braf's Garden State, and somewhat less contrived.\n\nElizabethtown is the kind of movie you should see on a sunny autumn afternoon after a walk with an old friend. It has a joy to it, a basic sense of optimism and a light touch, so that it never crossed the line from sadness into tragedy and melodrama. Crowe doesn't let us fall into sentiment, but he deftly weaves a story that could have been corny and sentimental in lesser hands. I read critics who said he let the music play the emotions for us, but I can't agree, because I think that the cast did an excellent job portraying people I could really feel for and with, especially Orlando Bloom.\n\nOrlando Bloom's Drew Baylor is introduced in a moment of pain and panic, utterly emotionally blocked, repeating "I'm fine" while feeling suicidal and saying "My condolences" to strangers and distant relatives as if the loss of his father belongs to them and not to him. In the film, he relaxes and grows emotionally under the tutelage of Kirsten Dunst's Claire, and together they work their way through the American heartland into a tender relationship and a new perspective on the meaning and value of life and success. His American accent and her Southern drawl might both be a little off at times, but it was easy to forgive in the interest of watching what happened next.\n\nFrom the side stories of the secondary characters (Susan Sarandon is delightful, as always, in a turn as a widow whose reaction to her husband's death is to reach out and grab life with both hands) to the road trip into Americana, all the quirky little moments that felt real and sincere made this movie one that I enjoyed watching and will think about and remember.

The acting is terrible and the script has a lot of plot holes, it just makes no sense. The camera work and quality is overall nice, thats why it gets 2/10, but the movie is just boring, cringy and was not worth the money at the cinema. The story is very predictable and nothing new, they try to establish some kind of "youth speech" that doesnt exist and just makes it more cringe.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":205,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-07-02","keywords":"boy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3530866457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmYjYwNDEtMDg5Yi00MmJjLWFjMzktMTIwOGEyMTU5ZTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmYjYwNDEtMDg5Yi00MmJjLWFjMzktMTIwOGEyMTU5ZTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0374481/","name":"Jürgen Heinrich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2352896/","name":"Lisa-Marie Koroll","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7321970/","name":"Heiko Lochmann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3323470/","name":"Florian Ross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305258/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0375257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314266/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7191987/","name":"Tim Gondi"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Very underrated film that deserved to be bigger.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58658,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Musical"],"datePublished":"2016-06-03","keywords":"pop star,scene during end credits,repetition in title,concert,mockumentary","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2277946393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzA4MTIzNzReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU1Mzc0OTgx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzA4MTIzNzReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU1Mzc0OTgx._V1_.jpg","description":"When his new album fails to sell records, pop/rap superstar conner4real goes into a major tailspin and watches his celebrity high life begin to collapse.

At the time the show really captured a certain nineties sensibility - it was cynical, tongue-in-cheek, adult. Though not your average SATC fan - heterosexual, thirty-something male working in IT - I became obsessed, and was sure to see each new episode the first time it aired. However, over time I became disillusioned with the series.\n\nFirst, I eventually read the book. Despite the author's reluctance to say anything, the show never was much like the book, and has - over the years - strayed far far away. The book is, like most of Candace Bushnell's work, insightful and witty, with its humor derived from a certain urbane severity; it shares more with the works of Carrie Fischer and Tama Janowitz than any of the stuff now labeled Chick Lit.\n\nBushnell's characters may fall in love, even marry. They may have Manolos and Birkin bags, but this is all background noise of sorts. Bushnell is an under-rated pop-anthropologist, depicting the tribes that inhabit the big city. We may no longer be hunting our food, or struggling to keep the fire going, but it is still all about survival. Bushnell is great at depicting the primal hunger that, while it once made man fight to the death over territory or a fresh kill, now makes women deck themselves out in top gear and hunt down that Banker or Fortune 500 Executive, or fight tooth-and-nail to break through the glass ceiling.\n\nSecond, somewhere midlife, SATC, the show, got lost. All that incidental stuff - the shoes and bags, and places-to-be-seen - moved from the background to the foreground. The show became one long glossy luxury goods advertisement, the kind found in Vanity Fair.

The Ninth Gate is supposed to be a thriller or horror movie but it is neither. The Ninth Gate is an occult movie and that is a whole different ballpark.\n\nspoilers ahead!\n\n'You have before you the mystery of which men have dreamed throughout the centuries. Thousands have died an agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what you're about to see!' Those words are spoken by Boris Balkan, moments before he sets himself on fire in an attempt to raise the devil. The Ninth Gate is not only a movie about occultism, it is an occult movie by itself. First there is of course the obvious story that most people find quite disappointing BUT under the surface there is the real story that is only understood by those who are fairly familiar with symbolism and occultism. \n\nAlthough The Ninth gate is based on just a part of the book El Club Dumas, it is nevertheless a clever story of its own. \n\nThe movie is about a riddle that is supposed to be hidden in three books, in the end that riddle is solved by Dean Corso. The movie itself contains a riddle and that riddle is to be solved by us. Besides the engravings, lots of symbolism and hints will help us understand the meaning of several strange events and eventually the meaning of what the story is all about and what happened to Balkan and Corso. The plot is created around a joke, a joke that is based on a misunderstanding. This makes a movie that one needs to see more than once, I bought the DVD and saw it over twenty times. The story gets better every time you watch it, pay attention to even the smallest details like the color of the mysterious girl's socks, there is a good reason why Corso has a shoulder bag and an overcoat he never seems to part from, until the 'notorious' very last scene; shoulder bag and overcoat are gone... Aren't you curious about the meaning of broken glasses in combination of a mark between the eyes? Search the internet for the answers to the questions you have. It's fun if you like to solve riddles, I had a great time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-08-25","keywords":"rare book,book detective,bibliophilia,satanic,unholy book","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Ninth Gate","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2649817369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU3MDEwNzgtMjU1NC00OTY0LTg2NzMtMzY5ZTNjMWRjNjc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU3MDEwNzgtMjU1NC00OTY0LTg2NzMtMzY5ZTNjMWRjNjc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001449/","name":"Frank Langella"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000565/","name":"Lena Olin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027161/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702416/","name":"Arturo Pérez-Reverte"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115224/","name":"John Brownjohn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881762/","name":"Enrique Urbizu"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Ninth Gate is supposed to be a thriller or horror movie but it is neither. The Ninth Gate is an occult movie and that is a whole different ballpark.\n\nspoilers ahead!\n\n'You have before you the mystery of which men have dreamed throughout the centuries. Thousands have died an agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what you're about to see!' Those words are spoken by Boris Balkan, moments before he sets himself on fire in an attempt to raise the devil. The Ninth Gate is not only a movie about occultism, it is an occult movie by itself. First there is of course the obvious story that most people find quite disappointing BUT under the surface there is the real story that is only understood by those who are fairly familiar with symbolism and occultism. \n\nAlthough The Ninth gate is based on just a part of the book El Club Dumas, it is nevertheless a clever story of its own. \n\nThe movie is about a riddle that is supposed to be hidden in three books, in the end that riddle is solved by Dean Corso. The movie itself contains a riddle and that riddle is to be solved by us. Besides the engravings, lots of symbolism and hints will help us understand the meaning of several strange events and eventually the meaning of what the story is all about and what happened to Balkan and Corso. The plot is created around a joke, a joke that is based on a misunderstanding. This makes a movie that one needs to see more than once, I bought the DVD and saw it over twenty times. The story gets better every time you watch it, pay attention to even the smallest details like the color of the mysterious girl's socks, there is a good reason why Corso has a shoulder bag and an overcoat he never seems to part from, until the 'notorious' very last scene; shoulder bag and overcoat are gone... Aren't you curious about the meaning of broken glasses in combination of a mark between the eyes? Search the internet for the answers to the questions you have. It's fun if you like to solve riddles, I had a great time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-08-25","keywords":"rare book,book detective,bibliophilia,satanic,unholy book","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Ninth Gate","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2649817369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU3MDEwNzgtMjU1NC00OTY0LTg2NzMtMzY5ZTNjMWRjNjc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU3MDEwNzgtMjU1NC00OTY0LTg2NzMtMzY5ZTNjMWRjNjc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001449/","name":"Frank Langella","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000565/","name":"Lena Olin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027161/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702416/","name":"Arturo Pérez-Reverte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115224/","name":"John Brownjohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881762/","name":"Enrique Urbizu"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The truth is you have Brad on the one hand who's cool and even fairly talented. Yet on the other hand there's Julia Roberts, lacking much talent and losing her appeal on the big screen at an accelerating rate. Well it seems to me the director has taken this into account and has left Julia out of most of the movie, and thankfully spared us slotting the two together in too many scenes.\n\nWith movies about Mexico the flavour of the month this movie does little to inspire you, and gives even less of an insight into Mexicans and their way of life.

The truth is you have Brad on the one hand who's cool and even fairly talented. Yet on the other hand there's Julia Roberts, lacking much talent and losing her appeal on the big screen at an accelerating rate. Well it seems to me the director has taken this into account and has left Julia out of most of the movie, and thankfully spared us slotting the two together in too many scenes.\n\nWith movies about Mexico the flavour of the month this movie does little to inspire you, and gives even less of an insight into Mexicans and their way of life. Big Brad will entertain the ladies though, and with a few blank expressions and appropriate comments, most of the audience seemed to go home happy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2001-05-09","keywords":"hostage,revenge,thief,murder,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Mexican","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4059037977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOThiYjItZWJhMC00OTg0LWFlNzItZTRkOTFjOWRhODVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOThiYjItZWJhMC00OTg0LWFlNzItZTRkOTFjOWRhODVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001254/","name":"James Gandolfini"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893659/","name":"Gore Verbinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082027/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093776/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0437249/","name":"J.H.

That said, the movie did improve. Rebecca Dalton (playing Allie) had a decent performance. The scenes with her and the children were the strongest scenes of the film. She did a good job here, giving off a warm and fun vibe to her performance. Aaron Ashmore (playing Gordon) was not bad. I prefer him in Killjoys (he is great in that series) to this. He had some awkward acting at times, especially early on and towards the end of the movie, I thought. The chemistry between the two was not great. However, his scenes (towards the middle) with Allie and the children were warm and fun. He had a good performance in those scenes. The supporting cast was pretty good. Chris Sandiford (playing Tony) had a kind and gentle vibe to his performance, which I liked. The two children, Molly Lewis as Iris and Hattie Kragten as Rose, both had cute performances. Again, for me, it was the scenes with them and Allie or them with Allie and Gordon that were the strongest. The scenery, props, and sets were fine, though I was not a fan of that house. Did anyone notice that the two large snowmen were made of cotton balls? You could see the fibers sticking out. It was strange as the two smaller ones were clearly made of snow.

But I did expect it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And it was.\n\nOne of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers. The chemistry between the actors was excellent and really added to the feel of the film. It takes a lot to get emotion out of me in a movie, I'm talking the beginning of Saving Private Ryan a lot, so I unfortunately didn't feel as much as some of the other people in the theater, but you know something is right when people cheer when the main characters kill bad guys and yell "NO!" when things don't go right. The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.\n\nSingleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I've ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.\n\nActing was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.\n\nWhile this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":141064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-16","keywords":"corrupt police,death of brother,death of mother,murder,funeral","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Four Brothers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135083801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0071275/","name":"André 3000"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005436/","name":"John Singleton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332238/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254213/","name":"David Elliot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1749087/","name":"Paul Lovett"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.\n\nWhile this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":141064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-16","keywords":"corrupt police,death of brother,death of mother,murder,funeral","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Four Brothers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135083801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0071275/","name":"André 3000"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005436/","name":"John Singleton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332238/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254213/","name":"David Elliot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1749087/","name":"Paul Lovett"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-24","keywords":"archeologist,based on video game,sequel,altered version of studio logo,eight word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Two: The Cradle of Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi143786265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057368/","name":"Chris Barrie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212988/","name":"Dean Georgaris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-24","keywords":"archeologist,based on video game,sequel,altered version of studio logo,eight word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Two: The Cradle of Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi143786265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057368/","name":"Chris Barrie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212988/","name":"Dean Georgaris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

First; it is made by a company called Asylum and second; don't get excited by the pamphlet which is showing people hanging out on a chopper. \n\nAs with all the other movies made by Asylum, you have to understand this is a B grade movie. I don't even know if this kind of movies will see the day they deserve in the cinemas. For a company who has made hundreds of movies, I am really surprise that they have never graduated from the B grade or just quit the business of making movie. Surely they must understand that making a crappy movie will mean loosing money. \n\nThere is no logic in this movie, there is no plot and I don't even know what the story is about, except it is about the famous San Andreas Fault. Most of us have seen the picture of devastation in 1906 during the California's earth quake caused by similar San Andreas fault. The whole city was destroyed. But not in the case with this movie. Of course there are some CGI scenes with the collapsed building, broken road, damaged bridges and fires (although I have no idea, why there is always fire) and to complete the danger, a high voltage cable which is floating around to kill people. \n\nIt is always a disgraced brilliant scientist which no one believe who developed the method of finding the most important information to support the story. Since nobody believe her, our hero has to go half across the state of California to save her family. I am not sure who give the background information on the technology, but when your cellphone does not work, logically the wireless equipment also not working ? Right ? Wrong...., because in this movie, your cellphone quit working but your other wireless equipment will also quit working, but not in this case; the wireless equipment that is showing the earth-quake keeps on having the internet connection and feeding the data as well even after the big quake happens. \n\nOf all the things that defy the logic, I would not think that in the earth-quake situation, you will try to go through the underground tunnel to reach a place. I would have thought underground tunnel is one of the most dangerous place to be, but not in this movie. All in all, I know this is a movie and you expect exaggeration on the story, but Asylum is really making this movie with the assumption that most (if not all) the viewers are stupid idiot. \n\nI wonder, whether in real life this kind of movies really has any fans. To copy-cat the movie is okay, but do it with more effort, not just with the attitude of neither here nor there.....","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-05-19","keywords":"helicopter crash,disaster film,african american,building collapse,cell phone","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1922619/","name":"Jhey Castles"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4434428/","name":"Jason Woods"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1836948/","name":"Grace Van Dien"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0062357/","name":"John Baumgartner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0369873/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0062357/","name":"John Baumgartner"}],"duration":"PT1H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First; it is made by a company called Asylum and second; don't get excited by the pamphlet which is showing people hanging out on a chopper. \n\nAs with all the other movies made by Asylum, you have to understand this is a B grade movie. I don't even know if this kind of movies will see the day they deserve in the cinemas. For a company who has made hundreds of movies, I am really surprise that they have never graduated from the B grade or just quit the business of making movie. Surely they must understand that making a crappy movie will mean loosing money. \n\nThere is no logic in this movie, there is no plot and I don't even know what the story is about, except it is about the famous San Andreas Fault. Most of us have seen the picture of devastation in 1906 during the California's earth quake caused by similar San Andreas fault. The whole city was destroyed. But not in the case with this movie. Of course there are some CGI scenes with the collapsed building, broken road, damaged bridges and fires (although I have no idea, why there is always fire) and to complete the danger, a high voltage cable which is floating around to kill people. \n\nIt is always a disgraced brilliant scientist which no one believe who developed the method of finding the most important information to support the story. Since nobody believe her, our hero has to go half across the state of California to save her family. I am not sure who give the background information on the technology, but when your cellphone does not work, logically the wireless equipment also not working ? Right ? Wrong...., because in this movie, your cellphone quit working but your other wireless equipment will also quit working, but not in this case; the wireless equipment that is showing the earth-quake keeps on having the internet connection and feeding the data as well even after the big quake happens. \n\nOf all the things that defy the logic, I would not think that in the earth-quake situation, you will try to go through the underground tunnel to reach a place. I would have thought underground tunnel is one of the most dangerous place to be, but not in this movie. All in all, I know this is a movie and you expect exaggeration on the story, but Asylum is really making this movie with the assumption that most (if not all) the viewers are stupid idiot. \n\nI wonder, whether in real life this kind of movies really has any fans. To copy-cat the movie is okay, but do it with more effort, not just with the attitude of neither here nor there.....","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-05-19","keywords":"helicopter crash,disaster film,african american,building collapse,cell phone","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1922619/","name":"Jhey Castles","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4434428/","name":"Jason Woods","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1836948/","name":"Grace Van Dien"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0062357/","name":"John Baumgartner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0369873/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0062357/","name":"John Baumgartner"],"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Prequels to films are often made when there is either a rich back story behind the originals or the producers are wanting a little more money from a particular franchise (see the Star Wars prequels). The problem they present is that film- makers have to construct their work, with the knowledge that the audience knows how it ends. One of the greatest things about seeing a film for the first time is the surprise and anticipation, to removing that can detract a lot from the overall impact of the film. But this summer I have had the pleasure of seeing X-men First Class, and now Rise of the Planet of the Apes - two excellent prequels to series that I didn't care for previously.\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA from now on, I can't bear typing it) is not only a triumph in CG animation, but as a stellar science fiction film, that remembers that films are infinitely more engaging when the audience actually cares for the characters on screen. Too often do I see films with a high premise that forget to flesh out their characters, leaving us to run around in mindless, weightless explosions with nobodies who we know less than 3 things about (cough, Transformers 3). Yes, RPA is about super intelligent apes that ransack cities and take on armed forces with little more than what surrounds them, but before we get to that there is an enormous amount of development from the main protagonist; Caesar. Although the advertisement trumpets James Franco, John Lithgow etc, the real star here is Andy Serkis, along with millions of dollars worth of CG animation to create the most expressive animated creatures on film. Even with Avatar, using real humans, pales in comparison to the amount of detail going into every single one of these apes; there is not one second in the film where you cannot understand one of the primates intentions - you could practically vocalise them yourself with the refined eye movement, body language that clearly separates Caesar from his more primitive relatives. Needless to say, Caesar's performance is flawless; after all this is the man who brought Gollum to life, but he captures the screen with an entirely wordless performance, which to me is the greatest part of the film. I felt for Caesar more than any other character in this film, and he did it without saying a word. Eat that Michael Bay. I was almost in tears at one point during one of Caesar's more emotional scenes for Christ Sake - although a chimp, the heightened intelligence really gives him just enough human characteristic to be above the uncanny valley while still behaving like an animal.\n\nThe humans in the film were what I considered weakest in this film; not any of the performances were bad, but a little more development in some minor characters and some tweak in the writing here and there would have made this a perfect 10. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) felt a bit off to me; he was cruel but almost in a cartoon way, though I suspect that's more to do with ill writing than any personal issues. The main cast are good, though at it's current length, I think more development with James Franco's character wouldn't have gone amiss, but then again, this might have thrown off the pacing.\n\nAnother thing I love about this film is that while taking a sharp diversion from its roots in terms of gradual characterisation, it does a superb job of delivering what everyone inevitably came for. A massive Chimpocalypse. A simian uprising that sees the downtrodden apes taking up arms against humanity, and in three words: it's f - ing cool. Made all the more exciting by the anticipation and the feel for these characters, the marvellous point about Caesar's character is that we sympathise with him, we understand why he leads an ape army AND WE SUPPORT HIM. A super intelligent ape is rallying a chimp attack force to free themselves from their confines, cause mayhem, disrupt order and ultimately rule humanity AND WE WANT THEM TO. And for that I applaud.\n\nI love a film that makes us look inwards at ourselves and question our own moral codes and attitudes to events in life (this one clearly representing a case of animal cruelty) that make us conclude that WE are indeed the bad guys, and we need to change. Living in a small, rural middle-class society (like myself) or a well-developed area often makes mainstream audiences forget about those less fortunate than themselves, and what it drives them to, or in this case, what having too much drives us to, and it's refreshing to see something that reminds us of how much of a plague we are to the rest of the planet.\n\nOverall, I would say a strong 9/10, perhaps not quite reaching the highs that First Class did, but by God, was it more consistent - definitely watch this one, and stay after the credits.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":511037,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
