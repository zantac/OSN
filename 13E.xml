    <desc lang="pl">W Polsce trwa spór pomiędzy dwoma ugrupowaniami - narodowcami i ich przeciwnikami. Grzegorz Paprzycki dokumentuje przebieg tych potyczek. Pojawia się w samym środku wydarzeń, podczas których niejednokrotnie dochodzi do aktów przemocy. Film stanowi subiektywne spojrzenie na konflikt, który toczy się na polskich ulicach. Za swój obraz reżyser otrzymał Złotego Lajkonika na Krakowskim Festiwalu Filmowym.</desc>

This was probably filmed in Mojave.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1740,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-09-22","keywords":"florence arizona,arizona,arizona desert,arizona state prison,quartzsite arizona","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424893209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDJhZjFjNWMtOGE1Ni00NDM4LWI5NmUtY2NmODk0ZjVhNWMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDJhZjFjNWMtOGE1Ni00NDM4LWI5NmUtY2NmODk0ZjVhNWMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the summer of 1978 convicted murderer Gary Tison (Robert Patrick) and his cellmate Randy Greenawalt (Chris Browning) staged a daring escape from an Arizona State Prison, with the help of Tison's three teenage sons. Their murderous rampage through the southwestern desert shocked the nation with its brutality. While Sheriff Cooper (Bruce Davison) hunted them down, Tison's wife (Heather Graham) vehemently defended her family in the press.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001598/","name":"Robert Patrick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001287/","name":"Heather Graham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001117/","name":"Bruce Davison"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0514546/","name":"Dwight H.

This was probably filmed in Mojave.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1740,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-09-22","keywords":"florence arizona,arizona,arizona desert,arizona state prison,quartzsite arizona","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424893209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDJhZjFjNWMtOGE1Ni00NDM4LWI5NmUtY2NmODk0ZjVhNWMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDJhZjFjNWMtOGE1Ni00NDM4LWI5NmUtY2NmODk0ZjVhNWMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the summer of 1978 convicted murderer Gary Tison (Robert Patrick) and his cellmate Randy Greenawalt (Chris Browning) staged a daring escape from an Arizona State Prison, with the help of Tison's three teenage sons. Their murderous rampage through the southwestern desert shocked the nation with its brutality. While Sheriff Cooper (Bruce Davison) hunted them down, Tison's wife (Heather Graham) vehemently defended her family in the press.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001598/","name":"Robert Patrick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001287/","name":"Heather Graham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001117/","name":"Bruce Davison"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0514546/","name":"Dwight H.

The two start living together and while it's not all roses, the commitment is truly there.\n\nAnd then cancer strikes and what to do about whatever estate Hester might leave. This story illustrates precisely the problem that LGBTQ people had before marriage settled the issue permanently. You could in some places get a domestic partnership certificate and have the relationship recorded. But it wasn't mandated that private industry and government recognize it.\n\nThus was the issue of the film as the town of Freehold and its governing body would not extend survivor benefits to Ms. Andree. They were not married, but legally they could not get married. At least without a lot of agitation and organizing.\n\nWhich is where Steve Carrell as Steven Goldstein comes in, leading the same sex marriage lobbying group. The issue as he says is so neatly encapsulated in the problem that Hester and Andree face.\n\nTwo things I liked about Freeheld that make this a special film. One was the chemistry between Julianne Moore and Ellen Page as Laurel and Stacy. They made me believe the love was real.\n\nThe second was the scenes among Laurel's police colleagues with her and among themselves. The differing reactions was a sampling of straight and male America, quite nicely documented.\n\nFreeheld is a great film showing the need for same sex marriage as few others have.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12366,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2016-02-10","keywords":"lesbian kiss,gay bar,partner,cancer,public hearing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3415913241","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMDM5NzA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTExMTUzNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMDM5NzA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTExMTUzNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A decorated New Jersey police detective, Laurel is diagnosed with cancer and wants to leave her hard earned pension to her domestic partner, Stacie.

I found the tone of the script particularly offensive, particularly in the depiction of multiple sclerosis. I write as somebody married to an MS sufferer, and I can report that the MS portrayed in this film is even more ridiculous than the stuff involving the killer bees. The character doesn't act like somebody with MS in the slightest, the symptoms as described are wrong, and to top it all they describe MS as a 'terminal illness'. It's sloppy writing, and had me fuming.\n\nStill, at least it enlivened what is otherwise an entirely forgettable movie. KILLER BEES! follows the same old hackneyed storyline with a single character (THE HITCHER'S C. Thomas Howell, looking old and tired) who recognises the impending threat while nobody else believes him. Inevitably, there's a big event coming up, and the greedy Mayor refuses to cancel it. What makes KILLER BEES! stand out is how poorly the action is staged, in addition to the terrible calibre of the special effects.\n\nThe PG rating is the final insult; if this had contained some proper gore effects a la PIRANHA 3D, I could have forgiven it for the rest of the problems. Instead, it plays it safe throughout, and the shots of bees are limited to just a few CGI clouds in the skies. It's nonsense and the cast of badly-acting townsfolk hardly serve to increase the entertainment value. In a world of bad films, KILLER BEES! is the worst bee B-movie yet.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-11-19","keywords":"psychotronic film,creature feature,bee,killer bee,bee attack","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001367/","name":"C.

I found the tone of the script particularly offensive, particularly in the depiction of multiple sclerosis. I write as somebody married to an MS sufferer, and I can report that the MS portrayed in this film is even more ridiculous than the stuff involving the killer bees. The character doesn't act like somebody with MS in the slightest, the symptoms as described are wrong, and to top it all they describe MS as a 'terminal illness'. It's sloppy writing, and had me fuming.\n\nStill, at least it enlivened what is otherwise an entirely forgettable movie. KILLER BEES! follows the same old hackneyed storyline with a single character (THE HITCHER'S C. Thomas Howell, looking old and tired) who recognises the impending threat while nobody else believes him. Inevitably, there's a big event coming up, and the greedy Mayor refuses to cancel it. What makes KILLER BEES! stand out is how poorly the action is staged, in addition to the terrible calibre of the special effects.\n\nThe PG rating is the final insult; if this had contained some proper gore effects a la PIRANHA 3D, I could have forgiven it for the rest of the problems. Instead, it plays it safe throughout, and the shots of bees are limited to just a few CGI clouds in the skies. It's nonsense and the cast of badly-acting townsfolk hardly serve to increase the entertainment value. In a world of bad films, KILLER BEES! is the worst bee B-movie yet.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-11-19","keywords":"psychotronic film,creature feature,bee,killer bee,bee attack","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001367/","name":"C.

A demonic force is summoned to take the soul of a young boy who could become a saint and if done it could open a doorway to hell. However this entity can only travel through shadows and needs to collect souls to complete this task. But on its trail is Father Vassey, who's heading to this sleepy rural town to find the boy first. The occult horror "Shadow Builder" is an adaptation of a Stocker story and the screenplay only seems to muddled it up with half-baked theories, as it leans towards its cheesy special effects, nasty shocks and poignant performances led by Michael Rooker's grizzled renegade priest who gets around with pistols than say a bible and Tony Todd as some loony giggling Jamaican hermit that kids are afraid of. Actually "Shadow Builder" isn't all that bad, but in parts it's fairly amusing and surprisingly dark in its atmospherics. The opening scenes are actually quite fun. Over-the-top and silly, but fun especially seeing Rooker at work in his choice of repenting sinners. The demonic entity has some striking facial details, but basically it's black CGI smoke and like most villainous horror characters has something cleverly smart to say.

A demonic force is summoned to take the soul of a young boy who could become a saint and if done it could open a doorway to hell. However this entity can only travel through shadows and needs to collect souls to complete this task. But on its trail is Father Vassey, who's heading to this sleepy rural town to find the boy first. The occult horror "Shadow Builder" is an adaptation of a Stocker story and the screenplay only seems to muddled it up with half-baked theories, as it leans towards its cheesy special effects, nasty shocks and poignant performances led by Michael Rooker's grizzled renegade priest who gets around with pistols than say a bible and Tony Todd as some loony giggling Jamaican hermit that kids are afraid of. Actually "Shadow Builder" isn't all that bad, but in parts it's fairly amusing and surprisingly dark in its atmospherics. The opening scenes are actually quite fun. Over-the-top and silly, but fun especially seeing Rooker at work in his choice of repenting sinners. The demonic entity has some striking facial details, but basically it's black CGI smoke and like most villainous horror characters has something cleverly smart to say. With this last point, I thought it would have been better suited if it said nothing at all. The direction is rather stylised for its low- budget, but the plot doesn't meander much and it has enough thrills in its formulaic patterns of good vs. evil  or light vs. darkness.

The story is an excellent mix of Sherlock Holmes-type crime thriller and religious criticism/commentary. I found this to be exceptional as the book was labeled as impossible to remake as a film and while the book is indeed better than the film, the film is certainly not without its charms.\n\nFirst of all the cast is pretty much perfect. Reading the book Sean Connery wasn't who I had in mind as the character but he certainly makes the character his own. His performance is for lack of a better word unique. He brings his usual indescribable something to the character which makes him almost instantly likable and believable. He delivers his lines in a confident manner that suits the character. Like in many other of his films his character is a teacher character but he does not seem to berate his pupil (Christian Slater) but allows him to grow on his own merely nudging him along. Even though not my first choice to have played the character I cannot find any other who would suit the part after seeing the film. Christian Slater plays the protagonist in what must be described as his break through character. His inexperience as an actor shows and once again suits the character who is also quite inexperienced in many ways. He portrays the change and ultimate conflicts of his character well enough and like Connery makes the character his own. Michael Lonsdale is pretty good as well and even though the character is not as well defined as in the book he provides the broad strokes in a satisfactory manner. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. does an excellent job in bringing Jorge to life and matches Connery's authority in their scenes together but once again the character is done in pretty broad strokes and you only get a small taste of what the character was like in the book. F. Murray Abraham's character is not like in the book and even though I was slightly disappointed by the film's portrayal of the character I understand why it was necessary to change the character for dramatic purposes. Ron Perlman who has since gone on to become quite a big star has a small role in this film and he does a decent job.\n\nThe film thrives on its complex story (which is nowhere near as complex as in the book) and deep characterization of the main characters who are about as defined as characters can become without internal monologue. There is voice-over by the older version of Christian Slater's character but is basically only used in the introduction and end part of the film and at a few crucial moments. The fantastic characterization is also helped by the incredibly sharp and well written dialog which never gets boring or forced like you could have feared given the religious content. In many scenes the dialog was in fact so good that I got the chills. The film focuses mainly on the mystery elements but the religious elements of the film are somehow weaved into the overall plot but there were plenty more of these religious elements and factors in the book. Overall I think the film should have been at least 15 minutes longer to get more of these elements in but maybe thats just me. However, all the most important plot points (and a few sub-plots) are covered so in that sense the film is successful.\n\nAnother thing that works very well is the atmosphere of the film which is very tense and mysterious. The tension is helped by the music which like so many other things in the film is quite unique and fitting. The set work is pretty simple but as it is a monastery you cannot expect the most flamboyant of sets. The sets work in their simplicity, however, and there is really no point of critique to be found in the set work. The lighting is kept at a minimum as well and once again this works in favor of the film as it adds to the overall tension. Sometimes the lighting is a little to dark but it happens so rarely that its not really a problem.\n\nAll in all Der Name der Rose (or The Name of the Rose) is a wonderful film but what drags the film down ever so slightly is that it can some times feel a little rushed because of the amount of material it is covering and there were a few elements from the book I would have liked to have seen in the film. In general, however, the cross from book to film is very well done and the overall plot is very well depicted with many tense, frightening and interesting moments. The film is definitely one of Connery's best and it is mainly because of his performance that I am giving the film a 9 in stead of an 8\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1986-10-17","keywords":"middle ages,abbey,monk,franciscan,14th century","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000225/","name":"Christian Slater"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702818/","name":"Helmut Qualtinger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013358/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0248767/","name":"Umberto Eco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001949/","name":"Andrew Birkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102722/","name":"Gérard Brach"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ron Perlman who has since gone on to become quite a big star has a small role in this film and he does a decent job.\n\nThe film thrives on its complex story (which is nowhere near as complex as in the book) and deep characterization of the main characters who are about as defined as characters can become without internal monologue. There is voice-over by the older version of Christian Slater's character but is basically only used in the introduction and end part of the film and at a few crucial moments. The fantastic characterization is also helped by the incredibly sharp and well written dialog which never gets boring or forced like you could have feared given the religious content. In many scenes the dialog was in fact so good that I got the chills. The film focuses mainly on the mystery elements but the religious elements of the film are somehow weaved into the overall plot but there were plenty more of these religious elements and factors in the book. Overall I think the film should have been at least 15 minutes longer to get more of these elements in but maybe thats just me. However, all the most important plot points (and a few sub-plots) are covered so in that sense the film is successful.\n\nAnother thing that works very well is the atmosphere of the film which is very tense and mysterious. The tension is helped by the music which like so many other things in the film is quite unique and fitting. The set work is pretty simple but as it is a monastery you cannot expect the most flamboyant of sets. The sets work in their simplicity, however, and there is really no point of critique to be found in the set work. The lighting is kept at a minimum as well and once again this works in favor of the film as it adds to the overall tension. Sometimes the lighting is a little to dark but it happens so rarely that its not really a problem.\n\nAll in all Der Name der Rose (or The Name of the Rose) is a wonderful film but what drags the film down ever so slightly is that it can some times feel a little rushed because of the amount of material it is covering and there were a few elements from the book I would have liked to have seen in the film. In general, however, the cross from book to film is very well done and the overall plot is very well depicted with many tense, frightening and interesting moments. The film is definitely one of Connery's best and it is mainly because of his performance that I am giving the film a 9 in stead of an 8\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1986-10-17","keywords":"middle ages,abbey,monk,franciscan,14th century","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000225/","name":"Christian Slater","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702818/","name":"Helmut Qualtinger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013358/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0248767/","name":"Umberto Eco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001949/","name":"Andrew Birkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102722/","name":"Gérard Brach"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Great stuff!\n\nTo its credit, the movie is self-aware (there is a hilarious cameo that I won't spoil for you) and it's not a "San Andreas" blockbuster-budget movie that takes itself seriously.\n\nConveniently, the movie is just 79 minutes long, but the last third changes from "so bad it's good" to just "bad" and finally to jumping the shark (or the spider).\n\nBelieve it or not, there is already a planned sequel.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-07-25","keywords":"giant spider,family man,tremor,shaker,shotgun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lavalantula","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4037653017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGJlMjMwOTYtMTJmMi00NjQ3LTk0ZmQtM2I5YmEzYTU4YzFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGJlMjMwOTYtMTJmMi00NjQ3LTk0ZmQtM2I5YmEzYTU4YzFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Lavalantula","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000430/","name":"Steve Guttenberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001604/","name":"Nia Peeples","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719606/","name":"Patrick Renna"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0579079/","name":"Mike Mendez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017447/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140089/","name":"Neil Elman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0579079/","name":"Mike Mendez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4639862/","name":"Ashley O'Neil"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The start of the movie show some action but 10 minutes later the story starts to slow down and to became into a fictional story that try to make you think that Phillipo is an Angel who born the same day and hour than Phillipa and that his destiny is to help (and also fall in love!) Phillipa to escape from the law because she killed 4 innocent people when she was trying to set a bomb to kill the drug dealer who supplied the drug to her exhusband who died for an overdoze (besides that she was unfaithful in her marriage)!!!!!!!! can you imagine what a stupid and inmoral screenplay?... Things get worse when Phillipo help to Blanchett role to kill the drug dealer!... (very nice Guardian Angel!)\n\nThe last part is even worst, the scene where they escape in a helicopter from the police and dissapear in "Heaven", what a symbolic end! lol.\n\nI enjoyed Lola Renn and the Color Trilogy, and i don't have anything bad to say about Blanchett or Ribisi, they have decent performs and the photography and locations are also good, but this story is not good at all!...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25335,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2002-02-21","keywords":"fantastical ending,love,death,bomb,police","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2250745369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT# 2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000610/","name":"Giovanni Ribisi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320969/","name":"Remo Girone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001425/","name":"Krzysztof Kieslowski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682830/","name":"Krzysztof Piesiewicz"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First when you watch the DVD cover you see two superb actors as Giovanni Ribisi and Cate Blanchett (Both also in The Gift, that is a Raimi's excellent thriller) and also watch that is from Tykwer (specifically says "From the same director as Lola Renn"), you'll think that you are just ahead to watch an excellent movie. The start of the movie show some action but 10 minutes later the story starts to slow down and to became into a fictional story that try to make you think that Phillipo is an Angel who born the same day and hour than Phillipa and that his destiny is to help (and also fall in love!) Phillipa to escape from the law because she killed 4 innocent people when she was trying to set a bomb to kill the drug dealer who supplied the drug to her exhusband who died for an overdoze (besides that she was unfaithful in her marriage)!!!!!!!! can you imagine what a stupid and inmoral screenplay?... Things get worse when Phillipo help to Blanchett role to kill the drug dealer!... (very nice Guardian Angel!)\n\nThe last part is even worst, the scene where they escape in a helicopter from the police and dissapear in "Heaven", what a symbolic end! lol.\n\nI enjoyed Lola Renn and the Color Trilogy, and i don't have anything bad to say about Blanchett or Ribisi, they have decent performs and the photography and locations are also good, but this story is not good at all!...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25335,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2002-02-21","keywords":"fantastical ending,love,death,bomb,police","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2250745369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGMwNmFjMWUtODRmYy00MTM3LTgyNjktMjJiYmI3MDZmNTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT# 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000610/","name":"Giovanni Ribisi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320969/","name":"Remo Girone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001425/","name":"Krzysztof Kieslowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682830/","name":"Krzysztof Piesiewicz"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a mark of Barker's screenwriting talent (so often evident in his other films if you can look beneath the shlock) that all the characters, even monsters seen only briefly, ring true in some strange way.  The many stories are actually touching.  Also, the ending is cleverly conceived; it doesnt go out of its way to leave the door open for a sequel, rather the open door is integral to the plot.  I would love to see a follow-up just to know how Barker carries through the mythical aspects he introduces in this film's last part.\n\nPerhaps the film could have been more focused, with fewer subsidiary characters; perhaps the completely inappropriate (but obviously intentional) humor could have been dropped; perhaps the entire serial-killer sub-plot could have been excised completely.

I want to give it a higher rating because at the end of each episode I've looked forward to the next one; However, the lack of logic and common sense (particularly in the earlier episodes) as well as continuity issues prevents me from doing so. The yo-yo effect of both main characters' commitment to the case, the unrealistic reactions by some of the characters in some instances and the confusing timeline references distract me from what would otherwise be a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience. I have the season 1 finale to watch yet and I believe the show has been picked up for a second season so I will look forward to that. I hope some of the flaws will be addressed for series 2 but, I also hope the overall look and feel won't be drastically altered. Some shows in the past have been tweaked into nonexistence by network brass and viewer opinions. This first season seemed to be generally headed in the right direction. "Burden of Truth" could have a long run if handled properly.\n\nAddendum: The way I rate shows... I don't usually review anything less than a 7 because 6 would be a failing grade and I won't waste my time watching it. I'm old; I don't know how much time I've got left. Since I probably turned it off before getting even halfway through, it wouldn't be fair to rate or review it. 7 is watchable but I may go a while between episodes since, though somewhat entertaining, there are other shows more interesting or compelling. 8 would be a regular in my lineup. 9 is a must see and probably bingeable. 10 is just the epitome of superbity and headed for my all-time favorites list. I'm adding this to my reviews because it seems there are a lot of binary reactions to pretty much everything these days. I am not a like/unlike kind of guy. I see a lot of grays so if I give something a 10 it doesn't mean the only alternative is a 1.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3867,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-10","keywords":"legal drama,attorney,court case,legal system,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0471036/","name":"Kristin Kreuk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312105/","name":"Peter Mooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2868495/","name":"Meegwun Fairbrother"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121071/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466443/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800920/","name":"Brad Simpson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Off the Field" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1975630617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NGViZWMtMzE0MS00MTI1LTg4YzAtNjdmYzcxMzFjYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NGViZWMtMzE0MS00MTI1LTg4YzAtNjdmYzcxMzFjYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"When it's suspected that her big-pharma client's vaccine has caused a mysterious illness affecting a handful of teenaged girls, high-powered attorney Joanna Hanley (Kristin Kreuk) returns to her hometown of Millwood to quickly and quietly settle the case."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I LOVE this show ! What is there NOT to like? Rich story lines, strongly portrayed (and very human) personalities you can really warm to who play off each other brilliantly, all with their own distinctive quirks and  above all  the always wonderful Mark Harmon as main character! What more could you ask for in a show?! There's not a single character I'd change  none that irritate  they're all excellent. I consider it a bonus that it's the one thing on TV that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons. Even my father-in-law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences! I was delighted when I heard that there was a second series imminent.

I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny.  And it was funny, and then some.  It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time.  I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.\n\nMichael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut.  The film never stops.  When it isn't action-packed, it is funny.  It is sexy, fun and always moving.  Christian Wagner's editing is phenomenal.  I love action movies that really try to be action movies.  A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably.  They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. "Bad Boys" doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story.  It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.\n\nWatch "Bad Boys" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish.  You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on.  There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this.  At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.\n\n"Bad Boys" of course isn't the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about "Bad Boys" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied.

For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nThose are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense.

But newbie writer, director and producer David Raymond should've maybe had one lesser top-lead and invested in a seasoned screenwriter and editor - of where this film failed drastically in a missed golden opportunity.\n\nThe screenplay had major plot and technical issues, that could've been easily avoided, or edited properly. Then the editing in general was atrocious. A few scenes popped in and out within seconds and made no sense. The music/score was so overbearing it was annoying, and in some scenes louder than the dialogue. Raymond's lack of directing experience was evident in the poor shaky-cam shots, as it was in his failure to direct his sub-cast properly (the seasoned pros clearly handled their own). Brendan Fletcher was perfectly cast and great playing the character of Simon. But casting Henry Cavill was a huge mistake. His acting was stale and unconvincing, as well as annoying with his monotonic dialogue and poorly executed macho demeanor.\n\nNevertheless, for a newbie writer and director (this film being his 2nd/3rd resume entry as a filmmaker), it was surprisingly decent all things considered. Too bad it could've been great with proper editing and screenplay review. Still, a solid and well deserving 7/10 from me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime"],"datePublished":"2019-08-08","keywords":"revenge,kidnapping,escape,twins,twin","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Night Hunter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2931277593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU5NTc3OTUtNjE5ZS00MGNhLWI3MGUtMDM0ZDE4ZmNmMDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU5NTc3OTUtNjE5ZS00MGNhLWI3MGUtMDM0ZDE4ZmNmMDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0147147/","name":"Henry Cavill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1275259/","name":"Alexandra Daddario"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2006019/","name":"David Raymond"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0630228/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0298559/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009056/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2006019/","name":"David Raymond"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But newbie writer, director and producer David Raymond should've maybe had one lesser top-lead and invested in a seasoned screenwriter and editor - of where this film failed drastically in a missed golden opportunity.\n\nThe screenplay had major plot and technical issues, that could've been easily avoided, or edited properly. Then the editing in general was atrocious. A few scenes popped in and out within seconds and made no sense. The music/score was so overbearing it was annoying, and in some scenes louder than the dialogue. Raymond's lack of directing experience was evident in the poor shaky-cam shots, as it was in his failure to direct his sub-cast properly (the seasoned pros clearly handled their own). Brendan Fletcher was perfectly cast and great playing the character of Simon. But casting Henry Cavill was a huge mistake. His acting was stale and unconvincing, as well as annoying with his monotonic dialogue and poorly executed macho demeanor.\n\nNevertheless, for a newbie writer and director (this film being his 2nd/3rd resume entry as a filmmaker), it was surprisingly decent all things considered. Too bad it could've been great with proper editing and screenplay review. Still, a solid and well deserving 7/10 from me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime"],"datePublished":"2019-08-08","keywords":"revenge,kidnapping,escape,twins,twin","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Night Hunter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2931277593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU5NTc3OTUtNjE5ZS00MGNhLWI3MGUtMDM0ZDE4ZmNmMDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU5NTc3OTUtNjE5ZS00MGNhLWI3MGUtMDM0ZDE4ZmNmMDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0147147/","name":"Henry Cavill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1275259/","name":"Alexandra Daddario"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2006019/","name":"David Raymond"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0630228/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0298559/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009056/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2006019/","name":"David Raymond"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny.  And it was funny, and then some.  It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time.  I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.\n\nMichael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut.  The film never stops.  When it isn't action-packed, it is funny.  It is sexy, fun and always moving.  Christian Wagner's editing is phenomenal.  I love action movies that really try to be action movies.  A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably.  They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. "Bad Boys" doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story.  It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.\n\nWatch "Bad Boys" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish.  You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on.  There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this.  At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.\n\n"Bad Boys" of course isn't the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about "Bad Boys" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1995-04-07","keywords":"miami florida,buddy movie,criminal investigation,murder investigation,usa","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bad Boys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2344091929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102288/","name":"Lisa Boyle"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057398/","name":"Michael Barrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611848/","name":"Jim Mulholland"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably.  They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. "Bad Boys" doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story.  It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.\n\nWatch "Bad Boys" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish.  You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on.  There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this.  At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.\n\n"Bad Boys" of course isn't the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about "Bad Boys" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1995-04-07","keywords":"miami florida,buddy movie,criminal investigation,murder investigation,usa","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bad Boys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2344091929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102288/","name":"Lisa Boyle"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057398/","name":"Michael Barrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611848/","name":"Jim Mulholland"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2819924, Title: Candice Renoir, 
 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen. Candice is like a female Columbo version in high heels, handbag pink scarf and a 9mm in her holster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt2819924/","name":"Candice Renoir","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM3YzUxM2UtZjIyMC00Zjg5LTk0NTMtNGQ3ZWQ0ODhlMTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0NTExNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Acting, camera work, jokes, and banter between coworkers, all served to create a believable environment. And that dark past of his, just waiting to be revealed and possibly destroy everything, hovers in the background, creating tension. I find myself waiting for the next episode. One reviewer complains about there being a personal story behind the main character, but that's how we end up finding out about that mysterious past of his. And, seriously, what do they want?

First, most of the main cast are extremely good actors. Vic, Aceveda and Shane were the most powerful. Second, the storyline and the length of the chapters are quite good too. Probably the story could have been told with 4-5 seasons easily. But it is what it is. Last, camera work, make up and sound are pretty cool. I can't believe this show started on 2002. On the other hand, seems some characters were not fully developed or look like the writers didn't want to give them credit. But not a big thing. So, overall if you're looking for an excellent cops show, brutal, raw and almost perfect, this one is for you. Now, I'm going to watch The Wire. I want to compare both shows and see which one is better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77198,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-12","keywords":"corrupt cop,los angeles california,made for cable tv,mayor,drugs","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004821/","name":"Michael Chiklis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413052/","name":"Michael Jace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439813/","name":"Jay Karnes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086397/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0203234/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752841/","name":"Shawn Ryan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Shield: Season Seven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi425591577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home video trailer for the final season of this cop show"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Make no mistake though, this is a really good film. It's highly entertaining, fast paced, and easily one of the most original screenplays of 2015 and perhaps of the past few years.\n\nWe follow a group of 'nerds' as they call themselves who are highly intelligent but also love 90's rap and jamming out themselves as their own band Awreeoh. It just so happens that they get caught up in a dangerously tricky situation involving some 'dope'. It's fair to say that most of what happens in the film is a bit too coincidental, it is. But what I loved most was this group of nerds and their reactions to each coinciding event. Shameik Moore plays the lead character, Malcom, and he does so wonderfully. If Moore plays his cards correctly, I think we will hear about this kid for years to come. \n\nMore importantly, you really buy into the groups dynamic. It never feels fake even when the situation surrounding them gets to be far- fetched. But I guess that also brings me to one of my negatives which is that after the first half or so it turns into Malcom's story. The first 45 minutes are great mainly because of the group's various endeavors. It's not a bad thing necessarily, it was just a tad less interesting.

Make no mistake though, this is a really good film. It's highly entertaining, fast paced, and easily one of the most original screenplays of 2015 and perhaps of the past few years.\n\nWe follow a group of 'nerds' as they call themselves who are highly intelligent but also love 90's rap and jamming out themselves as their own band Awreeoh. It just so happens that they get caught up in a dangerously tricky situation involving some 'dope'. It's fair to say that most of what happens in the film is a bit too coincidental, it is. But what I loved most was this group of nerds and their reactions to each coinciding event. Shameik Moore plays the lead character, Malcom, and he does so wonderfully. If Moore plays his cards correctly, I think we will hear about this kid for years to come. \n\nMore importantly, you really buy into the groups dynamic. It never feels fake even when the situation surrounding them gets to be far- fetched. But I guess that also brings me to one of my negatives which is that after the first half or so it turns into Malcom's story. The first 45 minutes are great mainly because of the group's various endeavors. It's not a bad thing necessarily, it was just a tad less interesting. There's also a message behind the film that arises around the last 15 minutes or so and I can definitely see where it would be jarring to people. It doesn't take you out of the film per se but it is something you just have to accept.\n\nSo Dope's first half is up in there in my most entertaining 45 minutes of 2015.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

But in THE LONGEST RIDE, the attempt barely mimics such success, primarily because of its confusing and ever shifting narrative, whose backbone runs on two romantic sagas spanning across different generations.\n\nTHE LONGEST RIDE sprawls across two love stories set in the modern day and seventy years ago. In modern day, it has Luke and Sophia, two utterly good-looking people, who at first sight falls in love with each other, they stumbles upon Ira, a World War II veteran, who himself, has his own epic love story to tell—that one he shared with his wife, Ruth, seventy years ago. More often, these two love stories bear no difference from each other, as both couples go through similar hardships to carry their relationships.\n\nThe idea of crisscrossing time to present two supposedly compelling love stories, perhaps, is to double the magnitude of emotions and deliver a more poignant result, yet such very confusing structure is what actually makes giving both the stories with equal level of sentiment, difficult. Still, no matter how one appears to hold more promise of an engaging love story than the other, the tedious and confusing process of going back and forth across two different time frames, and the fact that the narrative failed to establish concrete connection between the two stories, renders less than satisfying result. There's also this chemistry that Luke and Sophia seem to be lacking, regardless of how incredibly beautiful they are as persons, and that, may also be the reason why the other story, strikes as more riveting than theirs.

But in THE LONGEST RIDE, the attempt barely mimics such success, primarily because of its confusing and ever shifting narrative, whose backbone runs on two romantic sagas spanning across different generations.\n\nTHE LONGEST RIDE sprawls across two love stories set in the modern day and seventy years ago. In modern day, it has Luke and Sophia, two utterly good-looking people, who at first sight falls in love with each other, they stumbles upon Ira, a World War II veteran, who himself, has his own epic love story to tell—that one he shared with his wife, Ruth, seventy years ago. More often, these two love stories bear no difference from each other, as both couples go through similar hardships to carry their relationships.\n\nThe idea of crisscrossing time to present two supposedly compelling love stories, perhaps, is to double the magnitude of emotions and deliver a more poignant result, yet such very confusing structure is what actually makes giving both the stories with equal level of sentiment, difficult. Still, no matter how one appears to hold more promise of an engaging love story than the other, the tedious and confusing process of going back and forth across two different time frames, and the fact that the narrative failed to establish concrete connection between the two stories, renders less than satisfying result. There's also this chemistry that Luke and Sophia seem to be lacking, regardless of how incredibly beautiful they are as persons, and that, may also be the reason why the other story, strikes as more riveting than theirs. This makes the entirety of the movie—its interesting premise and structure yet often convoluted, and its thinly drawn characters—hard to appreciate and care about. Nevertheless, in the eyes of a true Sparks' fan, and of anyone easily drawn to such anthems, THE LONGEST RIDE easily serves its purpose.\n\nSpanning through generations and intertwining love affairs, THE LONGESTh RIDE would have been more satisfying had it treated both the stories with equal attention.

David Byrne's American Utopia is as much theatre as it is concert and as a result probably works better as a recorded concert film than most. I'm not going to tell you in matches the live performance. You can't replicate being in the room, feeling that spark of the occasion and sharing it with thousands. We can't share anything live right now though of course, so having this recording is something of a blessing. Here you get the luxury of multiple cameras, close ups, alternative perspectives and there is a lot to see. Live the show looks bravely simplistic. Byrne and his band, barefoot and decked out in matching grey suits, housed in box made of chain curtains, one side open to the audience. Every song is injected with creative lighting and dancing. It's every bit the performance. Unless you're a big Talking Heads fan, a traditional show might be dull, expected. Not hear though, it's wonderful whether you're a fan or not. This I think is largely due to it all looking so much damn fun, it's a celebration of music. The wires, amps, drum risers are all striped away. Each player is wireless, allowed to move freely and dance around one another. Not too surprising with the singers and the guitars, but to do this with keyboards and drums too, especially drums theres some seriously clever stuff going on there, well it looks like magic. It really is quite incredible, a good live band is a good live band, they're tight and controlled, fluid. To do it with this many players, whilst following choreographed routines is stunning. Byrne is charming and humble as he delivers short monologues between songs and he's in fine voice too. I am a fan, not a huge fan, but you get plenty of big hits alongside the American Utopia tracks to keep everyone happy and even through the screen, the joy of this music comes through. Perhaps most of all when the chains part in the curtains and more band members appear. With so much space, it's not unusual for a dozen people to perform together, creating not only a wonderful visual, but a fantastic sound too. Byrne is the conductor at the centre, orchestrating his vision. One of positivity and inclusivity. It's marvellous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4000,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Documentary","Music","Musical"],"datePublished":"2020-10-17","keywords":"two word title,broadway show,based on album,band,nationality in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1783217689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"David Byrne’s American Utopia brings the critically acclaimed Broadway show to HBO in a one-of-a-kind film directed by Oscar and Emmy-winner Spike Lee.

But in THE LONGEST RIDE, the attempt barely mimics such success, primarily because of its confusing and ever shifting narrative, whose backbone runs on two romantic sagas spanning across different generations.\n\nTHE LONGEST RIDE sprawls across two love stories set in the modern day and seventy years ago. In modern day, it has Luke and Sophia, two utterly good-looking people, who at first sight falls in love with each other, they stumbles upon Ira, a World War II veteran, who himself, has his own epic love story to tell—that one he shared with his wife, Ruth, seventy years ago. More often, these two love stories bear no difference from each other, as both couples go through similar hardships to carry their relationships.\n\nThe idea of crisscrossing time to present two supposedly compelling love stories, perhaps, is to double the magnitude of emotions and deliver a more poignant result, yet such very confusing structure is what actually makes giving both the stories with equal level of sentiment, difficult. Still, no matter how one appears to hold more promise of an engaging love story than the other, the tedious and confusing process of going back and forth across two different time frames, and the fact that the narrative failed to establish concrete connection between the two stories, renders less than satisfying result. There's also this chemistry that Luke and Sophia seem to be lacking, regardless of how incredibly beautiful they are as persons, and that, may also be the reason why the other story, strikes as more riveting than theirs. This makes the entirety of the movie—its interesting premise and structure yet often convoluted, and its thinly drawn characters—hard to appreciate and care about. Nevertheless, in the eyes of a true Sparks' fan, and of anyone easily drawn to such anthems, THE LONGEST RIDE easily serves its purpose.\n\nSpanning through generations and intertwining love affairs, THE LONGESTh RIDE would have been more satisfying had it treated both the stories with equal attention. That's not to say it has no small moments of perfection, because it does, but as a whole, the movie just falls below average.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80456,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance","Western"],"datePublished":"2015-04-15","keywords":"usa,united states,college student,college,bull riding","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2592911641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NTkwODY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwOTQ4NDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NTkwODY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwOTQ4NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The lives of a young couple intertwine with a much older man as he reflects back on a lost love while he's trapped in an automobile crash."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207222/","name":"Scott Eastwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1429380/","name":"Britt Robertson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863387/","name":"George Tillman Jr."}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0081189/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0817023/","name":"Nicholas Sparks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093271/","name":"Craig Bolotin"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

David Byrne's American Utopia is as much theatre as it is concert and as a result probably works better as a recorded concert film than most. I'm not going to tell you in matches the live performance. You can't replicate being in the room, feeling that spark of the occasion and sharing it with thousands. We can't share anything live right now though of course, so having this recording is something of a blessing. Here you get the luxury of multiple cameras, close ups, alternative perspectives and there is a lot to see. Live the show looks bravely simplistic. Byrne and his band, barefoot and decked out in matching grey suits, housed in box made of chain curtains, one side open to the audience. Every song is injected with creative lighting and dancing. It's every bit the performance. Unless you're a big Talking Heads fan, a traditional show might be dull, expected. Not hear though, it's wonderful whether you're a fan or not. This I think is largely due to it all looking so much damn fun, it's a celebration of music. The wires, amps, drum risers are all striped away. Each player is wireless, allowed to move freely and dance around one another. Not too surprising with the singers and the guitars, but to do this with keyboards and drums too, especially drums theres some seriously clever stuff going on there, well it looks like magic. It really is quite incredible, a good live band is a good live band, they're tight and controlled, fluid. To do it with this many players, whilst following choreographed routines is stunning. Byrne is charming and humble as he delivers short monologues between songs and he's in fine voice too. I am a fan, not a huge fan, but you get plenty of big hits alongside the American Utopia tracks to keep everyone happy and even through the screen, the joy of this music comes through. Perhaps most of all when the chains part in the curtains and more band members appear. With so much space, it's not unusual for a dozen people to perform together, creating not only a wonderful visual, but a fantastic sound too. Byrne is the conductor at the centre, orchestrating his vision. One of positivity and inclusivity. It's marvellous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4000,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Documentary","Music","Musical"],"datePublished":"2020-10-17","keywords":"two word title,broadway show,based on album,band,nationality in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1783217689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"David Byrne’s American Utopia brings the critically acclaimed Broadway show to HBO in a one-of-a-kind film directed by Oscar and Emmy-winner Spike Lee.

David Byrne's American Utopia is as much theatre as it is concert and as a result probably works better as a recorded concert film than most. I'm not going to tell you in matches the live performance. You can't replicate being in the room, feeling that spark of the occasion and sharing it with thousands. We can't share anything live right now though of course, so having this recording is something of a blessing. Here you get the luxury of multiple cameras, close ups, alternative perspectives and there is a lot to see. Live the show looks bravely simplistic. Byrne and his band, barefoot and decked out in matching grey suits, housed in box made of chain curtains, one side open to the audience. Every song is injected with creative lighting and dancing. It's every bit the performance. Unless you're a big Talking Heads fan, a traditional show might be dull, expected. Not hear though, it's wonderful whether you're a fan or not. This I think is largely due to it all looking so much damn fun, it's a celebration of music. The wires, amps, drum risers are all striped away. Each player is wireless, allowed to move freely and dance around one another. Not too surprising with the singers and the guitars, but to do this with keyboards and drums too, especially drums theres some seriously clever stuff going on there, well it looks like magic. It really is quite incredible, a good live band is a good live band, they're tight and controlled, fluid. To do it with this many players, whilst following choreographed routines is stunning. Byrne is charming and humble as he delivers short monologues between songs and he's in fine voice too. I am a fan, not a huge fan, but you get plenty of big hits alongside the American Utopia tracks to keep everyone happy and even through the screen, the joy of this music comes through. Perhaps most of all when the chains part in the curtains and more band members appear. With so much space, it's not unusual for a dozen people to perform together, creating not only a wonderful visual, but a fantastic sound too. Byrne is the conductor at the centre, orchestrating his vision. One of positivity and inclusivity. It's marvellous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4000,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Documentary","Music","Musical"],"datePublished":"2020-10-17","keywords":"two word title,broadway show,based on album,band,nationality in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1783217689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"David Byrne’s American Utopia brings the critically acclaimed Broadway show to HBO in a one-of-a-kind film directed by Oscar and Emmy-winner Spike Lee.

The scenes would be hard to do in standup because they involve a setup with circumstances and other characters - but it resembles standup in that each scene and the dialogue almost completely make up the substance and humor of the film. You have a well-intentioned millennial named Josh played by Justin Long who despite his best efforts simply cannot avoid putting his foot in his mouth. A large part of the humor deals with overly-sensitive and politically correct people, who Josh simply cannot avoid enraging - this comes out through taboo topics like sexual abuse, overly protected children, sexual philandering, and death. It's just hilarious to watch each scene spiral out of control with Josh coming out with mud on his face looking like the aggressor or bad guy, even though his intentions are good. He tries so hard to deal with each situation but just falls on his face and can never say the right thing, even when nearly one else has no problem doing so. So this dynamic is the setup for comedy; a series of blunders. I can see it compared to Woody Allen, mainly in Josh's hasty dialogue and frantic, victim mentality. But it's a little different, probably more like Amy Schumer - this is a little more of satire with dark, awkward, and deadpan humor. Josh has no redeeming qualities to speak of whereas Woody Allen's early characters seemed to be more cunning and find a way out on top. You won't get much of a story but if you like this type of humor you will be laughing out loud.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":671,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-15","keywords":"jew,jewish,teacher student relationship,adjunct professor,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"After Class","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1908522777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVlYjA0NDEtMDAxYy00MjVjLTgzYTEtNmRlOGE0MDUwNWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2547958/","name":"Kate Berlant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169565/","name":"Lynn Cohen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1633080/","name":"Daniel Schechter"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Anna Cieslak gives a strong performance as the fated Mariola, a young Polish girl, who's leaves her home looking for a brighter future, but ends up being delivered into the hands of devils.\n\nCieslak's performance is the strongest part of the movie. As a film it's competently realised, but also feels a little vacuous, although that same feeling works well alongside Cieslak's character, whom understandably is losing her self to the tortures she is forced into.\n\nAs with Lilja 4-Ever, Masz Na Imie Justine is an important film, that warns us of the evil that man can inflict, and it is a horror that is sadly all too real.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pig,slaughterhouse,toasting with a drink,drinking vodka,male female relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1752088/","name":"Anna Cieslak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295823/","name":"Arno Frisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533650/","name":"Rafal Mackowiak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143581/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121022/","name":"Chris Burdza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1268993/","name":"Tomasz Kepski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His on-screen presence is pretty much consists of witty lines, snappy articulation and boyish / non-threatening charm - and some element of nerves.\n\nHe's got that same appeal in this movie - and with the over-the-top acting of Tom Arnold, the film has great comedic performances. Still though, it lacks a compelling story.\n\nThe simple storyline never got interesting: an unmarried couple discovers they have a baby on the way. The soon-to-be father (Grant) seems uncomfortable with idea of becoming a responsible husband and father - leading to problems with the mother (Julianne Moore). Being in presence of a reckless family (headed by Arnold) just seems to make things worst ... and the story progresses from there.\n\nIf you're a Grant fan, you'll enjoy his part in the movie. However, get ready to also discover that it isn't enough to save this movie. It's just not that fun to watch."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36428,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-07-12","keywords":"time for title,bad dream,close up of eyes,close up of lips,close up of mouth","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nine Months","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2812084505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0105317/","name":"Patrick Braoudé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His on-screen presence is pretty much consists of witty lines, snappy articulation and boyish / non-threatening charm - and some element of nerves.\n\nHe's got that same appeal in this movie - and with the over-the-top acting of Tom Arnold, the film has great comedic performances. Still though, it lacks a compelling story.\n\nThe simple storyline never got interesting: an unmarried couple discovers they have a baby on the way. The soon-to-be father (Grant) seems uncomfortable with idea of becoming a responsible husband and father - leading to problems with the mother (Julianne Moore). Being in presence of a reckless family (headed by Arnold) just seems to make things worst ... and the story progresses from there.\n\nIf you're a Grant fan, you'll enjoy his part in the movie. However, get ready to also discover that it isn't enough to save this movie. It's just not that fun to watch.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36428,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1995-07-12","keywords":"time for title,bad dream,close up of eyes,close up of lips,close up of mouth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nine Months","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2812084505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljYWMxZTUtNTQxYy00Yjc2LWI3MDEtYTNiYTQzMDZiMzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0105317/","name":"Patrick Braoudé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The scenes would be hard to do in standup because they involve a setup with circumstances and other characters - but it resembles standup in that each scene and the dialogue almost completely make up the substance and humor of the film. You have a well-intentioned millennial named Josh played by Justin Long who despite his best efforts simply cannot avoid putting his foot in his mouth. A large part of the humor deals with overly-sensitive and politically correct people, who Josh simply cannot avoid enraging - this comes out through taboo topics like sexual abuse, overly protected children, sexual philandering, and death. It's just hilarious to watch each scene spiral out of control with Josh coming out with mud on his face looking like the aggressor or bad guy, even though his intentions are good. He tries so hard to deal with each situation but just falls on his face and can never say the right thing, even when nearly one else has no problem doing so. So this dynamic is the setup for comedy; a series of blunders. I can see it compared to Woody Allen, mainly in Josh's hasty dialogue and frantic, victim mentality. But it's a little different, probably more like Amy Schumer - this is a little more of satire with dark, awkward, and deadpan humor. Josh has no redeeming qualities to speak of whereas Woody Allen's early characters seemed to be more cunning and find a way out on top.

But in THE LONGEST RIDE, the attempt barely mimics such success, primarily because of its confusing and ever shifting narrative, whose backbone runs on two romantic sagas spanning across different generations.\n\nTHE LONGEST RIDE sprawls across two love stories set in the modern day and seventy years ago. In modern day, it has Luke and Sophia, two utterly good-looking people, who at first sight falls in love with each other, they stumbles upon Ira, a World War II veteran, who himself, has his own epic love story to tell—that one he shared with his wife, Ruth, seventy years ago. More often, these two love stories bear no difference from each other, as both couples go through similar hardships to carry their relationships.\n\nThe idea of crisscrossing time to present two supposedly compelling love stories, perhaps, is to double the magnitude of emotions and deliver a more poignant result, yet such very confusing structure is what actually makes giving both the stories with equal level of sentiment, difficult. Still, no matter how one appears to hold more promise of an engaging love story than the other, the tedious and confusing process of going back and forth across two different time frames, and the fact that the narrative failed to establish concrete connection between the two stories, renders less than satisfying result. There's also this chemistry that Luke and Sophia seem to be lacking, regardless of how incredibly beautiful they are as persons, and that, may also be the reason why the other story, strikes as more riveting than theirs. This makes the entirety of the movie—its interesting premise and structure yet often convoluted, and its thinly drawn characters—hard to appreciate and care about. Nevertheless, in the eyes of a true Sparks' fan, and of anyone easily drawn to such anthems, THE LONGEST RIDE easily serves its purpose.\n\nSpanning through generations and intertwining love affairs, THE LONGESTh RIDE would have been more satisfying had it treated both the stories with equal attention.

That's not to say it has no small moments of perfection, because it does, but as a whole, the movie just falls below average.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80456,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance","Western"],"datePublished":"2015-04-15","keywords":"usa,united states,college student,college,bull riding","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2592911641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NTkwODY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwOTQ4NDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NTkwODY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwOTQ4NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The lives of a young couple intertwine with a much older man as he reflects back on a lost love while he's trapped in an automobile crash.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207222/","name":"Scott Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1429380/","name":"Britt Robertson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863387/","name":"George Tillman Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0081189/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0817023/","name":"Nicholas Sparks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093271/","name":"Craig Bolotin"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film "The Shindler's List" and instead filmed "The Pianist". We should be very grateful to film authors.

It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film "The Shindler's List" and instead filmed "The Pianist". We should be very grateful to film authors. PS - People who give this film a low rating obviously have not seen it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-08-20","keywords":"childhood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1058543/","name":"Ryszard Horowitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7061785/","name":"Bronislawa Horowitz Karakulska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0701909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

David Byrne's American Utopia is as much theatre as it is concert and as a result probably works better as a recorded concert film than most. I'm not going to tell you in matches the live performance. You can't replicate being in the room, feeling that spark of the occasion and sharing it with thousands. We can't share anything live right now though of course, so having this recording is something of a blessing. Here you get the luxury of multiple cameras, close ups, alternative perspectives and there is a lot to see. Live the show looks bravely simplistic. Byrne and his band, barefoot and decked out in matching grey suits, housed in box made of chain curtains, one side open to the audience. Every song is injected with creative lighting and dancing. It's every bit the performance. Unless you're a big Talking Heads fan, a traditional show might be dull, expected. Not hear though, it's wonderful whether you're a fan or not. This I think is largely due to it all looking so much damn fun, it's a celebration of music. The wires, amps, drum risers are all striped away. Each player is wireless, allowed to move freely and dance around one another. Not too surprising with the singers and the guitars, but to do this with keyboards and drums too, especially drums theres some seriously clever stuff going on there, well it looks like magic. It really is quite incredible, a good live band is a good live band, they're tight and controlled, fluid. To do it with this many players, whilst following choreographed routines is stunning. Byrne is charming and humble as he delivers short monologues between songs and he's in fine voice too. I am a fan, not a huge fan, but you get plenty of big hits alongside the American Utopia tracks to keep everyone happy and even through the screen, the joy of this music comes through. Perhaps most of all when the chains part in the curtains and more band members appear. With so much space, it's not unusual for a dozen people to perform together, creating not only a wonderful visual, but a fantastic sound too. Byrne is the conductor at the centre, orchestrating his vision. One of positivity and inclusivity. It's marvellous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4000,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Documentary","Music","Musical"],"datePublished":"2020-10-17","keywords":"two word title,broadway show,based on album,band,nationality in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1783217689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMzZjE1ZWItNDZlNC00YWVjLWIzZDctMjI3ODJhZTI1OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"David Byrne’s American Utopia brings the critically acclaimed Broadway show to HBO in a one-of-a-kind film directed by Oscar and Emmy-winner Spike Lee.

The storyline is like a animal blazed trail in the wilderness, if you don't pay attention, you don't even know where it is. There's nothing in this movie except some so so songs. Because of the awkward script, Elle Fanning was forced to play a boring and hollow character. There's no way a person like she played could sing from the heart. I rarely found a movie with such huge nothingness to tell.

The storyline is like a animal blazed trail in the wilderness, if you don't pay attention, you don't even know where it is. There's nothing in this movie except some so so songs. Because of the awkward script, Elle Fanning was forced to play a boring and hollow character. There's no way a person like she played could sing from the heart. I rarely found a movie with such huge nothingness to tell.

I brought my daughter to see the movie today -- we both had tears in our eyes throughout the movie. The acting was superb, as was the casting. Normally I like to read the book before seeing a movie, as usually the book is so much better. I am glad that my daughter talked me into going to this movie. I think cinematically, it was one of the prettiest movies I've seen in awhile. You are taken from laughing one moment to feeling as though your heart is being tugged out of your body in the next moment. I will definitely be recommending this film to my friends!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25715,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary.

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If the first feature is satisfying on the screen, the second one is hardly perceptible. Hence, this crucial question: is it possible to fully recreate Flaubert's novel? Chabrol's film is faithful to the main plot with the rise and fall of her heroine sometimes told by François Périer's voice-over in spite of accelerated views on certain vital episodes, notably the peasant marriage that disgusted Emma Bovary.

But it's only skimmed over and it's a wasted bonanza.\n\nChabrol's reading of "Madame Bovary" amounts to the same result as Claude Berri's adaptation of Emile Zola's epic novel "Germinal" in 1993: honorable instead of being unforgettable, a commendable action instead of a ground-breaking creation. The author of "le Boucher" (1970) was rather on the wrong track but fortunately, he'll find his way again the following year with another woman depiction: "Betty" (1992).

Still, from the director's Q+A from the Toronto International Film Festival, the idea of subjective truth that also infuses the film can be a distraction.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-03","keywords":"east germany,painter,doctor,forced abortion,pregnancy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1224587801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Never Look Away' follows thirty years in the life of artist Kurt Barnert (a character loosely based on Gerhard Richter).

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yes, there is a plot but it could be told in a couple of lines and is not important after all. What we watch in this movie is life in a small town in Galicia, in the northwest corner of Spain. The language is mostly Galician with a few Spanish interpolations. Actors are local people, play themselves with their own names and go about their everyday chores apparently oblivious to the camera. The are glimpses of Galicia's reality such as migration of young people to the cities, excessive logging of forests, dedicated firemen with woefully few resources, a villager trying to improve a ruined dwelling into a casa rural (rural house) fit for prospective tourists. The climate is mild and rainy but the summers are dry, facilitating forest fires that are sometimes the result of arson. Both the melancholic winter landscapes and the summer fires are strikingly put on screen.\n\nDirector and scriptwriter Oliver Laxe, scriptwriter Santiago Fillol and cinematographer Mauro Herce have joined forces to produce a masterpiece where the boundary between living and acting is blurry and where we find ourselves in the middle of the action for the duration of the movie. An exceptional work that makes us reflect on the nature of cinema.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-04","keywords":"fire,cow,dog,funeral,forest","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3098394393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI4MWIxNjktMDkzZS00YWM1LTgzYzYtMjJlZjZiYmIzNjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI4MWIxNjktMDkzZS00YWM1LTgzYzYtMjJlZjZiYmIzNjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10715877/","name":"Amador Arias"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10715878/","name":"Benedicta Sánchez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10972726/","name":"Inazio Abrao"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890574/","name":"Oliver Laxe"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0296386/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0519364/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276971/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3277567/","name":"Santiago Fillol"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890574/","name":"Oliver Laxe"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yes, there is a plot but it could be told in a couple of lines and is not important after all. What we watch in this movie is life in a small town in Galicia, in the northwest corner of Spain. The language is mostly Galician with a few Spanish interpolations. Actors are local people, play themselves with their own names and go about their everyday chores apparently oblivious to the camera. The are glimpses of Galicia's reality such as migration of young people to the cities, excessive logging of forests, dedicated firemen with woefully few resources, a villager trying to improve a ruined dwelling into a casa rural (rural house) fit for prospective tourists. The climate is mild and rainy but the summers are dry, facilitating forest fires that are sometimes the result of arson. Both the melancholic winter landscapes and the summer fires are strikingly put on screen.\n\nDirector and scriptwriter Oliver Laxe, scriptwriter Santiago Fillol and cinematographer Mauro Herce have joined forces to produce a masterpiece where the boundary between living and acting is blurry and where we find ourselves in the middle of the action for the duration of the movie. An exceptional work that makes us reflect on the nature of cinema.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-04","keywords":"fire,cow,dog,funeral,forest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3098394393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI4MWIxNjktMDkzZS00YWM1LTgzYzYtMjJlZjZiYmIzNjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI4MWIxNjktMDkzZS00YWM1LTgzYzYtMjJlZjZiYmIzNjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10715877/","name":"Amador Arias","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10715878/","name":"Benedicta Sánchez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10972726/","name":"Inazio Abrao"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890574/","name":"Oliver Laxe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0296386/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0519364/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276971/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3277567/","name":"Santiago Fillol","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890574/","name":"Oliver Laxe"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Remember too that I haven't seen it since 1969. But it did make a strong impression.\n\nThe Long Day's Dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made. It achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in Northwestern Europe in 1944-45. No film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail, and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no subtlety either. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat, familiar cliché's. As "entertainment," the film doesn't make it, though it was clearly not intended to "entertain." It was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of World War II and modern war in general. This was twenty years before Platoon and thirty before Saving Private Ryan, both of which are far more "watchable" films. Here the flat and generally disagreeable characters, the lack of an actual plot, and the realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first on-screen vomit in theatrical history) make the film hard to sit through, though it is only 95 minutes.\n\nSo, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over, a bonus star for having its heart in the right place. Average: 8.\n\nLike Carl Foreman's underrated "The Victors," an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought-provoking film, The Long Day's Dying seems not to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been on cable a number of times.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1968-05-28","keywords":"shot to death,no survivors,farmhouse,corpse,cult film","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0376101/","name":"David Hemmings"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065777/","name":"Tony Beckley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068552/","name":"Tom Bell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0172772/","name":"Peter Collinson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010407/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924430/","name":"Alan White"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939606/","name":"Charles Wood"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And it kinda works. Works because the topics at hand - relationships, diversity and why we love - are universal enough to carry a twilight zone scenario.\n\nWhat could have been a comedic mess, or a ridiculous sci-fi drama, instead turns out to be a charming, clever little film, delivering a table full of food for thought.

Well, the same someone who happens to inhabit a different skin upon waking. Great premise for a movie, so here we are.\n\n"Every Day" is one of those giddy teen fantasies riding on a boffo, supernatural twist, that attempts to handle a crazy concept in a serious manner. And it kinda works. Works because the topics at hand - relationships, diversity and why we love - are universal enough to carry a twilight zone scenario.\n\nWhat could have been a comedic mess, or a ridiculous sci-fi drama, instead turns out to be a charming, clever little film, delivering a table full of food for thought. Sure it gets a bit sappy at times, but the tissue industry needs the support.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20584,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-02-23","keywords":"singing in a car,mother daughter relationship,father daughter relationship,sister sister relationship,boyfriend girlfriend conflict","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1251457049","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI5ZmQwZGItZmEwYy00ZThiLWJjOTgtM2MyZWM1NjEzMTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI5ZmQwZGItZmEwYy00ZThiLWJjOTgtM2MyZWM1NjEzMTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"16-year-old Rhiannon falls in love with a mysterious spirit named "A" who inhabits a different body every day.

But neither of them wants to give up their house, and both remain living in it, getting on each other's nerves as they deliberately and maliciously annoy and attack each other, each in an attempt to get the other to give up and leave.\n\nIt's exactly the sort of film I don't normally enjoy, where two equally detestable parties go back and forth trying to one up each other with ridiculous shenanigans that are rarely funny and never make up for the ninety minutes of wasted time. It reminds me of dumb comedy films like Duplex—which pits neighbor against neighbor—and Are We There Yet?, in which Ice Cube goes up against his new girlfriend's mischievous kids. These sorts of films aren't typically my cup of tea, but it wasn't my turn to pick the movie, so I just sat back and watched.\n\nAnd then a funny thing occurred. Almost immediately, I got drawn into the story. That wasn't supposed to happen, but it did, and I was pleasantly surprised. I normally don't even care for Danny DeVito as a director, probably due to the fact that he made the awful Duplex, which I mentioned earlier. I mean, I did enjoy Matilda, but that was a family movie that I watched as a kid. War of the Roses was something else entirely, and despite my efforts, I couldn't help but enjoying it.\n\nIt tells the story in a different way than others of its kind. Things unfold naturally and totally believably. Sure, some of the stunts that the characters pull reach the same levels of ridiculousness as in those other films that I didn't like, but here we get the impression that it's done for the sake of the story, rather than for just another cheap laugh. Instead of yawning, I was wide sitting wide-eyed on the edge of my seat. It's not just funny; it's also very real and poignant, especially considering the fact that most of us know someone who's had a really tough divorce and it's easy to see how things could go just as bad as they do in War of the Roses.\n\nAnd, unlike most of these kinds of movies and apart from my expectations, we actually end up caring about the characters, despite their overabundance of flaws. They're both selfish idiots, which makes the story so much better, but they're still believable and very well acted. From moment to moment we find ourselves siding with each one. Neither of them could be called true protagonists, as they constantly antagonize each other, but there's a balance of both deserved animosity and loathsomeness between them that is very well done. They got good actors to play these roles, and they play them so well that we almost don't notice that it could have been much worse in the hands of anyone else.\n\nThe whole story is told by Danny DeVito, who plays a divorce attorney who is telling it as a warning to a prospective client who never says a word during the entire film. And the ending is great. I won't spoil it, but trust me, it's a good one. This definitely isn't the best film I've seen, but it's certainly the best of its kind, and makes me reconsider my attitude toward this type of film.

We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":577129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-01-10","keywords":"loneliness,romance with artificial intelligence,divorce,future,artificial intelligence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4112492569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":" A lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.

If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":577129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-01-10","keywords":"loneliness,romance with artificial intelligence,divorce,future,artificial intelligence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4112492569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":" A lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.

As Ridley Scott's new film details, this isn't really the case aside from the point of 'rose up from nothing became something through crime', which could be said about almost every gangster film including the Godfather. Here Scott and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, without calling attention to it ala Paul Haggis, have made a film about class issues underneath the typical gangster-movie form. Even more than the Departed, one sees as the film goes on an environment of paradox: Frank Lucas was a low-life, a killer, a ruthless thug, and at the same time found time to take his mother to church every Sunday and gave out turkeys to folks in the neighborhood while providing them enough dope to die off in the process.\n\nIn fact, Scarface has got nothing on Frank Lucas when it comes to moral complexity: here's a man who did rise up out of poverty, learned the stakes of gang life as a driver for the Harlem boss for fifteen years, and then after he died cut out the middle-man as an importer of the freshest product of heroin right out of Vietnam. Then through this there's a whole other level to American Gangster; Scott and Zaillian could have made it simply a saga of betrayals and investigation via Richie Roberts. But the side that one saw in Serpico is amplified here- it becomes all the more engrossing to see how the crooked cops and "honest" gangster Lucas were linked together, which also leads to an ending that amps up the interest. Lucas didn't get out like Henry Hill, but a good man all the same? Probably not (he ended up in jail again, as the film doesn't point out).\n\nSo there's a lot of story to explore, and Scott makes it one of the most invigorating, nostalgic (ironically speaking) New York crime films in years, as far as the storytelling goes. And like Heat, Scott gets a lot of mileage from his star power. Washington goes even deeper into the role of the villain than he did in Training Day- he plays him as classic family man, cold businessman, and charming man-of-the-community. He makes it so much his role that you can't imagine anyone else going down a Harlem street shooting a guy point blank in the head. And Crowe also adds some good subtlety to the piece, a flawed man with his family and someone who tries to keep his morality straight (the million dollars given in to the station) amidst total bully-crooks like Josh Brolin's "special" detective. By the time the two stars finally sit down for one scene, it's on par with De Niro and Pacino.\n\nWhy not a 10/10 or 4 stars? It is, despite a rightfully fleshed out narrative, with some unnecessary bits (Cuba Gooding Jr, what happened there?) on a two hour and forty minute picture. But Scott does make American Gangster gain momentum as it goes along and reaches a powerhouse climax that is first intense and bloody (it IS Scott after all), followed by a striking human angle. And it holds nothing on Scarface, at the end of it all, as far as being legitimately dramatic without the ham, as the actors and director click for most part on material that just needs to be told without any pretension- and with that dose of significance of real urban crime in the 1970s in NYC.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":412147,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-01-09","keywords":"gangster,erect nipples,mentor,heroin,vietnam","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"American Gangster","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3216048409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"American Gangster Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414893/","name":"Mark Jacobson"}],"duration":"PT2H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So, it's with great reluctance that I write a less than stellar review of "Stuck On You".\n\nIt's not a horrible film, but like many recent Farrelly releases it's muddled and illustrates a tug of war between the movies the Farrellys want to make the and movies the Farrelly's fans want them to make.\n\n"Stuck On You" tells the tale of Bob and Walt Tenor, conjoined twins who live a good, peaceful life on Nantucket Island. That is until Walt (played by Greg Kinnear) catches the acting bug and wants to move to LA. The story and gags from there mostly revolve around a fish-out-of-water story (but two fish joined at the side) and the brothers' ongoing ignorance of their own condition.\n\nAt one point, Bob (played by Matt Damon) tells Walt that he'll never make it in acting. Why? Because he needs a better tan. Though these aren't the idiot gags that we all enjoyed in "Dumb &amp; Dumber". In fact, both of the brothers are very bright. Their ignorance is more a function of their being so close (physically and emotionally) for such a long period of time and because back home everyone accepted them completely. They've become blind to their own handicap.\n\nIt's a nice message and it is delivered poignantly at times. More often, though, we're hammered with it over and over again while the Farrellys do their best to make the movie look more like one of their more celebrated, more tasteless, and funnier movies like "Dumb &amp; Dumber", "Something About Mary", or "Me, Myself and Irene".\n\nIn all of the latter movies, there was no illusion that we were there primarily there for the gutter chuckles, but each movie also had characters we really liked. Let's face it. We were all rooting for Lloyd and Harry in "Dumb and Dumber" even if they were morons.\n\nIn "Stuck On You", the main characters are all a lot flatter than what we've seen before. Plus, one of the most disappointing aspects in "Stuck On You" is the poor use of the minor characters. In previous movies we got some of our biggest laughs from the sideline characters, while in "Stuck On You" they're used mostly as window dressing. Eva Mendes is primarily a cleavage delivery device in "Stuck On You", which is a shame because she's not a bad actress and she could have some comedic chops.\n\nHow are Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon in this film? They both do as good as can be expected. We're not used to seeing Damon in comedic films (his last was "Dogma"), and I think he does comedy very well. I'm reluctant to comment directly on their performances because it's not fair. The characters are flat and that's not their fault.\n\nSadly, this isn't a fluke for the Farrellys. It's part of an ongoing trend. Their animated movie, "Osmosis Joe", more closely resembled a feature-length public health announcement starring Chris Rock and Bill Murray. "Shallow Hal" dealt with superficiality in much heavier, dramatic tones than we were led to believe in the movie's trailers.*\n\nIn "Stuck On You", the Farrellys try to swerve back to their poop-and-fart-joke roots, but deep down you can tell they want to make more serious, thematic movies.\n\nI would have no problem if the Farrellys decided to do a more serious, dramatic film. I would also have no problem if the Farrellys decided to do more locker-room humor comedies. But I do have a problem with them trying to do both at the same time. It's just not working.\n\n* NOTE - While I'm not shopping for the DVD, I did enjoy "Shallow Hal" once I realized (and accepted) that the movie was a lot heavier than the trailers depicted. That said, there were a lot of people in the cinema who were expecting something like "Dumb &amp; Dumber" and they were plenty unhappy about it. I don't blame them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52539,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-02-18","keywords":"internet,conjoined twins,motel,porn star,2000s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stuck on You","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2374481433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NzY2MzE4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI0MjYyMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NzY2MzE4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI0MjYyMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Stuck on You"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578949/","name":"Eva Mendes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125803/","name":"Bobby Farrelly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268380/","name":"Peter Farrelly"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030016/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921853/","name":"Charles B.

Hunt turns to jewel thief Nyah to help him by infiltrating her ex-lover's (Ambrose) group to spy on them.\n\nJohn Woo must have thought of the elements he needed to follow up the solid thrills of the original movie.  Big action scenes? Yes.  Slow-motion? Yes. Plot?  Characters?  Good theme music?  Logic of any kind?  Nope  won't be needing those!  Or at least that's how it felt.

For example the car chase where Hunt and Nyah meet is just ridiculous and very annoying. The robbery of the disease is a pale shadow of the original film's robbery scene and the final motorbike chase is good but only a hint of what Woo has done before.  The plot overuses the whole `face mask' thing  it must do it about 8 or 9 times  many of those time's there's no way Hunt could have made a mask of the people involved!  It's another example of how silly it is.\n\nWhile Cruise was cool in the first film, here he is slick and tough  an image that doesn't work.  He was much better in the first film.  Scott is non-existent as a villain and is pretty dull.  Newton is sexy but no more than that.  Rhames is good and Hopkins has an enjoyable minor role.\n\nOverall this film is an OTT mess.  The plot is a shambles and the action scenes are silly and often have no logical reason behind them!  The overuse of the face masks just points to the total lack of a good script and Woo's slow motion just feels tired and unimaginative.  Only the final action scene is enjoyable, but by then you're ony interesting in turning this off and watching De Palma's much better film instead."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328995,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-05-24","keywords":"finger cut off,ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,time bomb,slit skirt","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779084/","name":"Dougray Scott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000247/","name":"John Woo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194528/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

Only the final action scene is enjoyable, but by then you're ony interesting in turning this off and watching De Palma's much better film instead.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328995,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-05-24","keywords":"finger cut off,ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,time bomb,slit skirt","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779084/","name":"Dougray Scott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000247/","name":"John Woo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194528/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell).  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.

Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue.  During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here.

Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed.

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average.

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release, so I ended up getting a little more than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining, to say the least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.\n\nShrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-08-04","keywords":"reference to spider man,ogre,cat,princess,puss in boots","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1447231513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0038432/","name":"Kelly Asbury"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0830294/","name":"Joe Stillman"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.\n\nShrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-08-04","keywords":"reference to spider man,ogre,cat,princess,puss in boots","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1447231513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0038432/","name":"Kelly Asbury","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0830294/","name":"Joe Stillman"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even if you're not a fan of UFC or MMA, the story will keep you entertained.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3317,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2021-01-22","keywords":"love,jiu jitsu,combat sport","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Born a Champion - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1456259353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU3MjQyYTMtYmFhNi00ZWMyLTkyZDktYmVjMjU0ZWY0YWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU3MjQyYTMtYmFhNi00ZWMyLTkyZDktYmVjMjU0ZWY0YWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2197298/","name":"Katrina Bowden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001218/","name":"Sean Patrick Flanery"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1156199/","name":"Alex Ranarivelo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0546549/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005694/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001218/","name":"Sean Patrick Flanery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1156199/","name":"Alex Ranarivelo"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I didn't actually see this movie in theaters, but I did rent it and was pleasantly surprised. Not everything is in black and white in this movie, and various stereotypes are broken. And things are not always what they seem. I loved the main characters and they all get my standing ovation. This, along with Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6 are my favorites of the non-Pixar Disney CGI films. If you like anthro animals and want to see them in a somewhat modern setting with no humans, look no further!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":465629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-03","keywords":"anthropomorphic animal,con artist,rabbit,police,mammal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi934327577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the animal city of Zootopia, a fast-talking fox who's trying to make it big goes on the run when he's framed for a crime he didn't commit.

Sadly, I didn't see Frozen when it was in theaters. The main reason was I didn't really pay much attention to advertisement for the movie. After hearing how Frozen was getting reviews about how amazing it was, I bought the Blu- Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack in April last year. When I watched the movie, I thought Frozen was a decent entry to the Disney library.\n\nMy main problem with the movie is the storyline. Some parts were far- fetched like how the parents handled Elsa's powers after the accident. Separating the two sisters and isolating Elsa only caused her powers to get out of hand at times. At least, Anna and Elsa turned out just fine after a decade of barely seeing each other. The addition of Grand Pappie and the other rock trolls was ridiculous. The rock trolls add nothing to the story. Also, they could've explained how to handle Elsa's powers better which would've made things a lot easier for the royal family. I really hated the twist with the movie's villain. It was obvious that it was tacked on last minute.\n\nI do like Anna and Elsa a lot. They're both great princesses in their own right. On the other hand, they do make stupid decisions that make no sense. One example is Elsa just running away from her problems and singing about how she doesn't care about what others think and acts like an idiot when Anna comes to see her in the ice castle that she created. Also, Anna stupidly decides to marry a prince that she barely knows. Despite their stupid decisions, I still like the two sisters along with Olaf the snowman.\n\nThe movie has beautiful animation like Tangled. It also has some great songs like Do You Want to Build a Snowman, For the First Time in Forever, and of course, Let It Go. Other songs should have been cut out like Fixer Upper because they add nothing to the story. I can't see how Frozen is anything like the movies from the Disney Renaissance era. It's good, but not that good. For a kid like me who grew up during the 1990's, it's hard to top movies like Aladdin, Lion King, and Mulan. Despite its flaws, I will still recommend Frozen to others.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":598412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-11-27","keywords":"magic,snowman,sister sister relationship,ice,snow","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""First Time in Forever" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2482677785","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk4NTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTc0MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk4NTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTc0MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Fearless optimist Anna teams up with Kristoff in an epic journey, encountering Everest-like conditions, and a hilarious snowman named Olaf in a race to find Anna's sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.

There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful, playful, loose genre-bending comedy with some outstanding performances, an inspired comedy script, and some great work from director David Gordon Green, certainly one of the finest young directors around.\n\nThe latter group is correct. "Pineapple Express" is, as a whole, the best movie the Apatow clan has produced yet. David Gordon Green is unquestionably the best director to direct one of these movies, but this is also a very different sort of movie than the films he usually directs. Does he rise to the challenge? He certainly does. I never would have believed that he was capable of directing such exciting and fun action scenes, or keep the movie's tone steady despite the different elements it consists of being so wildly disparate, but somehow he pulls it off. No other stoner movie can claim to be as artful and well-directed as this film.\n\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's much-anticipated follow-up to "Superbad" is an excellent screenplay, but expect none of the realism and resonance of that film; "Pineapple Express" is all about the laughs, and the laughs are certainly here, and they are practically non-stop, with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue, acting, or the sort of incredible sight gag this movie does so well. This is just great comedy throughout. \n\nIn addition to David Gordon Green's excellent work as director, the film is technically superb. The soundtrack and use of music is brilliant, and frequent Gordon Green collaborator Tim Orr's cinematography is consistently great. \n\n"Pineapple Express" will be an inherently divisive film. It didn't get the sort of critical accolades many previous Apatow clan movies did, and I expect audiences will also be a little less unanimous. Indeed, there's little of the critic-pleasing dramatic scenes Apatow's comedies have been praised for, and even when they do pop up they're usually deflated instantly with a joke, and credit has to go to director David Gordon Green for his expert handling of the film's tone, which never becomes schmaltzy, thank the heavens. Really, the whole film is throughly enjoyable except for the very last scene in the film, which contains one of the film's best jokes, but is really hard to buy given the state the characters are in, and also more than a little forced. Aside from that moment the whole thing works beautifully, quite astounding given the mesh of many different genres and sorts of comedy that this is. You either go with this movies sense of humor or you don't, and I imagine more people will enjoy the first three quarters of the movie, before the big, long action scene happens, and lots and lots of violence occurs. I guess you have to have a somewhat morbid sense of humor to laugh at ALL of the jokes in the film, but so what? There are also some nice little tongue-in-cheek references to the film's influences ("they messed with the wrong melon farmers"). \n\nThe cast really give it their all. It was great to see James Franco back in a comedic role, and his performance steals the show. Rogen is good as usual, Gary Cole is a perfect villain, and it's nice to see the gorgeous and talented Amber Heard finally make a quality film (and get one of the film's funniest scenes as her character's final scene). The supporting cast are also all good in their roles.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why "Pineapple Express" won't work for many people, and they will probably end up being the very reasons the film works for those who like it. The film's plot is inherently silly to an extent (although this is nowhere near the "Anchorman" style of comedy), and one must be prepared for an outright comedy and not something in the vein of "Knocked Up". "Pineapple Express" may end up being more enjoyable for stoners and those with friends who are stoners, but it works on its own as great comedy because the humor has much more range and scope than just marijuana. One of the best comedies in years.\n\n9/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328977,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up,handcuffed man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful, playful, loose genre-bending comedy with some outstanding performances, an inspired comedy script, and some great work from director David Gordon Green, certainly one of the finest young directors around.\n\nThe latter group is correct. "Pineapple Express" is, as a whole, the best movie the Apatow clan has produced yet. David Gordon Green is unquestionably the best director to direct one of these movies, but this is also a very different sort of movie than the films he usually directs. Does he rise to the challenge? He certainly does. I never would have believed that he was capable of directing such exciting and fun action scenes, or keep the movie's tone steady despite the different elements it consists of being so wildly disparate, but somehow he pulls it off. No other stoner movie can claim to be as artful and well-directed as this film.\n\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's much-anticipated follow-up to "Superbad" is an excellent screenplay, but expect none of the realism and resonance of that film; "Pineapple Express" is all about the laughs, and the laughs are certainly here, and they are practically non-stop, with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue, acting, or the sort of incredible sight gag this movie does so well.

All in all it is a truly magical experience from beginning to end, and I now Im raving about it to EVERYONE!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265282,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2007-10-24","keywords":"witch,magic,transformation,shooting star,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stardust","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4018471193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM0NDhmOGMtNjk3MS00ZjFkLThhOGQtZmZiYmY5OWI2MDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM0NDhmOGMtNjk3MS00ZjFkLThhOGQtZmZiYmY5OWI2MDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1214435/","name":"Charlie Cox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000132/","name":"Claire Danes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1092227/","name":"Sienna Miller"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891216/","name":"Matthew Vaughn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165404/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0325567/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0963359/","name":"Jane Goldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891216/","name":"Matthew Vaughn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301274/","name":"Neil Gaiman"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not because it is a better movie, but because it's very different and a lot more ambitious. Of course that this has a downside, and it's fair to say it as soon as possible: "Australia" is flawed and longer than it should be, and maybe (just maybe) one day it will be viewed as the dream come true of a man very much in love with cinema, and-let's not forget-with love.\n\nWe shouldn't forget that we're talking about Baz Luhrman, we should know what to expect sometimes. Therefore, if the beginning of this film disappoints you a bit, it's completely understandable. We meet a little boy named Nullah (the very promising Brandon Walters), who talks about races and unnamed countries, about a lady everyone calls Mrs. Boss and the road that got her to Australia and more specifically to a place called Faraway Downs in the company of a man they call the Drover.\n\nYes, it's all quite confusing, even more when Luhrman throws in a historical context that, I suspect, he doesn't really care much about. But everything is fine because we get to meet the stars of the show. Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade. Her job ends up being less risky than Hugh Jackman's, who plays this Drover as a successful combination of what he's been giving us since he came into the scene: the action hero, the tough guy, the romantic and sensitive lover and the sexy man who makes women scream.\n\nMaybe I'm not being critical enough, but there's a scene in which the Drover appears dressed up in a suit, clean-shaven I promise you that every women in the theater exhaled. Does this mean something to you? To me, it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments? "Australia" is pure melodrama, and I compliment its director for making it look that way without any shame. The keys can be seen all along the ride: the repetition of clichéd phrases, the intense close-ups, the slow-motion parts of the characters, the epic proportions of David Hirschfelder's score, the establishment of a song that accompanies the characters through their endless journey and the use of narration in places it didn't need to be; the same with some images.\n\nHowever, the movie is one wonderful image after another (cinematographer Mandy Walker, from Australia-the country-; best of luck with the Oscar nomination you deserve), and it wins the audience like few movies out there these days can, providing delightful entertainment; you may discuss if it does this fairly, or if it cheats and it manipulates. You may also discuss the ambiguous ending.\n\nOne more thing.

Not because it is a better movie, but because it's very different and a lot more ambitious. Of course that this has a downside, and it's fair to say it as soon as possible: "Australia" is flawed and longer than it should be, and maybe (just maybe) one day it will be viewed as the dream come true of a man very much in love with cinema, and-let's not forget-with love.\n\nWe shouldn't forget that we're talking about Baz Luhrman, we should know what to expect sometimes. Therefore, if the beginning of this film disappoints you a bit, it's completely understandable. We meet a little boy named Nullah (the very promising Brandon Walters), who talks about races and unnamed countries, about a lady everyone calls Mrs. Boss and the road that got her to Australia and more specifically to a place called Faraway Downs in the company of a man they call the Drover.\n\nYes, it's all quite confusing, even more when Luhrman throws in a historical context that, I suspect, he doesn't really care much about. But everything is fine because we get to meet the stars of the show. Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade. Her job ends up being less risky than Hugh Jackman's, who plays this Drover as a successful combination of what he's been giving us since he came into the scene: the action hero, the tough guy, the romantic and sensitive lover and the sexy man who makes women scream.\n\nMaybe I'm not being critical enough, but there's a scene in which the Drover appears dressed up in a suit, clean-shaven I promise you that every women in the theater exhaled. Does this mean something to you? To me, it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments? "Australia" is pure melodrama, and I compliment its director for making it look that way without any shame. The keys can be seen all along the ride: the repetition of clichéd phrases, the intense close-ups, the slow-motion parts of the characters, the epic proportions of David Hirschfelder's score, the establishment of a song that accompanies the characters through their endless journey and the use of narration in places it didn't need to be; the same with some images.\n\nHowever, the movie is one wonderful image after another (cinematographer Mandy Walker, from Australia-the country-; best of luck with the Oscar nomination you deserve), and it wins the audience like few movies out there these days can, providing delightful entertainment; you may discuss if it does this fairly, or if it cheats and it manipulates. You may also discuss the ambiguous ending.\n\nOne more thing. As with any dream, there's a moment in which we wake up; and that moment for Luhrman has to do with believing his picture could get to the race of Best Picture contenders, like his fantastic "Moulin Rouge!". But as I said, this movie is very different from the latter one, and Luhrman is no James Cameron That one really had it the whole way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"soldier,1940s,prejudice,dog,airplane","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":430315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how "pretty" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. \n\nOverall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it.

So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how "pretty" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. \n\nOverall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":401734,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"villain,arcade,medal,jealousy,party","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version -- #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3621299225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNDk4NTU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM2OTY0OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNDk4NTU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM2OTY0OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The bad-guy character in a classic game who longs to be a hero brings trouble to his entire arcade after sneaking into a new first-person shooter game and unleashing a deadly enemy.

The actual plot weaves together many strands and I don't want to ruin the surprises for anyone, but at the barest it is the simple tale of a young man (Charlie Cox) in love with the village beauty (Sienna Miller). To win her love he tells her he will fetch back a fallen star from the other side of the Wall. Howver when he arrives at the star he finds not a lump of astral metal as he expected but a beautiful woman (Claire Danes). As the two journey back to the wall they find themselves in the adventure of a lifetime.

As well as this the acting good, especially from the leads and Robert DeNiro, whose turn as the captain of an airship is incredibly memorable.

Not because it is a better movie, but because it's very different and a lot more ambitious. Of course that this has a downside, and it's fair to say it as soon as possible: "Australia" is flawed and longer than it should be, and maybe (just maybe) one day it will be viewed as the dream come true of a man very much in love with cinema, and-let's not forget-with love.\n\nWe shouldn't forget that we're talking about Baz Luhrman, we should know what to expect sometimes. Therefore, if the beginning of this film disappoints you a bit, it's completely understandable. We meet a little boy named Nullah (the very promising Brandon Walters), who talks about races and unnamed countries, about a lady everyone calls Mrs. Boss and the road that got her to Australia and more specifically to a place called Faraway Downs in the company of a man they call the Drover.\n\nYes, it's all quite confusing, even more when Luhrman throws in a historical context that, I suspect, he doesn't really care much about. But everything is fine because we get to meet the stars of the show. Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade. Her job ends up being less risky than Hugh Jackman's, who plays this Drover as a successful combination of what he's been giving us since he came into the scene: the action hero, the tough guy, the romantic and sensitive lover and the sexy man who makes women scream.\n\nMaybe I'm not being critical enough, but there's a scene in which the Drover appears dressed up in a suit, clean-shaven I promise you that every women in the theater exhaled. Does this mean something to you? To me, it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments? "Australia" is pure melodrama, and I compliment its director for making it look that way without any shame. The keys can be seen all along the ride: the repetition of clichéd phrases, the intense close-ups, the slow-motion parts of the characters, the epic proportions of David Hirschfelder's score, the establishment of a song that accompanies the characters through their endless journey and the use of narration in places it didn't need to be; the same with some images.\n\nHowever, the movie is one wonderful image after another (cinematographer Mandy Walker, from Australia-the country-; best of luck with the Oscar nomination you deserve), and it wins the audience like few movies out there these days can, providing delightful entertainment; you may discuss if it does this fairly, or if it cheats and it manipulates. You may also discuss the ambiguous ending.\n\nOne more thing. As with any dream, there's a moment in which we wake up; and that moment for Luhrman has to do with believing his picture could get to the race of Best Picture contenders, like his fantastic "Moulin Rouge!".

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":430315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I really liked this movie though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great. Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again.

I really liked this movie though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great. Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost never happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute. This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people would enjoy it. 9/10!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":498396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-29","keywords":"divorce,marriage,unfaithfulness,adultery,marital problem","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3722091801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Newly single Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is taken on as wingman and protÃ©gÃ© to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).

His best friend is an even bigger nerd than he is and not as brainy and of course he fancies one of the it girls, while his sister is being bullied by some others. Weston is a very good looking actor, so trying to pass him off as a science geek is really a bit of a stretch one of the films weakest flaws but one I was prepared to forgive. This group form an unlikely alliance when they discover via one of David's deceased Dad's experiments, they have invented time travel. They jump together and change various things in their recent past and also do some fairly typical teenage things like go and win the lottery. Someone on here was moaning saying people wouldn't do that, they would go back and see people they loved and so on - well I am fairly certain as a teenager I would do both.\n\nOur lead character though cannot leave well enough alone and jumps once too often and the ripple effect begins to cause them problems.\n\nProject Almanac is a found footage film and these normally alone will cause me not to watch them but I found the premise of this one intriguing enough to seek it out. It's helped by a reasonably good script which plays out like a good episode of the Twilight Zone but what really helps the film is the cast. Its pretty rare that a group of teenage actors should all be universally so good, but that is certainly the case here. Sofia Black-D'Elia who more recently starred in Born of War is especially good and one I predict big things for while Sam Lerner who plays the thankless role of the Annoying friend clearly has taken on board everything his actor father taught him.

His best friend is an even bigger nerd than he is and not as brainy and of course he fancies one of the it girls, while his sister is being bullied by some others. Weston is a very good looking actor, so trying to pass him off as a science geek is really a bit of a stretch one of the films weakest flaws but one I was prepared to forgive. This group form an unlikely alliance when they discover via one of David's deceased Dad's experiments, they have invented time travel. They jump together and change various things in their recent past and also do some fairly typical teenage things like go and win the lottery. Someone on here was moaning saying people wouldn't do that, they would go back and see people they loved and so on - well I am fairly certain as a teenager I would do both.\n\nOur lead character though cannot leave well enough alone and jumps once too often and the ripple effect begins to cause them problems.\n\nProject Almanac is a found footage film and these normally alone will cause me not to watch them but I found the premise of this one intriguing enough to seek it out. It's helped by a reasonably good script which plays out like a good episode of the Twilight Zone but what really helps the film is the cast. Its pretty rare that a group of teenage actors should all be universally so good, but that is certainly the case here. Sofia Black-D'Elia who more recently starred in Born of War is especially good and one I predict big things for while Sam Lerner who plays the thankless role of the Annoying friend clearly has taken on board everything his actor father taught him. This really is a talented group of individuals. \n\nThe film reminded me of the 1980s cult film The Explorers and I found myself rooting for the hero towards the end because you wanted him to set everything right. I really enjoyed this film and stayed up really late when I was super tired to watch it. Thankfully I wasn't bored and I was with them until the end.

Someone roles repeat their craziness , thus , Julie Haggerty as the hostess , Robert Hays who's at the beginning in the ¨Ronald Reagan psychiatric hospital¨ , Peter Graves with his children' desires and the nutty air controller Lloyd Bridges . The film refers about the first journey headed to the moon by means of the space shuttle ¨The Mayflower I ¨.\n\nHilarious as well as silly spoof is loaded with nutty situations , irony , slapdash , slapstick , comedy with tongue-in-cheek , bad taste jokes , rapid flash thrilling choreography , funny situations and with a distinctly American sense of humor . As always , the cinematic references are numerous : ¨2001, space odyssey ¨ with a computer type ¨Hal¨, ¨Star Trek¨ with the intervention of William Shatner , ¨Mission impossible¨ with the acting by Peter Graves and the musical theme composed by Lalo Schifrin , ¨ET¨ with the likable creature made by Carlo Rambaldi doing a home phone call , ¨Star Wars¨ that since introducing titles the mentions are continued and , of course , ¨ Airport I ¨¨ which the allusions are sometimes copied . The film is an ¨Airport¨ spoof , the parody is hilarious , surrealist , extreme and gross-out but is also clever and bald . There're gags each twenty seconds , from start to finish , humor and laughters are interminable . The picture will appeal to wacky and absurd comedy fans . This film was created with the obligation that its creative team return for a third installment .

Someone roles repeat their craziness , thus , Julie Haggerty as the hostess , Robert Hays who's at the beginning in the ¨Ronald Reagan psychiatric hospital¨ , Peter Graves with his children' desires and the nutty air controller Lloyd Bridges . The film refers about the first journey headed to the moon by means of the space shuttle ¨The Mayflower I ¨.\n\nHilarious as well as silly spoof is loaded with nutty situations , irony , slapdash , slapstick , comedy with tongue-in-cheek , bad taste jokes , rapid flash thrilling choreography , funny situations and with a distinctly American sense of humor . As always , the cinematic references are numerous : ¨2001, space odyssey ¨ with a computer type ¨Hal¨, ¨Star Trek¨ with the intervention of William Shatner , ¨Mission impossible¨ with the acting by Peter Graves and the musical theme composed by Lalo Schifrin , ¨ET¨ with the likable creature made by Carlo Rambaldi doing a home phone call , ¨Star Wars¨ that since introducing titles the mentions are continued and , of course , ¨ Airport I ¨¨ which the allusions are sometimes copied . The film is an ¨Airport¨ spoof , the parody is hilarious , surrealist , extreme and gross-out but is also clever and bald . There're gags each twenty seconds , from start to finish , humor and laughters are interminable . The picture will appeal to wacky and absurd comedy fans . This film was created with the obligation that its creative team return for a third installment . Expectations were so high that the next film was promised at the end of the credits of this one , when the film was released to mediocre box office , plans for Airplane III was doomed .

Richard Gere plays John Clark, a lawyer who feels the need to spice up his stagnating marriage (to Susan Sarandon, no less) by taking ballroom dance lessons from a beautiful and mysterious younger woman (Jennifer Lopez). The plot is okay it just sounds kind of boring. The movie for the most part isn't boring. Its actually quite entertaining. I have never seen the original so I can't compare the two but the original is probably better. I was expecting this film to be horrible as the trailer and early buzz weren't that good but they must have fixed the problems. The cast is pretty good with the best being Susan Sarandon. She does a very good job and she has a fair amount of screen time. Richard Gere does a good job playing John, nothing great but nothing terrible either. Jennifer Lopez's performance isn't very strong and the role didn't really seem to fit her. She gets by with an average performance though. The rest of the supporting cast are very funny and they keep this film moving. Out of all of them, Stanley Tucci was probably the best as Link. His performance of trying to be a young dancer was very funny. There are other interesting characters as well that are in the dance school and are fun to watch them. Peter Chelsom directs and he sure knows how to make this type of film work as he directed the very entertaining Serendipity. The only problem with this film is that its too predictable. Its very by the numbers and doesn't even try to stray away from the familiar path that most romantic comedies take. There was also a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Gere so there scenes together weren't very good or interesting. The running time of 106 minutes goes by fast. The dancing itself was actually pretty good. It wasn't the best but it wasn't terrible either. In the end, this is better then most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year and this film can be enjoyed if your just looking for a good time. Rating 7/10, entertaining but forgettable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46127,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-12-22","keywords":"dance instructor,2000s,dance class,middle aged couple,middle aged man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shall We Dance?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi802201113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYzMzZmNmItZWI3Yy00NTg5LTkzNTgtZGY3YTE3YWUxN2Y4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYzMzZmNmItZWI3Yy00NTg5LTkzNTgtZGY3YTE3YWUxN2Y4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000182/","name":"Jennifer Lopez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000215/","name":"Susan Sarandon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0155093/","name":"Peter Chelsom"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0839397/","name":"Masayuki Suô"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0920108/","name":"Audrey Wells"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He owns a cafe, Café René, and his life is going as usual: He cheats his wife Edith (Carmen Silvera) with his two waitresses Yvette and Maria (Vicky Michelle and Francesca Gonshaw) and business goes as usual. The life of Frenchman René is going like he wants it to go, nice and steady. Nothing should change. But one detail will foil this from happening: The second World War. (Or as it is said brilliantly in the series more than once 'There is a war on, you know.') Before he knows what has happened René Artois is hiding two British airman, Fairfax and Carstairs (John D. Collins and Nicolas Frankau) from the nazi's, is he the helper of the French resistant, he has to stay friends with the Germans (they are good for business and for staying alive) and avoid interfering with the Gestapo while he's breaking almost all of the nazi rules and his life is totally disturbed. In the very first episode of the series this is all shown. For the fans of  ''Allo 'Allo' this first episode is a must-see. \n\nFrom now on René has got to do the most crazy, stupid, embarrassing and funny things to try to get the airman back to Britain, with the help of Michelle ''Listen very careful, I will say this only once'' of the resistance (Kirsten Cooke) who always comes up with a plan to avoid the Nazi's in the attempt to get the airman back home. Of course these plans always fail to happen on the most strange and remarkable ways, what keeps Fairfax and Carstairs at 'Café René' in the most miraculous and dumb hiding places. \n\nLuckily the Nazi's aren't the smartest and hardest people in the town of Nouvion. Colonel Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and his assistant Captain Hans Geering (Sam Kelly, later replaced by Captain Alberto Bertorelli, played by Gavin Richards), for instance, never seem to see Michelle of the resistance when she comes in the café 'nondescript', probably 'cause they're to busy having a good time whit waitresses Yvette and Maria (and later on in the series when Maria is gone little Mimi, played by Sue Hodge). Luckily for René he is in a plot with the colonel and the captain about the painting 'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp. The men want to sell it after the war instead of giving it to Hitler and René has to hide the painting in his sausages. So, the colonel and the captain need René.\n\nOne of the other nazi's in the little town is Lieutenant Herbert Gruber (Guy Siner).The reason René and his wife and waitresses don't get caught by him is because he fancies René. That's why Gruber is always willing to lend a hand (or more) to help out the café owner. Needless to say the situation between René and Lieutenant Gruber creates a lot of memorable funny scenes, for instance when René, who's always nervous with Gruber around, is dressed like a woman (all part of a plan from Michelle to get the airman back to Britain) and the Lieutenant comes in the café, or when René had just got back from a hospital (again because of a plan from Michelle) late at night and has only a hospital nighty on, one without a back and the lieutenant enters the café. Von Strohm, Geering and Gruber aren't such a problem for the café owner, but the Gestapo on the other hand is something timid René Artois fears even more than he fears his wife Edith finding out about his affairs with the waitresses. Not without reason; Herr Flick (Richard Gibson, in the last season played by David Janson) and his little helper Von Smallhousen (John Louise Mansi) are working all the time to rule out the resistance in Nouvion with René as the prime suspect. They also have a female assistant 'a woman of the opposite sex' named Private Helga Geerhard (Kim Hartman), but what Flick and Von Smallhousen don't know is that she double-crosses the two Gestapo-officers. She helps the colonel and the captain because she knows about their plan with the painting and also wants a part of the money from the 'Fallen Madonna with the big boobies' by Van Klomp. Besides enemy's René also has a lot of friends who are also against the nazi's. The already mentioned Michelle and the two airmen, but there are more: For Instance there is the undertaker Monsieur Alphonse (Kenneth Connor) who fancies Madame Edith but has to much admiration for the brave resistance hero René Artois to take her away from him, Monsieur 'It is I Leqlerc' Leqlerc (Jack Haig) who helps Michelle getting the messages to René. He always has the stupidest disguises to fool the nazi's. Or as René once said it so truly : 'Leqlerc, the man with a thousand faces and they're all the same.' And last but definitely not least there is officer 'Good moaning' Crabtree (Arthur Bostrom), or as Yvette once said: 'That British agent who thinks he speaks our language.' He too is a message-bringing helper from Michelle.\n\nOverall viewed René is in a tight spot with dumb plans, evil enemies, a wife he cheats which she may not find out, naturally, a painting in a sausage, dumb helpers and a nazi who fancies him. In an other film or series this all could be ingredients for a very dramatic story, but not in 'Allo 'Allo, where everything is idiotic or at least odd.\n\nFor instance, in the series there is a big difference between English with a French accent (this is spoken by René, Edith and the waitresses and all the other French people) and English spoken with a British accent (spoken by the Fairfax and Carstairs). So when the two airman want to say something to for instance René they don't understand each other, even though they are all speaking English for the public understands. This might look very unfunny, but it's actually quite good and always good for a little smile.\n\nAlso the whole storyline about the painting in a sausage provides a lot of funny (sometimes to predictable, but always enthusiast played) scenes. This also counts for the scenes between Gruber and René, always played with passion by Guy Siner and a kind of caution by Gordon Kaye. A little bit overacted, but that is in the whole series, that's one of the reasons it's such delight to watch, I think."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24724,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"genre":["Comedy","History","War"],"datePublished":"1982-12-30","keywords":"accent,nazi,satire,slapstick comedy,british comedy","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443313/","name":"Gorden Kaye"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798819/","name":"Carmen Silvera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0585053/","name":"Vicki Michelle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0188462/","name":"David Croft"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0516027/","name":"Jeremy Lloyd"}]}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He owns a cafe, Café René, and his life is going as usual: He cheats his wife Edith (Carmen Silvera) with his two waitresses Yvette and Maria (Vicky Michelle and Francesca Gonshaw) and business goes as usual. The life of Frenchman René is going like he wants it to go, nice and steady. Nothing should change. But one detail will foil this from happening: The second World War. (Or as it is said brilliantly in the series more than once 'There is a war on, you know.') Before he knows what has happened René Artois is hiding two British airman, Fairfax and Carstairs (John D. Collins and Nicolas Frankau) from the nazi's, is he the helper of the French resistant, he has to stay friends with the Germans (they are good for business and for staying alive) and avoid interfering with the Gestapo while he's breaking almost all of the nazi rules and his life is totally disturbed. In the very first episode of the series this is all shown. For the fans of  ''Allo 'Allo' this first episode is a must-see. \n\nFrom now on René has got to do the most crazy, stupid, embarrassing and funny things to try to get the airman back to Britain, with the help of Michelle ''Listen very careful, I will say this only once'' of the resistance (Kirsten Cooke) who always comes up with a plan to avoid the Nazi's in the attempt to get the airman back home. Of course these plans always fail to happen on the most strange and remarkable ways, what keeps Fairfax and Carstairs at 'Café René' in the most miraculous and dumb hiding places. \n\nLuckily the Nazi's aren't the smartest and hardest people in the town of Nouvion. Colonel Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and his assistant Captain Hans Geering (Sam Kelly, later replaced by Captain Alberto Bertorelli, played by Gavin Richards), for instance, never seem to see Michelle of the resistance when she comes in the café 'nondescript', probably 'cause they're to busy having a good time whit waitresses Yvette and Maria (and later on in the series when Maria is gone little Mimi, played by Sue Hodge). Luckily for René he is in a plot with the colonel and the captain about the painting 'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp. The men want to sell it after the war instead of giving it to Hitler and René has to hide the painting in his sausages. So, the colonel and the captain need René.\n\nOne of the other nazi's in the little town is Lieutenant Herbert Gruber (Guy Siner).The reason René and his wife and waitresses don't get caught by him is because he fancies René. That's why Gruber is always willing to lend a hand (or more) to help out the café owner. Needless to say the situation between René and Lieutenant Gruber creates a lot of memorable funny scenes, for instance when René, who's always nervous with Gruber around, is dressed like a woman (all part of a plan from Michelle to get the airman back to Britain) and the Lieutenant comes in the café, or when René had just got back from a hospital (again because of a plan from Michelle) late at night and has only a hospital nighty on, one without a back and the lieutenant enters the café. Von Strohm, Geering and Gruber aren't such a problem for the café owner, but the Gestapo on the other hand is something timid René Artois fears even more than he fears his wife Edith finding out about his affairs with the waitresses. Not without reason; Herr Flick (Richard Gibson, in the last season played by David Janson) and his little helper Von Smallhousen (John Louise Mansi) are working all the time to rule out the resistance in Nouvion with René as the prime suspect. They also have a female assistant 'a woman of the opposite sex' named Private Helga Geerhard (Kim Hartman), but what Flick and Von Smallhousen don't know is that she double-crosses the two Gestapo-officers. She helps the colonel and the captain because she knows about their plan with the painting and also wants a part of the money from the 'Fallen Madonna with the big boobies' by Van Klomp. Besides enemy's René also has a lot of friends who are also against the nazi's. The already mentioned Michelle and the two airmen, but there are more: For Instance there is the undertaker Monsieur Alphonse (Kenneth Connor) who fancies Madame Edith but has to much admiration for the brave resistance hero René Artois to take her away from him, Monsieur 'It is I Leqlerc' Leqlerc (Jack Haig) who helps Michelle getting the messages to René. He always has the stupidest disguises to fool the nazi's. Or as René once said it so truly : 'Leqlerc, the man with a thousand faces and they're all the same.' And last but definitely not least there is officer 'Good moaning' Crabtree (Arthur Bostrom), or as Yvette once said: 'That British agent who thinks he speaks our language.' He too is a message-bringing helper from Michelle.\n\nOverall viewed René is in a tight spot with dumb plans, evil enemies, a wife he cheats which she may not find out, naturally, a painting in a sausage, dumb helpers and a nazi who fancies him. In an other film or series this all could be ingredients for a very dramatic story, but not in 'Allo 'Allo, where everything is idiotic or at least odd.\n\nFor instance, in the series there is a big difference between English with a French accent (this is spoken by René, Edith and the waitresses and all the other French people) and English spoken with a British accent (spoken by the Fairfax and Carstairs). So when the two airman want to say something to for instance René they don't understand each other, even though they are all speaking English for the public understands. This might look very unfunny, but it's actually quite good and always good for a little smile.\n\nAlso the whole storyline about the painting in a sausage provides a lot of funny (sometimes to predictable, but always enthusiast played) scenes. This also counts for the scenes between Gruber and René, always played with passion by Guy Siner and a kind of caution by Gordon Kaye. A little bit overacted, but that is in the whole series, that's one of the reasons it's such delight to watch, I think.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24724,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"genre":["Comedy","History","War"],"datePublished":"1982-12-30","keywords":"accent,nazi,satire,slapstick comedy,british comedy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443313/","name":"Gorden Kaye","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798819/","name":"Carmen Silvera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0585053/","name":"Vicki Michelle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0188462/","name":"David Croft","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0516027/","name":"Jeremy Lloyd"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Crowe, Connelly, Winstone Hopkins and Watson were top notch. The son's of Noah were too young – Logan Lerman from the Percy movie is miscast here and Douglas Booth as Shem was baffling. With all the liberties Aronofsky was taking I was rooting for them to die in the movie.\n\nGood special effects were the saving grace of this movie and overall the movie is over-rated. If you haven't watched it, then save your time for something else.\n\nRating: 4 on 10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":250595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-26","keywords":"old testament,supernatural power,family relationships,father son conflict,dysfunctional family","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi225552921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the Biblical story, a man suffering visions of an apocalyptic deluge takes measures to protect his family a coming flood.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062935/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359504/","name":"Ari Handel"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They make their way around the city in order to find their friend before his wedding.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1119646/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"MovieAddict2016"},"dateCreated":"2009-06-07","inLanguage":"English","name":"Genuinely funnier than any comedy in recent memory","reviewBody":"Most great comedies are based on fundamental truths -- we find a deal of humour in the illumination of our own human tragedy. Office Space is funny, for example, because we've all worked that type of job, put up with that type of boss, and suffered that type of monotonous everyday boredom.\n\nTodd Phillips' new movie, The Hangover, is as aptly titled as anything else released this year: it's about a Vegas bachelor party gone horribly awry, in which the groom inexplicably disappears, no one can remember a damned thing, and Mike Tyson wants his tiger back.\n\nYes, we've all had those nights, though perhaps not to such extremes (that's where the exaggeration of comedy serves us). The Hangover is funny because it takes this cultural ritual -- an American tradition; something almost all of us can relate to -- and finds genuine humour in the pain of its aftermath.\n\nI concede that bachelor party movies are not in short supply; the genre (if it is, indeed, a genre) should have probably both begun and ended with the Tom Hanks flick almost three decades ago. But The Hangover wisely studies the day after rather than the day itself; this is funnier because the plot works backwards, without tacky flashbacks, and much of the evening in question is left to our imagination.\n\nWhile it would be misleading to claim this is a brilliant film (in either regard – as comedy or character study), it's an assured picture that finds its footing immediately and achieves a surprising level of sustenance throughout its running time. And frankly, let's be honest, this is a breath of fresh air: it's one of the best R-rated comedies of the decade, and certainly the most uproarious since Superbad was released two years ago. Most R-rated comedies produced today are defiant; the R-rating has become a hindrance to film studios' sensibilities – everything is PG-13, saving the shameless Unrated schpeel for the DVD cut. The occasional theatrically-released R-rated comedy, as such, is infrequently modest; the ads stress the rating to remind us what we've been missing. For every legitimate offer, such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we're treated to movies like College that attempt to lure us into theaters based on the promise of raunchy decadence. The problem is that it's all so coldly calculated; these films are not funny because a majority of the time they are simply lazy and dishonest.\n\nThe simplest reason for The Hangover's success in being genuinely funny is the fact that it achieves a rare balance of character and vulgarity. We laugh at the characters' misfortunes because we like them, we empathize with them, and they are distinctly actualized. Are they stereotypical? To a certain degree, sure: we have the repressed pussy-whipped guy who obeys his girlfriend's every command (Ed Helms); the weird John Belushi-esquire figure who speaks in non sequiturs and naïve absurdities (Zach Galifianakis); and the womanizer whose confidence renders him automatic leader of the group (Bradley Cooper). It's a testament to the strengths of these actors that they make their characters endearing and believable, even in the face of total lunacy.\n\nHelms has been an underrated highlight of the American Office for the past several years, never quite earning the praise he deserves. His character on the show is played with pitch-perfect perversity: he's not overtly creepy (like the program's other weirdo, Creed), but rather subtly unnerving. Helms invests a great deal of nuance into what is ostensibly a throwaway, supporting goofball; this movie, if nothing else, will justly reveal his talents.\n\nCooper uses his looks to his advantage: it's funny to watch handsome people exploit their securities. Cooper essentially turns your typical Leading Man figure into a bumbling idiot, self-absorbed and clueless. It's effective, he's got great chemistry with the other guys, and it's fun to watch such an immoral and ruthless character take center stage in a mainstream comedy.\n\nGalifianakis, a cult comedian who I've admired for years, has been struggling quite a while. Not many people other than myself and Sean Penn saw his 2001 comedy Out Cold, probably because it wasn't all that great; but he was easily the most amusing aspect of the picture. He once described himself as being gifted by the opposite of the Midas touch, with more than a few canceled TV shows to his credit (including Comedy Central's unheralded Dog Bites Man), but it seems his persistence has finally paid off: he has discovered, at last, a movie of strong enough quality to reflect his talents. Galifianakis has a fair share of the film's funniest dialogue; as far as fat funny guys go, many of them (such as Chris Farley) made the ill-fated mistake of playing dumb in a sharp fashion: hurtful quips and silly one-liners, all self-aware. Galifianakis plays his character straight and the laughs are subsequently heartier; when he embraces his brother-in-law while nude, the act seems innocently awkward rather than deliberately awkward, and that's what makes it so funny. He's described in The Hangover, by another character, as a child with a beard. Imagine how funny it is when he names a Caucasian baby Carlos, without any shred of condescension or knowing humour.\n\nThe Hangover is surely destined to become the sleeper comedy hit of 2009, and, more likely, a cult flick in the years to come. It's more deserving of such acknowledgment than many recent successes, and while we may live in an era saturated with unnecessary sequels, I actually left The Hangover hoping to see these guys again. And that's a rare feeling these days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":751226,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-07-29","keywords":"hangover,female nudity,bachelor party,implied cunnilingus,fellatio","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Hangover","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2650997529","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNjI1ODAwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMzNDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNjI1ODAwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMzNDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Las Vegas, three groomsmen lose their about-to-be-wed buddy during their drunken misadventures, forcing them to retrace their steps in order to find him before the church bells ring."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0302108/","name":"Zach Galifianakis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058581/","name":"Justin Bartha"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680846/","name":"Todd Phillips"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221959/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524190/","name":"Jon Lucas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601859/","name":"Scott Moore"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some are really funny, like the robot battle outside the Louvren, and the Italian pervert smoking a post-sex cigarette. Matt Damon turns up somewhat unexpectedly in the USA and sings the catchy "Scotty doesn't know" song.\n\nAll in all, this is a great comedy to watch with your friends, and even better in international company.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":204959,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-02-20","keywords":"incestuous kiss,nudist,nudity,sex in a confessional,oral sex","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"EuroTrip","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2946826521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NjM2IwNGMtZTIzYS00NWIxLWI3NTEtZjc4ZmM4NTcxMzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NjM2IwNGMtZTIzYS00NWIxLWI3NTEtZjc4ZmM4NTcxMzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for EuroTrip","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1310709/","name":"Scott Mechlowicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0686009/","name":"Jacob Pitts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005502/","name":"Michelle Trachtenberg"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0769840/","name":"Jeff Schaffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0073688/","name":"Alec Berg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0541635/","name":"David Mandel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098163/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0073688/","name":"Alec Berg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0541635/","name":"David Mandel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0769840/","name":"Jeff Schaffer"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He owns a cafe, Café René, and his life is going as usual: He cheats his wife Edith (Carmen Silvera) with his two waitresses Yvette and Maria (Vicky Michelle and Francesca Gonshaw) and business goes as usual. The life of Frenchman René is going like he wants it to go, nice and steady. Nothing should change. But one detail will foil this from happening: The second World War. (Or as it is said brilliantly in the series more than once 'There is a war on, you know.') Before he knows what has happened René Artois is hiding two British airman, Fairfax and Carstairs (John D. Collins and Nicolas Frankau) from the nazi's, is he the helper of the French resistant, he has to stay friends with the Germans (they are good for business and for staying alive) and avoid interfering with the Gestapo while he's breaking almost all of the nazi rules and his life is totally disturbed. In the very first episode of the series this is all shown. For the fans of  ''Allo 'Allo' this first episode is a must-see. \n\nFrom now on René has got to do the most crazy, stupid, embarrassing and funny things to try to get the airman back to Britain, with the help of Michelle ''Listen very careful, I will say this only once'' of the resistance (Kirsten Cooke) who always comes up with a plan to avoid the Nazi's in the attempt to get the airman back home. Of course these plans always fail to happen on the most strange and remarkable ways, what keeps Fairfax and Carstairs at 'Café René' in the most miraculous and dumb hiding places. \n\nLuckily the Nazi's aren't the smartest and hardest people in the town of Nouvion. Colonel Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and his assistant Captain Hans Geering (Sam Kelly, later replaced by Captain Alberto Bertorelli, played by Gavin Richards), for instance, never seem to see Michelle of the resistance when she comes in the café 'nondescript', probably 'cause they're to busy having a good time whit waitresses Yvette and Maria (and later on in the series when Maria is gone little Mimi, played by Sue Hodge). Luckily for René he is in a plot with the colonel and the captain about the painting 'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp. The men want to sell it after the war instead of giving it to Hitler and René has to hide the painting in his sausages. So, the colonel and the captain need René.\n\nOne of the other nazi's in the little town is Lieutenant Herbert Gruber (Guy Siner).The reason René and his wife and waitresses don't get caught by him is because he fancies René. That's why Gruber is always willing to lend a hand (or more) to help out the café owner. Needless to say the situation between René and Lieutenant Gruber creates a lot of memorable funny scenes, for instance when René, who's always nervous with Gruber around, is dressed like a woman (all part of a plan from Michelle to get the airman back to Britain) and the Lieutenant comes in the café, or when René had just got back from a hospital (again because of a plan from Michelle) late at night and has only a hospital nighty on, one without a back and the lieutenant enters the café. Von Strohm, Geering and Gruber aren't such a problem for the café owner, but the Gestapo on the other hand is something timid René Artois fears even more than he fears his wife Edith finding out about his affairs with the waitresses. Not without reason; Herr Flick (Richard Gibson, in the last season played by David Janson) and his little helper Von Smallhousen (John Louise Mansi) are working all the time to rule out the resistance in Nouvion with René as the prime suspect. They also have a female assistant 'a woman of the opposite sex' named Private Helga Geerhard (Kim Hartman), but what Flick and Von Smallhousen don't know is that she double-crosses the two Gestapo-officers. She helps the colonel and the captain because she knows about their plan with the painting and also wants a part of the money from the 'Fallen Madonna with the big boobies' by Van Klomp. Besides enemy's René also has a lot of friends who are also against the nazi's. The already mentioned Michelle and the two airmen, but there are more: For Instance there is the undertaker Monsieur Alphonse (Kenneth Connor) who fancies Madame Edith but has to much admiration for the brave resistance hero René Artois to take her away from him, Monsieur 'It is I Leqlerc' Leqlerc (Jack Haig) who helps Michelle getting the messages to René. He always has the stupidest disguises to fool the nazi's. Or as René once said it so truly : 'Leqlerc, the man with a thousand faces and they're all the same.' And last but definitely not least there is officer 'Good moaning' Crabtree (Arthur Bostrom), or as Yvette once said: 'That British agent who thinks he speaks our language.' He too is a message-bringing helper from Michelle.\n\nOverall viewed René is in a tight spot with dumb plans, evil enemies, a wife he cheats which she may not find out, naturally, a painting in a sausage, dumb helpers and a nazi who fancies him. In an other film or series this all could be ingredients for a very dramatic story, but not in 'Allo 'Allo, where everything is idiotic or at least odd.\n\nFor instance, in the series there is a big difference between English with a French accent (this is spoken by René, Edith and the waitresses and all the other French people) and English spoken with a British accent (spoken by the Fairfax and Carstairs). So when the two airman want to say something to for instance René they don't understand each other, even though they are all speaking English for the public understands. This might look very unfunny, but it's actually quite good and always good for a little smile.\n\nAlso the whole storyline about the painting in a sausage provides a lot of funny (sometimes to predictable, but always enthusiast played) scenes. This also counts for the scenes between Gruber and René, always played with passion by Guy Siner and a kind of caution by Gordon Kaye. A little bit overacted, but that is in the whole series, that's one of the reasons it's such delight to watch, I think."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24724,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"genre":["Comedy","History","War"],"datePublished":"1982-12-30","keywords":"accent,nazi,satire,slapstick comedy,british comedy","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443313/","name":"Gorden Kaye"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798819/","name":"Carmen Silvera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0585053/","name":"Vicki Michelle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0188462/","name":"David Croft"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0516027/","name":"Jeremy Lloyd"}]}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They also have a female assistant 'a woman of the opposite sex' named Private Helga Geerhard (Kim Hartman), but what Flick and Von Smallhousen don't know is that she double-crosses the two Gestapo-officers. She helps the colonel and the captain because she knows about their plan with the painting and also wants a part of the money from the 'Fallen Madonna with the big boobies' by Van Klomp. Besides enemy's René also has a lot of friends who are also against the nazi's. The already mentioned Michelle and the two airmen, but there are more: For Instance there is the undertaker Monsieur Alphonse (Kenneth Connor) who fancies Madame Edith but has to much admiration for the brave resistance hero René Artois to take her away from him, Monsieur 'It is I Leqlerc' Leqlerc (Jack Haig) who helps Michelle getting the messages to René. He always has the stupidest disguises to fool the nazi's. Or as René once said it so truly : 'Leqlerc, the man with a thousand faces and they're all the same.' And last but definitely not least there is officer 'Good moaning' Crabtree (Arthur Bostrom), or as Yvette once said: 'That British agent who thinks he speaks our language.' He too is a message-bringing helper from Michelle.\n\nOverall viewed René is in a tight spot with dumb plans, evil enemies, a wife he cheats which she may not find out, naturally, a painting in a sausage, dumb helpers and a nazi who fancies him. In an other film or series this all could be ingredients for a very dramatic story, but not in 'Allo 'Allo, where everything is idiotic or at least odd.\n\nFor instance, in the series there is a big difference between English with a French accent (this is spoken by René, Edith and the waitresses and all the other French people) and English spoken with a British accent (spoken by the Fairfax and Carstairs). So when the two airman want to say something to for instance René they don't understand each other, even though they are all speaking English for the public understands. This might look very unfunny, but it's actually quite good and always good for a little smile.\n\nAlso the whole storyline about the painting in a sausage provides a lot of funny (sometimes to predictable, but always enthusiast played) scenes. This also counts for the scenes between Gruber and René, always played with passion by Guy Siner and a kind of caution by Gordon Kaye. A little bit overacted, but that is in the whole series, that's one of the reasons it's such delight to watch, I think.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24724,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"genre":["Comedy","History","War"],"datePublished":"1982-12-30","keywords":"accent,nazi,satire,slapstick comedy,british comedy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443313/","name":"Gorden Kaye","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798819/","name":"Carmen Silvera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0585053/","name":"Vicki Michelle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0188462/","name":"David Croft","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0516027/","name":"Jeremy Lloyd"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unfortunately too many story-lines about the powerful royal family of vessen, the reapers, the vessen-grimm politics, and the vessen-killing military cult got introduced.

He's hellbent on returning to something called the Nexus, a domain where, once a person has been there, they apparently don't want to leave. It's just pure joy. To stop Soran, Captain Picard (the great Sir Patrick Stewart) must team with the legendary Captain Kirk (the almighty William Shatner), who supposedly perished saving the "Enterprise-B" during its maiden voyage.\n\n"Generations" initially comes off as a great gimmick, of uniting two generations of Enterprise crews, but this never really pays off, as the only two who meet are Picard and Kirk. "Generations" is NOT one of the stronger entries in this film series, with an engaging but uninspired story. The main attraction for veteran fans is likely to be the prospect of Picard and Kirk teaming up for the final half hour, engaging in fisticuffs with the maniacal Soran and hurrying to prevent him from destroying a star.\n\nThis viewer can't speak as one who has necessarily been a big Trek fan from the start, so he basically views this as pretty fun, all things considered. Certainly all the series regulars are in very fine form, with the android Data (Brent Spiner) getting the lions' share of the comedy relief, as he has inserted a special computer chip that allows him to experience emotions. This presents a problem at times, because either *everything* is amusing to him, or he gets scared easily.\n\nIt's nice to see old hands James Doohan and Walter Koenig, however briefly; Shatner brings the final part of the film to life. Not such an easy task, given the talents of Stewart (Picard has some key emotional moments) and the delicious, hammy villainy of McDowell. In addition to the regulars from the 'Next Generation' series, other familiar faces like Alan Ruck, Jacqueline Kim, Jenette Goldstein, Glenn Morshower, Tim Russ, and Brian Thompson turn up. An unbilled Whoopi Goldberg reprises her role of Guinan.\n\nWonderful music by Dennis McCarthy and some impressive visual effects by ILM help to make this a reasonably entertaining series entry.\n\nSeven out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80019,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1994-11-18","keywords":"female empath,half human half alien,empath,human alien hybrid,captain","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3961241113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU5ZGZmZWMtMjEyNi00MGEwLWFkZTUtMjVmY2UxMjA3MmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU5ZGZmZWMtMjEyNi00MGEwLWFkZTUtMjVmY2UxMjA3MmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000638/","name":"William Shatner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000532/","name":"Malcolm McDowell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141222/","name":"David Carson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

He's hellbent on returning to something called the Nexus, a domain where, once a person has been there, they apparently don't want to leave. It's just pure joy. To stop Soran, Captain Picard (the great Sir Patrick Stewart) must team with the legendary Captain Kirk (the almighty William Shatner), who supposedly perished saving the "Enterprise-B" during its maiden voyage.\n\n"Generations" initially comes off as a great gimmick, of uniting two generations of Enterprise crews, but this never really pays off, as the only two who meet are Picard and Kirk. "Generations" is NOT one of the stronger entries in this film series, with an engaging but uninspired story.

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series.

He's hellbent on returning to something called the Nexus, a domain where, once a person has been there, they apparently don't want to leave. It's just pure joy. To stop Soran, Captain Picard (the great Sir Patrick Stewart) must team with the legendary Captain Kirk (the almighty William Shatner), who supposedly perished saving the "Enterprise-B" during its maiden voyage.\n\n"Generations" initially comes off as a great gimmick, of uniting two generations of Enterprise crews, but this never really pays off, as the only two who meet are Picard and Kirk. "Generations" is NOT one of the stronger entries in this film series, with an engaging but uninspired story. The main attraction for veteran fans is likely to be the prospect of Picard and Kirk teaming up for the final half hour, engaging in fisticuffs with the maniacal Soran and hurrying to prevent him from destroying a star.\n\nThis viewer can't speak as one who has necessarily been a big Trek fan from the start, so he basically views this as pretty fun, all things considered. Certainly all the series regulars are in very fine form, with the android Data (Brent Spiner) getting the lions' share of the comedy relief, as he has inserted a special computer chip that allows him to experience emotions. This presents a problem at times, because either *everything* is amusing to him, or he gets scared easily.\n\nIt's nice to see old hands James Doohan and Walter Koenig, however briefly; Shatner brings the final part of the film to life. Not such an easy task, given the talents of Stewart (Picard has some key emotional moments) and the delicious, hammy villainy of McDowell. In addition to the regulars from the 'Next Generation' series, other familiar faces like Alan Ruck, Jacqueline Kim, Jenette Goldstein, Glenn Morshower, Tim Russ, and Brian Thompson turn up. An unbilled Whoopi Goldberg reprises her role of Guinan.\n\nWonderful music by Dennis McCarthy and some impressive visual effects by ILM help to make this a reasonably entertaining series entry.\n\nSeven out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80019,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1994-11-18","keywords":"female empath,half human half alien,empath,human alien hybrid,captain","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3961241113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU5ZGZmZWMtMjEyNi00MGEwLWFkZTUtMjVmY2UxMjA3MmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU5ZGZmZWMtMjEyNi00MGEwLWFkZTUtMjVmY2UxMjA3MmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000638/","name":"William Shatner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000532/","name":"Malcolm McDowell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141222/","name":"David Carson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

I remember the story which was great - different from the film though. And this film had excellent directing. It was very old and sound wasn't the best. I have the DVD that I imported from Poland and it doesn't have subtitles so I was disappointed. If you understand Polish and you don't mind low budget films, than this may be for you. The DVD had no special features and was kinda disappointing. It was not in Widescreen, but the quality was watchable. The film itself looked boring.
