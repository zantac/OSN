A cruel joke. Terrible consequences. And nothing more. The only sin - it is a portrait with status of sketch. Correct in large traits but keeping the viewer out of the story.

But, no doubts, Tifanny Dopke gives a beautiful performance."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":588,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)\n\nDespite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?\n\nI think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)\n\nI read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no 'it could really happen!' here.\n\nSo after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":401198,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)\n\nDespite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?\n\nI think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)\n\nI read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no 'it could really happen!' here.\n\nSo after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":401198,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Deseta sezona staroj ekipi donosi u život nove ljude poput djeteta Howarda i Bernadette, ali ljubavni problemi svih genijalaca su i dalje prisutni. U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.\n\nThough the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn't have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. \n\nI commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just "based" on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting, well-done film, and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.\n\nTen stars!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":372746,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.\n\nThough the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn't have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. \n\nI commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just "based" on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting, well-done film, and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.\n\nTen stars!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":372746,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like "The Rock," he's a big, muscular macho guy who men can look upon with some respect and the ladies can fall for. Unfortunately, a number of these testosterone-filled action films, including this one, are somewhat moronic in nature. However, they are undeniably entertaining.\n\nYou can always depend on one thing in these type of movies, from the "biker movies" of the '50s to today's films: the hero will always be a rebel against authority and any laws of the land. Also, an even more-recent theme is to have the government actually employ the rebel to get the job done because their men are unable to accomplish what this ultra-tattooed macho man can do! It's so much garbage, but it has its moments and Diesel still is a likable hero of sorts. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger before him, and Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris and then "The Rock," these kind of muscle-men have fairly clean mouths and at least some ideals. \n\nFor pure action, the movie succeeds because, in the end, it does entertain which is the name of the game.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174572,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like "The Rock," he's a big, muscular macho guy who men can look upon with some respect and the ladies can fall for. Unfortunately, a number of these testosterone-filled action films, including this one, are somewhat moronic in nature. However, they are undeniably entertaining.\n\nYou can always depend on one thing in these type of movies, from the "biker movies" of the '50s to today's films: the hero will always be a rebel against authority and any laws of the land. Also, an even more-recent theme is to have the government actually employ the rebel to get the job done because their men are unable to accomplish what this ultra-tattooed macho man can do! It's so much garbage, but it has its moments and Diesel still is a likable hero of sorts. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger before him, and Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris and then "The Rock," these kind of muscle-men have fairly clean mouths and at least some ideals. \n\nFor pure action, the movie succeeds because, in the end, it does entertain which is the name of the game.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174572,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And I wasn't surprised when I discovered that Sniper had its own set of sequels. Thankfully, for this franchise, just because they are Direct-to-Video sequels doesn't mean the writers left out what happened from the first film. Sniper 2 does retain some good qualities but it lacks a lot of what made Sniper (1993) the best.\n\nTom Berenger is back as the intelligent and deadly marksmen, Thomas Beckett. After having a frustrating retired life, he's persuaded to take on another mission by the U.S. government. This time, it's to take out a leader named Valstoria in Europe. It's great to see Berenger playing Beckett again because who else could? Berenger has a way of making his character cool and smart at the same time. Accompanying Beckett is Cole played by Bokeem Woodbine. Woodbine's character is arrogant and by listening to him talk rudely to Beckett just didn't seem like a good match. Zane's character, Richard Miller. was arrogant too but in a different manner; he had no experience being a sniper.\n\nSomething that really throws this film off track is the location. The first Sniper film took place in Panama. Dense heavy jungle, where every bit of the soldier had to be covered in camouflage. The location here is the middle of a city. There's no room for this now. Making things even more off beat is how this sequel turned itself into an actioneer film. There's absolutely no hint of thriller genre in the running time. As Beckett said originally from the first film:\n\n"We'll wait days, for one shot one kill."\n\nThere's no extended waiting time here. It's "On your mark, get set, go". Several cars blow up, multiple gunfights, and lots of explosions. Sure it's a different angle but there's nothing to be thrilled about anymore. The explosions do the job. All the audience has to do now is leave their brains at the door. Why make such a successful first film and then turn it into a brain-dead action franchise? Thriller films engage their audiences, but not like this. I did enjoy it to a certain extent but I wasn't enthralled by it.\n\nThen there's the whole issue of Beckett not understanding what the Europeans are speaking. How come he doesn't know? Beckett's the smart one! Why does he have to play Zane's role in this film and be the one who's always behind the eight ball? It's almost like he took a back seat for this film. One thing that made me a bit happy was knowing that Gary Chang was back again to make the score to this sequel. It wasn't totally the same as before but it at least tried to recall the elements of the first movie to show its resemblance.\n\nSniper 2 is not the best sequel even with Tom Berenger and Gary Chang reprising their roles. The story is at least faithful to the first film but nothing else is truly memorable about it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And in many aspects this is better than 2012, Volcano, or other movies like these. For starters, there is an actual plot to the movie before the volcano erupts. \n\nOther things I liked:\n\n\n* The gladiatorial theme is well presented. You can see people who hate being a gladiator, people who are just waiting for their freedom, people who believe they are gods in the arena, and so on, and you can watch how the majority of Romans loved these shows, but some didn't. You can make yourself an idea of the weather of that theme.\n\n\n\n* The romance is believable. I mean, it happens very fast, but it's not Disney's "Real Love" They are just two people who LIKE each other caught in the massive chaos of a volcano, not much more. \n\n\n\n* the special effects are plain awesome! Not only the gigantic explosion and lava bombs, and tsunamis. Also the small things, like the views of the city in the background, and the aerial shots.\n\n\n\n* The city was amazing. People complain "Pompeii is not a port city" Well, actually it WAS, but the eruption changed the shape of the coastline. And the fact that THAT city shown in the movie WAS Pompeii. They actually shoot in place and then recreated the city out of the remainings using CGI. So the grid shape, the walls and everything is in place just as it was 2000 years ago. Archaeologists have in fact praised the director for his recreation of the city\n\n\n\n* the volcano. It's the star of the movie without a doubt. It seems to have almost a personality. The way the eruption happened was very close to what actually happened. Some artistic liberties were made for the sake of entertaining. You won't be seeing any clichéd lava river because Mount Vesubius doesn't work that way.\n\n\n\n* The ending. It was amazing. I can't spoil it for you, but making it in any other way would have damaged the quality of the film.\n\n\n\n* The acting. It was really good for what I was expecting. Milo surprised me a lot, because I could really believe him as a lead man. The girl also. She seemed so plain in photos, but once the movie started I could say she nailed the part perfectly and was by no means just "miss fanservice", as girls in these kinds of movies tend to be. The real surprise was Atticus. The actor totally stealed the movie for himself in every scene, something that was perfect for an invicted champion in the peak of his gladiatorial career.\n\n\nWhat didn't I like? The fact that the other famous city in the vicinity of Vesubius(Herculaeum, I think it's called) wasn't showed in the aerial shots. I mean, obviously the movie would be to complicated if we include it in the plot, but an aerial cameo of this other city would have been a fine addition to the movie, and would have improved the accuracy of it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":107484,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Very strange choices for the voice-acting. Mish mash of songs that had little or no connection to the scenes you hear them in. Animation was OK but some direct copying of Finding Nemo. I had zero connection to any of the characters and they really weren't memorable.

And in many aspects this is better than 2012, Volcano, or other movies like these. For starters, there is an actual plot to the movie before the volcano erupts. \n\nOther things I liked:\n\n\n* The gladiatorial theme is well presented. You can see people who hate being a gladiator, people who are just waiting for their freedom, people who believe they are gods in the arena, and so on, and you can watch how the majority of Romans loved these shows, but some didn't. You can make yourself an idea of the weather of that theme.\n\n\n\n* The romance is believable. I mean, it happens very fast, but it's not Disney's "Real Love" They are just two people who LIKE each other caught in the massive chaos of a volcano, not much more. \n\n\n\n* the special effects are plain awesome! Not only the gigantic explosion and lava bombs, and tsunamis. Also the small things, like the views of the city in the background, and the aerial shots.\n\n\n\n* The city was amazing. People complain "Pompeii is not a port city" Well, actually it WAS, but the eruption changed the shape of the coastline. And the fact that THAT city shown in the movie WAS Pompeii. They actually shoot in place and then recreated the city out of the remainings using CGI. So the grid shape, the walls and everything is in place just as it was 2000 years ago. Archaeologists have in fact praised the director for his recreation of the city\n\n\n\n* the volcano. It's the star of the movie without a doubt. It seems to have almost a personality. The way the eruption happened was very close to what actually happened. Some artistic liberties were made for the sake of entertaining. You won't be seeing any clichéd lava river because Mount Vesubius doesn't work that way.\n\n\n\n* The ending. It was amazing. I can't spoil it for you, but making it in any other way would have damaged the quality of the film.\n\n\n\n* The acting. It was really good for what I was expecting. Milo surprised me a lot, because I could really believe him as a lead man. The girl also. She seemed so plain in photos, but once the movie started I could say she nailed the part perfectly and was by no means just "miss fanservice", as girls in these kinds of movies tend to be. The real surprise was Atticus. The actor totally stealed the movie for himself in every scene, something that was perfect for an invicted champion in the peak of his gladiatorial career.\n\n\nWhat didn't I like? The fact that the other famous city in the vicinity of Vesubius(Herculaeum, I think it's called) wasn't showed in the aerial shots. I mean, obviously the movie would be to complicated if we include it in the plot, but an aerial cameo of this other city would have been a fine addition to the movie, and would have improved the accuracy of it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":107484,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And in many aspects this is better than 2012, Volcano, or other movies like these. For starters, there is an actual plot to the movie before the volcano erupts. \n\nOther things I liked:\n\n\n* The gladiatorial theme is well presented. You can see people who hate being a gladiator, people who are just waiting for their freedom, people who believe they are gods in the arena, and so on, and you can watch how the majority of Romans loved these shows, but some didn't. You can make yourself an idea of the weather of that theme.\n\n\n\n* The romance is believable. I mean, it happens very fast, but it's not Disney's "Real Love" They are just two people who LIKE each other caught in the massive chaos of a volcano, not much more. \n\n\n\n* the special effects are plain awesome! Not only the gigantic explosion and lava bombs, and tsunamis. Also the small things, like the views of the city in the background, and the aerial shots.\n\n\n\n* The city was amazing. People complain "Pompeii is not a port city" Well, actually it WAS, but the eruption changed the shape of the coastline. And the fact that THAT city shown in the movie WAS Pompeii. They actually shoot in place and then recreated the city out of the remainings using CGI. So the grid shape, the walls and everything is in place just as it was 2000 years ago. Archaeologists have in fact praised the director for his recreation of the city\n\n\n\n* the volcano. It's the star of the movie without a doubt. It seems to have almost a personality. The way the eruption happened was very close to what actually happened. Some artistic liberties were made for the sake of entertaining. You won't be seeing any clichéd lava river because Mount Vesubius doesn't work that way.\n\n\n\n* The ending. It was amazing. I can't spoil it for you, but making it in any other way would have damaged the quality of the film.\n\n\n\n* The acting. It was really good for what I was expecting. Milo surprised me a lot, because I could really believe him as a lead man. The girl also. She seemed so plain in photos, but once the movie started I could say she nailed the part perfectly and was by no means just "miss fanservice", as girls in these kinds of movies tend to be. The real surprise was Atticus. The actor totally stealed the movie for himself in every scene, something that was perfect for an invicted champion in the peak of his gladiatorial career.\n\n\nWhat didn't I like? The fact that the other famous city in the vicinity of Vesubius(Herculaeum, I think it's called) wasn't showed in the aerial shots. I mean, obviously the movie would be to complicated if we include it in the plot, but an aerial cameo of this other city would have been a fine addition to the movie, and would have improved the accuracy of it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":107484,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The youngest cast member of the movie was promising actor Karl urban, his tux made him move like 007 &amp; he gave an utmost completion to the RED team, the best thing about Karl urban was that he brought freshness to the movie. Brian Cox, Julian McMohan and Richard Dreyfuss were good. Overall it's a fun ride which no one should miss on any chance. Watch it in first moment!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":293813,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As Campbell and his college girlfriend Kate (Tea Leoni) say farewell, Kate begs him to stay, but Jack gets on his plane anyway. Their relationship ends while he is in London and Jack goes on to become the President of a large Wall Street company. While walking home from work on Christmas Eve thirteen years later, Campbell has an encounter with an angel, who gives him a "glimpse." This "glimpse" shows Jack what his life would be like if he and Kate were still together, and, in the end, Jack must choose between his life of riches and loneliness, or a life filled with family and love.\n\nThe central idea of the film is to show that a person who is rich in material objects often lacks more important things. It says that these things include being surrounded by people who care about you and having someone to love. Before Campbell's "glimpse," his only motivation is money and most of the movie is filmed at his office, showing he does not have much of a life outside of it. Without a second thought, he calls an emergency meeting with his staff at noon on Christmas, causing them to leave their families and come in to the office. The movie successfully shows the struggle between money and family because this is a theme to which the audience can relate.\n\nThe director is able to keep the audience's attention throughout the movie through the use of humor. Lassiter (Josef Sommer), the owner of the company, when asked why he is still at the office on Christmas Eve replies "because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money." In doing this, the director, while still concentrating on the theme of the movie, keeps the viewer watching. In doing these things and more, the director creates a film that is not only entertaining to watch, but also one that carries a message about life and happiness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A low-budget PG-13 adaptation of 300-style movies made in Bulgaria, this movie is in line with the expectations on what Renny Harlin is capable of.\n\nWhile not being a disaster on a whole, it's a disaster in parts. The special effects, while being descent 3D images at times, are badly connected with live shots. There are many moments when perspective of such sequences is distorted in really obvious (and unintentionally funny) ways. There are numerous anachronisms. Characters use costumes and jewelry that could not be available in ancient Greece. Screenplay, while not being completely absurd, has some rather awkward dialog lines and unexplainable plot moments.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie is not a Hercules legend but rather a shallow love story and family drama. There's even a bathing scene in a romantic- looking pond with flowers under a waterfall (the water in the pond is so dirty though that one can only feel pity for the actors). There are no heroic deeds of Hercules depicted in this movie.\n\nOne last blow for Hercules is PG-13 rating. There's no blood at all. When swords pierce bodies, they re-appear absolutely clean. When one of the characters was struck in the neck, the next shot showed his neck without a sign of a would or even a drop of blood. One of the few things the movie managed to deliver were some dynamic battle sequences; but PG- 13 made them look fake. In the age of 300 and Spartacus TV show, this is not something you want to waste your time on.\n\nUnless you wish to add to a surprising $8 mln box office success after its first weekend, which will probably make this movie more profitable than most other current releases.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52985,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A low-budget PG-13 adaptation of 300-style movies made in Bulgaria, this movie is in line with the expectations on what Renny Harlin is capable of.\n\nWhile not being a disaster on a whole, it's a disaster in parts. The special effects, while being descent 3D images at times, are badly connected with live shots. There are many moments when perspective of such sequences is distorted in really obvious (and unintentionally funny) ways. There are numerous anachronisms. Characters use costumes and jewelry that could not be available in ancient Greece. Screenplay, while not being completely absurd, has some rather awkward dialog lines and unexplainable plot moments.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie is not a Hercules legend but rather a shallow love story and family drama. There's even a bathing scene in a romantic- looking pond with flowers under a waterfall (the water in the pond is so dirty though that one can only feel pity for the actors). There are no heroic deeds of Hercules depicted in this movie.\n\nOne last blow for Hercules is PG-13 rating. There's no blood at all. When swords pierce bodies, they re-appear absolutely clean. When one of the characters was struck in the neck, the next shot showed his neck without a sign of a would or even a drop of blood. One of the few things the movie managed to deliver were some dynamic battle sequences; but PG- 13 made them look fake. In the age of 300 and Spartacus TV show, this is not something you want to waste your time on.\n\nUnless you wish to add to a surprising $8 mln box office success after its first weekend, which will probably make this movie more profitable than most other current releases.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52985,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And I wasn't surprised when I discovered that Sniper had its own set of sequels. Thankfully, for this franchise, just because they are Direct-to-Video sequels doesn't mean the writers left out what happened from the first film. Sniper 2 does retain some good qualities but it lacks a lot of what made Sniper (1993) the best.\n\nTom Berenger is back as the intelligent and deadly marksmen, Thomas Beckett. After having a frustrating retired life, he's persuaded to take on another mission by the U.S. government. This time, it's to take out a leader named Valstoria in Europe. It's great to see Berenger playing Beckett again because who else could? Berenger has a way of making his character cool and smart at the same time. Accompanying Beckett is Cole played by Bokeem Woodbine. Woodbine's character is arrogant and by listening to him talk rudely to Beckett just didn't seem like a good match. Zane's character, Richard Miller. was arrogant too but in a different manner; he had no experience being a sniper.\n\nSomething that really throws this film off track is the location. The first Sniper film took place in Panama. Dense heavy jungle, where every bit of the soldier had to be covered in camouflage. The location here is the middle of a city. There's no room for this now. Making things even more off beat is how this sequel turned itself into an actioneer film. There's absolutely no hint of thriller genre in the running time. As Beckett said originally from the first film:\n\n"We'll wait days, for one shot one kill."\n\nThere's no extended waiting time here. It's "On your mark, get set, go". Several cars blow up, multiple gunfights, and lots of explosions. Sure it's a different angle but there's nothing to be thrilled about anymore. The explosions do the job. All the audience has to do now is leave their brains at the door. Why make such a successful first film and then turn it into a brain-dead action franchise? Thriller films engage their audiences, but not like this. I did enjoy it to a certain extent but I wasn't enthralled by it.\n\nThen there's the whole issue of Beckett not understanding what the Europeans are speaking. How come he doesn't know? Beckett's the smart one! Why does he have to play Zane's role in this film and be the one who's always behind the eight ball? It's almost like he took a back seat for this film. One thing that made me a bit happy was knowing that Gary Chang was back again to make the score to this sequel. It wasn't totally the same as before but it at least tried to recall the elements of the first movie to show its resemblance.\n\nSniper 2 is not the best sequel even with Tom Berenger and Gary Chang reprising their roles. The story is at least faithful to the first film but nothing else is truly memorable about it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?\n\nSummary\n\nBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name "Baby" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is. \n\nReview\n\nPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level. We then proceed to a long tracking shot of Baby navigating to a coffee shop, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful shots of 2017. I never thought Watching someone get coffee would be this entertaining. Wright does a good job from the start of putting us into this kids world while simultaneously showing us why he doesn't belong in it. The casting choices were all good and added different elements to the story. Baby was the only one tied to music physically through his iPod, but each character was choreographed as if they were listening too. The action was shot really well especially the getaway scenes, both on foot and in the car. The car chase scenes are pure brilliance making The Fast and The Furious movies look 2nd tier. Edgar truly kept me engaged and I never felt cheated in any scene. \n\nCons\n\nMuch of the film focused on visuals to the point where I felt some characters were a tad bit flat. Subtracting Baby and Doc (Kevin Spacy), I felt the others could have had a little more substance. Some of their decisions and actions felt somewhat robotic in my opinion. With that being said Buddy (Hamm) and Batts (Foxx) did shine in a couple of scenes due to them being quality actors. With this being said please understand that even this didn't ruin this movie due to them still being entertaining characters. \n\nLastly the only other minor issue I had was the romance. Although there was nothing wrong with the acting or chemistry between the characters, it was just a little difficult to believe or get invested in.\n\nConclusion/Grade\n\nWhat makes Baby Driver great is that it is a unique experience and is visually stunning. Edgar Wright does a great job of blending action, suspense, romance and comedy making it one of the most enjoyable films of 2017. \n\n8.1/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":458028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Wow! Best film I've seen so far this year (although the big guns have yet to come out). The only problem with it is I can't for the life of me remember the film's name in order to tell my friends to go see it.\n\nIt's not easy writing and directing an original movie that has a new slant on a familiar topic - a tragic mass murder at a school in which the main character's son dies.

The cast, acting and script is great, I watch a lot of films right across the board and I haven't seen one in this genre that has been as successful. Those who disagree please tell me where I can find some! I'm sure the book is good too but I think you have to judge it on its own merits.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68139,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Cowboys are based on a hit theater show that was seen by well over 100.000 viewers (some say even 150.000), proving that an art experiment need not necessarily be abstract, hermetic and addressed to narrow elitist circles. However, one need not see the theater show to enjoy the movie. In fact, it might be quite refreshing to see it without preconceptions. A gloomy middle-aged theater director Sasha (Sasa Anocic) returns to his home town, even gloomier industrial province, where an old friend, the local mayor (Niksa Butijer) convinces him to put on a theater show with a group of amateurs. A group of weirdoes and bizarre looking types arrives for the audition, none of them having any acting or theater experience whatsoever, and the disillusioned director ends up taking them all. From the first shots we are aware of all the fullmonthy and other underdog clichés, but instead of seeing them as a potential flaw, surprisingly they turn out to be one of the best qualities of this movie. Considering that everything has already been said in film (and music) and it is not easy to be original, especially on such slippery ground as with popular comedy, I have to point out the work of the director and scriptwriter Tomislav Mrsic, acclaimed documentarist, who has managed to use all the character, situational and dramatic clichés in such a way that the viewer doesn't feel annoyed by the fact that they have all been seen. Which is a good feeling! The movie Cowboys is an ensemble comedy, and it's all about the roles they play – even if there were only two or three great actors, it would be a success. Mrsic was lucky in that regard, mostly thanks to the fact that he used the same cast as in the theater show. There is the dumb Domagoj (the incredible Zivko Anocic), who remains a mystery until the end: is he a complete idiot, mentally challenged, or both, or is he just pretending? Then, the friendly gypsy Miodrag (played by the equally great Rakan Rushaidat); the postman Javor, an annoying wannabe actor, busy bee and mama's boy played by Hrvoje Barisic, a pleasant surprise. I can only imagine how irritable he could get if directed by such masters of annoyance like Gervais, Merchant or Larry David, but Mrsic manages to keep him likable. That is the main forte and the charm of this movie – a feel good atmosphere, light humor, discreet pathos, free of any presumptuousness. Not to mention the grand finale. Comedy is a tricky business, especially when it aims to appeal to the masses. Anybody can make some drunken friends laugh, but big audiences are tough, and critics even tougher. Mrsic and Cowboys did it, and the fact that they reached their goal without over psychologizing the characters or overdramatizing and by using a bunch of commonplace devices, makes their triumph even greater","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1024,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie itself seemed pretty good, the plot and the actors were excellent but, the ending was not an ending. I know a lot of people just say its an open ending, but this was such a bad timing, its almost like the movie started with a budget and just used it up before they could ever finish it and decided it would just end. I have never read the book, and i just found this movie in a trailer, but if you like teen romances and you just want to watch a great movie, then you should watch it. But if you are looking for a really good, deep thought movie, then this is not the one. I really liked it but it went so fast and was so predictable. I gave it 6 stars because it is both great and awful at the same time.

I know a lot of people hate in these reviews but this movie i honestly felt like i should give one too. The movie itself seemed pretty good, the plot and the actors were excellent but, the ending was not an ending. I know a lot of people just say its an open ending, but this was such a bad timing, its almost like the movie started with a budget and just used it up before they could ever finish it and decided it would just end. I have never read the book, and i just found this movie in a trailer, but if you like teen romances and you just want to watch a great movie, then you should watch it. But if you are looking for a really good, deep thought movie, then this is not the one. I really liked it but it went so fast and was so predictable. I gave it 6 stars because it is both great and awful at the same time. Hope you enjoy!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13825,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That is, until 2017. The sci-fi/fantasy action comedy "Colossal" (R, 1:50) qualifies  in name, if not in reality. Hathaway's first feature film was the 2001 Disney hit "The Princess Diaries", which led to a couple more princess movies ("The Princess Diaries: Royal Engagement" and "Ella Enchanted"). Hathaway soon transitioned to adult roles in movies like "Havoc", "Brokeback Mountain" and "Love &amp; Other Drugs". Her talent made her an Academy darling, as she was nominated for an Oscar for 2008's "Rachel Getting Married", she co-hosted the 2011 Academy Awards (with James Franco) and then she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her acting and singing in 2012's "Les Misérables". Since then, she reprised her role as the voice of Jewel in "Rio 2", again played The White Queen in "Alice Through the Looking Glass" and starred in "Interstellar", "The Intern" and "Colossal".\n\nHathaway plays Gloria, a confirmed party girl who can't hold a job and shows all the signs of being an alcoholic. She lives with her boyfriend, Tim (Dan Stevens, in one of his half-dozen or so 2017 films), who tires of her irresponsible ways and kicks her out. She has no choice but to move back to her small (unspecified) hometown and start living in her childhood home which is (for unspecified reasons) unfurnished and vacant. While hauling a newly purchased air mattress back to her parents' house, she runs into Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), a childhood friend who now runs his late father's minimally successful bar. Gloria starts hanging out with Oscar and his after-hours drinking buddies, Garth (Tim Blake Nelson) and Joel (Austin Stowell). Oscar soon offers Gloria a job as a waitress and starts bringing her some major creature comforts (furniture, a big-screen TV, etc.), obviously trying to get her interested in him romantically, even though she's still in contact with Tim and seems to have eyes for the handsome Joel.\n\nBut it's only when a colossal, vaguely human-looking monster suddenly appears and wreaks Godzilla-style havoc on Seoul, South Korea that Gloria's life REALLY gets complicated. Watching news footage, she sees that this monster seems to have her scalp-scratching nervous tic. Then, she notices that this creature half-way around the world, makes the same gestures and movements that she makes when she happens to be in the playground area of a local park – and at exactly 8:05 a.m. local time (a time and place with which she only has a tenuous connection with roots in her childhood). After another all-night drinking session, Gloria brings Oscar, Joel and Garth to the playground, asks them to stream live news from Seoul and demonstrates her connection to the monster. Then, as she and her friends try to figure out what's really going on and what it means (and as she's racked with guilt over the destruction and loss of life in Seoul) another creature appears, one that seems to have issues with Gloria's monster.\n\n"Colossal" is an original and fun, but highly flawed movie. The premise that Spanish writer-director (and past Oscar nominee) Nacho Vigalondo gives us is gleefully fresh and loaded with potential. It even features subtle messages about addiction and toxic relationships. The problem is the details. Too much goes unexplained – and the reasons that are given for the story's strange and remarkable occurrences are thinly and illogically developed. It's enough to drive a reflective Movie Fan to distraction. And that's before we even discuss the unnecessarily off-putting developments regarding some of the characters. It's as if Vigalondo has set a fantastic table and then tried to do that trick of yanking the tablecloth out from under the dishes, only to break most of them. In other words, I loved the first half of this movie, hated much of the second half and only kind of liked the ending.\n\nFor me, all that adds up to a mild recommendation, based on the movie's creative premise, Hathaway's typically excellent work and the entertainment value of about half of the film. (Sudeikis' superficial performance in what is admittedly a tough role to play doesn't do Vigalondo any favors.) I can't even evaluate the movie with a bad pun based on its title, because it's neither a colossal success nor a colossal failure. There's a great movie somewhere in there trying to break out, but it's held back by its own unfortunate and avoidable shortcomings. My advice? Watch up to the point that Gloria motions for Oscar to leave the playground. Then stop. That moment feels like an ending (to an enjoyable movie). But considering everything between the opening credits and the closing credits, the most that I can give this underachiever is a "B".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That is, until 2017. The sci-fi/fantasy action comedy "Colossal" (R, 1:50) qualifies  in name, if not in reality. Hathaway's first feature film was the 2001 Disney hit "The Princess Diaries", which led to a couple more princess movies ("The Princess Diaries: Royal Engagement" and "Ella Enchanted"). Hathaway soon transitioned to adult roles in movies like "Havoc", "Brokeback Mountain" and "Love &amp; Other Drugs". Her talent made her an Academy darling, as she was nominated for an Oscar for 2008's "Rachel Getting Married", she co-hosted the 2011 Academy Awards (with James Franco) and then she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her acting and singing in 2012's "Les Misérables". Since then, she reprised her role as the voice of Jewel in "Rio 2", again played The White Queen in "Alice Through the Looking Glass" and starred in "Interstellar", "The Intern" and "Colossal".\n\nHathaway plays Gloria, a confirmed party girl who can't hold a job and shows all the signs of being an alcoholic. She lives with her boyfriend, Tim (Dan Stevens, in one of his half-dozen or so 2017 films), who tires of her irresponsible ways and kicks her out. She has no choice but to move back to her small (unspecified) hometown and start living in her childhood home which is (for unspecified reasons) unfurnished and vacant. While hauling a newly purchased air mattress back to her parents' house, she runs into Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), a childhood friend who now runs his late father's minimally successful bar. Gloria starts hanging out with Oscar and his after-hours drinking buddies, Garth (Tim Blake Nelson) and Joel (Austin Stowell). Oscar soon offers Gloria a job as a waitress and starts bringing her some major creature comforts (furniture, a big-screen TV, etc.), obviously trying to get her interested in him romantically, even though she's still in contact with Tim and seems to have eyes for the handsome Joel.\n\nBut it's only when a colossal, vaguely human-looking monster suddenly appears and wreaks Godzilla-style havoc on Seoul, South Korea that Gloria's life REALLY gets complicated. Watching news footage, she sees that this monster seems to have her scalp-scratching nervous tic. Then, she notices that this creature half-way around the world, makes the same gestures and movements that she makes when she happens to be in the playground area of a local park – and at exactly 8:05 a.m. local time (a time and place with which she only has a tenuous connection with roots in her childhood). After another all-night drinking session, Gloria brings Oscar, Joel and Garth to the playground, asks them to stream live news from Seoul and demonstrates her connection to the monster. Then, as she and her friends try to figure out what's really going on and what it means (and as she's racked with guilt over the destruction and loss of life in Seoul) another creature appears, one that seems to have issues with Gloria's monster.\n\n"Colossal" is an original and fun, but highly flawed movie. The premise that Spanish writer-director (and past Oscar nominee) Nacho Vigalondo gives us is gleefully fresh and loaded with potential. It even features subtle messages about addiction and toxic relationships. The problem is the details. Too much goes unexplained – and the reasons that are given for the story's strange and remarkable occurrences are thinly and illogically developed. It's enough to drive a reflective Movie Fan to distraction. And that's before we even discuss the unnecessarily off-putting developments regarding some of the characters. It's as if Vigalondo has set a fantastic table and then tried to do that trick of yanking the tablecloth out from under the dishes, only to break most of them. In other words, I loved the first half of this movie, hated much of the second half and only kind of liked the ending.\n\nFor me, all that adds up to a mild recommendation, based on the movie's creative premise, Hathaway's typically excellent work and the entertainment value of about half of the film. (Sudeikis' superficial performance in what is admittedly a tough role to play doesn't do Vigalondo any favors.) I can't even evaluate the movie with a bad pun based on its title, because it's neither a colossal success nor a colossal failure. There's a great movie somewhere in there trying to break out, but it's held back by its own unfortunate and avoidable shortcomings. My advice? Watch up to the point that Gloria motions for Oscar to leave the playground. Then stop. That moment feels like an ending (to an enjoyable movie). But considering everything between the opening credits and the closing credits, the most that I can give this underachiever is a "B".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"The English Patient" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.\n\n"The English Patient", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.\n\nThat's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.\n\nTo be blunt, "The English Patient" is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later "Cold Mountain" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of "Vertigo" (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.\n\nPerformances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical, questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.\n\nDespite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one, it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the film, it just seems a little distracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.\n\nNevertheless, these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside, "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me, it was sort of like an insane mix up between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"duration":"PT2H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The English Patient" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.\n\n"The English Patient", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.\n\nThat's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.\n\nTo be blunt, "The English Patient" is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently.

Bob Hope is an absolute riot! Almost every single line by Bob Hope (the fake Humphrey the butler) is quotable and hilarious! We would love to list our favorite "Humphrey"/Bob lines here but there are too many to list! This is our favorite Lucille Ball movie (besides "The Long, Long Trailer") and one of our very, very favorite Bob Hope movies (besides "The Lemon Drop Kid" and "The Princess and The Pirate"). Many movies have forgettable soundtracks but the three songs in this movie are memorable, clever, fun, get your feet tapping and put a smile on your face! We cannot find one fault in this entire movie (except we sincerely hope all the animals were treated humanely during filming). If you've had a bad day, this movie will definitely put a smile on your face and give you plenty of belly laughs! This film deserves 20 stars!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One of the movies that Charlie starred in in his hey day was a little movie from HBO called "Beyond the Law" in 1993. In it, Charlie stars as Daniel Saxon, a small town cop who's struggling with demons from his past as well as his identity of being half Native American when out of the blue, he gets an offer from a federal agent (the underrated Courtney B. Vance) to infiltrate a brutal biker gang known as the Jackals. With the help of a biker misfit named Virgil (the constant scene stealing Leon Rippy) Saxon is able to learn how to act, think, and look like a real mean biker. His performance is so good in fact, that the club's leader, Blood (played by the always menacing Michael Madsen) actually offers Saxon membership in the club.However, the deeper Daniel goes undercover, the more trouble he has in keeping his soul from descending into the dark hell permanently. The story is also able to draw on the character's Native American roots and provide a spiritual allegory of losing one's self to the darkness and finding it again. \n\nWhat's more, this was apparently based on a true story; however, like a lot of Hollywood true tales, I'm sure the filmmakers decided to add a little embellishment here and there. Still, the real life agent (his real name being Dan Black) did serve as a technical adviser and does appear somewhere in the film as an extra. Another thing that adds to the film is the surprisingly good soundtrack that accompanies the action. I say surprisingly because, for the most part, the soundtrack is done by unknowns but it just goes to show you that you don't need famous musicians to do a good soundtrack; sometimes just any good musicians will do the trick. Also starring the beautiful Linda Fiorentino as a photo journalist who helps lead Daniel away from the darkness and in a small role, the legendary Rip Torn, "Beyond the Law" is a nice way to kill some time by providing you with a good story and some really nice motorcycles. 9 out of 10.

    <desc lang="hr">Trojica revolveraša u dugim zapadnjačkim smeđim kaputima od kože čekaju vlak na željezničkoj postaji negdje na Divljem zapadu. Trojica revolveraša u dugim zapadnjačkim smeđim kaputima od kože čekaju vlak na željezničkoj postaji negdje na Divljem zapadu. Kad vlak stigne, čini im se da onaj koga čekaju nije stigao, no ubrzo čuju zvuk usne harmonike i ugledaju nepoznatog stranca zvanog Harmonika (C. Bronson). U okršaju on ubije trojicu revolveraša. Istodobno na ranču Sweetwater u vlasništvu Irca Breta Mekbejna (F Wolff) njegova kći uređuje svečani svadbeni stol, stariji sin sprema se kolima u grad po nevjestu koja stiže vlakom. Iznenada se pojavi grupa revolveraša u istim dugim kaputima od kože kao i oni na željezničkoj postaji, predvođenih Frenkom (H. Fonda). Poubijaju cijelu obitelj. Lijepa Džil Mekbejn (C. Cardinale) zaludu čeka supruga na postaji i na kraju kreće sama na imanje, gdje mještani pokapaju mrtve.Šerif zaključi da je ubojica odmetnik zvan Čejene (J. Robards), vođa bande odjevene u duge smeđe kapute od kože. Dok Čejene bježi od potjere i pokušava doznati tko mu je podmetnuo ubojstva, Frenk radi za bogatog umirućeg graditelja željeznice Mortona (G. Ferzetti) i ubija sve koji se - poput Breta Mekbejna - sa svojim imanjima nađu na trasi buduće željeznice. Džil upozna Harmoniku i Čejenea, otkriva da je imanje jako vrijedno, te da je njezin pokojni muž već kupio građu buduće željezničke postaje. Frenk uspije zastrašiti Džil da na namještenoj dražbi proda imanje za smiješnu svotu, no umiješaju se Harmonika i Čejene te vješto daju mnogo veću ponudu i otkupe zemlju. Nazire se okršaj Harmonike i Frenka, a razlog tome nije samo bitka za Džilino imanje već i davni zločin zbog kojega se Harmonika želi osvetiti Frenku...</desc>

When a low budget movie that was filmed in 10 days with very few characters, markedly rivets ones attention, that is a telltale sign of a a good and unusual production. The attire and settings were very convincing. The three leading characters all portrayed Hispanics extremely unusual for a 1950s western. The acting/directing was very good. The movie discusses female servitude/abuse; and the lure of money and its impact on ones loyalty, profession, and romantic decisions. With few characters and a low budget, the movie project took the very little and turned into quite an interesting and believable flick, of a different kind, that found time to examine core aspects of human behavior. In the same general genre as For Whom the Bell Tolls, but yet so different.

When a low budget movie that was filmed in 10 days with very few characters, markedly rivets ones attention, that is a telltale sign of a a good and unusual production. The attire and settings were very convincing. The three leading characters all portrayed Hispanics extremely unusual for a 1950s western. The acting/directing was very good. The movie discusses female servitude/abuse; and the lure of money and its impact on ones loyalty, profession, and romantic decisions. With few characters and a low budget, the movie project took the very little and turned into quite an interesting and believable flick, of a different kind, that found time to examine core aspects of human behavior. In the same general genre as For Whom the Bell Tolls, but yet so different. Wow!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":596,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So its all out war for unlucky Police Detective named McClane, in a heart-stopping, jet-propelled journey through excitement and terror.\n\nOn a snowy Christmas Eve in the nation's capital, a team of terrorist have seized a major international airport, and now holds thousands of holiday travellers hostage. The terrorists, a renegade band of crack military commandos led by murderous rogue officer, have come to rescue a drug lord from justice. They've prepared for every contingency, except one: John McClane, an off-duty cop seized by a feeling of deadly deja vu. The heroic cop not only has to battle terrorists, but also an incompetent airport police chief, the hard headed commander of the army's anti-terrorist squad and a deadly winter snowstorm. The runways are littered with death and destruction, and McClane is in a race against time. His wife is trapped on one of the planes circling somewhere overhead, desperately low on fuel!\n\nDie Hard 2 makes Bruce Willis look better and better. The role of John McClane is one filled with the fight for right and to trying to stop the bad guys. Again a lot of the stunts would have been done by Willis considering the professionalism of the man. Running all over an airport in a fierce snowstorm, fighting scenes on the wing of a real 747 jet and trying to save lives he has no attachment to, L.A. cop John McClane puts his body on the line, so justice is served and so did the actor Bruce Willis in my view to bring a great action movie back for a second time. Willis is one of my favourite actors, but I have only started to watch his movies in about the last 2-3 years and what a mistake that has been.   \n\nThis film has more freedom as it is held at an airport. McClane is like I have said all over the place. The freedom and space this story has makes this film much easier to watch. Another thing which is impressive about Die Hard 2 is the effort to put more thrills in the movie. The snow (which of course is man made) has a major role, so do all the planes making quite a crisis on their hands. Not only do they fight on the wing of a 747, but also fly a real helicopter on the wing of the plane also. The scene where McClane ejects himself from the exploding plane is another favourite scene of mine. Other parts of this movie which stunned me I wont tell you about as it will give too much away, but trust me they are exceptionally done.\n\nAgain the bad guys have a major role in this one. William Saddler is Colonial Stuart, a heartless leader, who only cares that a drug lord escapes and can get in on all the money making scheme. I loved his role in this. Another face that I remember in Die hard 2 who was a bad guy is Robert Patrick. I loved his role in Terminator 2. But the conflict between the good guys is extremely tense. Especially between McClane and Police Officer Lorenzo played by L.A law star Dennis Franz. It is hard to understand if this character is on the side for good or not. \n\nHere comes another analogy on Die Hard 2, do you ever know who is on the side of good or bad? Well for at least three quarters of the film it is unsure. The storywriters need to be commended because the story left me intrigued and when you think you know what is about to happen, the circumstances change. Also having a different director, gave this sequel new prospective. Director Renny Harlin threw his hand into the ring. What a gamble? An unknown director, but to my surprise I say that it worked. His other films worth mentioning include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and Cliffhanger. \n\nSo overall Die Hard 2 was extremely enjoyable sequel to watch. The story, the characters and the situation are all of a great tension, which I love in a movie. So one cop who is so vulnerable and emotional ends up being the one person who you would most like to have save your life. Like Willis said in an interview Die Hard 2 - Die Harder - it's bigger, badder and louder. I will leave you with one question, the first Die Hard had approximately 20 people die, can you count for me how many perish in this film? It is quite a turn around!\n\nRating: 4/5 or 9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":342228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not a question everybody is going to have to ask themselves, to be sure, but what if that guy moved in next door to you?  It's a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two.  Which is exactly what happens in `The Whole Nine Yards,' directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hit-man Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he's on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas `Oz' Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland).  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there's a price on Jimmy's head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who's responsible for his father going away for a long, long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes. But, of course, he should have stayed with his instincts, because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble.  And the only way out, it seems, is down...\n\n\tWhat Lynn put together here is actually a fairly light-hearted, black comedy; the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it, and there is, but much of it is implied rather than graphic.  The pace is good, and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about.  There's not a lot of depth, but it's not necessary; the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype, and it works perfectly for this film and the story.  Some of what happens is inevitable, though not necessarily predictable, and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side, nothing in this story is cut and dried.\n\n\tWillis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip, giving a rather reserved, subtle performance that puts Jimmy's guarded but confident manner into perspective. Underneath it all, this guy is really rather cold-blooded (he has to be, given his choice of employment), but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth, at least externally.  Like Chow Yun-Fat in `The Killer,' Jimmy is likable, but when you consider at arm's length who he is  and what he is capable of, it's a bit disconcerting.  And that's one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting-- because you know who and what Jimmy is, you never really know which way things are going to turn. \n\n \tPerry is excellent, as well, as `Oz.'  Henpecked and in dire straits, he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in `It's A Gift' or `The Bank Dick,' although a bit darker.  Perry is charismatic, has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect.  His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious, and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work.  And it's the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments.\n\n\tThe supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), Amanda Peet (Jill St. Claire), Harland Williams (Special Agent Hanson) and Serge Christianssens (Mr. Boulez).  It may not be the most original movie ever made, but `The Whole Nine Yards' is funny, has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you've basically seen before and made them their own, and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do:  Entertain.  It's not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today, but it's going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles.  Which, when you think about it, is not such a bad deal.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel "The Hellbound Heart". The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...\n\nThe main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're "too gory" or "stupid" - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.\n\nA writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film - but Hellraiser has none of it! The entire cast shine, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.\n\nOverall, I have pointed out a couple of flaws here; but I really can't bring myself to give this masterpiece any less than full marks. The originality on display throughout Hellraiser is astounding, as is the atmosphere and the performances pulled out of the actors, along with the fact that this film has entertained me many times and is still as good today as the first time I saw it. All of this ensures that Hellraiser will be an endearing favourite of mine for the rest of my life. If you consider yourself a fan of horror and haven't seen this; shame on you. Make sure you read the book, too!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106742,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel "The Hellbound Heart". The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...\n\nThe main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're "too gory" or "stupid" - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.\n\nA writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating.

The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance).

Part two was decent, but after that it was a convoluted mess and it became more and more challenging to keep the characters and plot straight. While this film does its best to tie everything together (especially by bringing back Dr. Gordon), it is still part seven within seven years... and if not the weakest, at least among the worst. The 3D was not needed, and we have moved far away from the tight story we started with.\n\nFor what it is worth, I have to give credit to writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan. First of all, they are nice guys. And second, they have done a fine job writing this film (and the other films they have done). If I was given the chance to write a film, I would too, so I cannot put the blame on them. If anything, they deserve credit for writing a script that kills the series. I cannot hold it against the director, either... he has been involved since day one in the series, so this could be seen as his baby more than anyone else's, perhaps.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92500,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Part two was decent, but after that it was a convoluted mess and it became more and more challenging to keep the characters and plot straight. While this film does its best to tie everything together (especially by bringing back Dr. Gordon), it is still part seven within seven years... and if not the weakest, at least among the worst. The 3D was not needed, and we have moved far away from the tight story we started with.\n\nFor what it is worth, I have to give credit to writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan. First of all, they are nice guys. And second, they have done a fine job writing this film (and the other films they have done). If I was given the chance to write a film, I would too, so I cannot put the blame on them. If anything, they deserve credit for writing a script that kills the series. I cannot hold it against the director, either... he has been involved since day one in the series, so this could be seen as his baby more than anyone else's, perhaps.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92500,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.\n\nThe year is 1965 and an eccentric young Detective Constable, Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans), is making waves at the Oxford City Police with not only his unorthodox but brilliant methods of deduction, but for his refusal to tow the line in order to please the upper echelons of both the Force and society. Under the steadfast guidance of the seasoned and similarly incorruptible, Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), Morse finds himself embroiled in a number of complex cases that expose him to the darker side of life and human nature.\n\nAlthough the series will naturally draw comparisons to its popular predecessor, thanks to the show's gripping narratives, vibrant swinging sixties backdrop and perfect blend of light and dark overtones, Endeavour is easily able to distinguish itself by its own considerable merits. \n\nMuch of the show's success can be attributed to the ingenious casting of Evans, who puts his own unique stamp on the iconic role. Of course there are parallels to the world weary DI so expertly embodied by John Thaw, but Evans wisely avoids imitation, as the twenty-year age difference between the two interpretations allows the actor to create something fresh. The addition of the character of Fred Thursday is inspired. The street wise, war veteran is the perfect mentor for the idealistic Morse and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series. Fantastic entertainment on every level!\n\nhttp://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19747,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They decide to abandon the flat when a monster terrorizes the Great Apple , breaking buildings , and every to get in its ways. Various characters cross paths with the giant beast, and they attempt to escape along with a young carrying a hand-held video camera.\n\nThis eerie tale is plenty of thrills, chills, restless horror and suspense . Film itself takes place from point of sight of a cameraman , with camera over shoulders , displaying a documentary style filmed by photographer Michael Bonvilliam . In fact , during the first weekend of the release, many theaters posted signs warning guests that the hand held camera movements may cause motion sickness . The title "Cloverfield"; initially just a codename for the movie, is named for the boulevard in Santa Monica where the Bad Robot offices were located during the making of the film . Good but unknown cast as Michael Sthal , Jessica Lucas, Odette Yusman , Michael Vogel, among others . Well worth watching if you appeal shaky cameras , such as : ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 days/ Weeks after¨ or the classic Italian ¨Holocaust cannibal¨; and recently ¨Rec (2007)¨ by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguero and its American remake ¨Quarintine (2008)¨ by John Erik . The flick is a crossover between Gozilla picture , catastrophe genre and documentary with Steadicam camera . Lavishly produced by J.J.Abrams (Lost, Star Trek) and Bryan Burk with excellent special effects and monsters made by Phill Tippet studio . The motion picture picture was professionally directed by Matt Reeves . He's a writer, producer (Yards) and director for television (Felicity) and eventually for cinema ; furthermore , usual collaborator of J.J. Abrams . Rating : Interesing and spectacular , above average.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":377373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They decide to abandon the flat when a monster terrorizes the Great Apple , breaking buildings , and every to get in its ways. Various characters cross paths with the giant beast, and they attempt to escape along with a young carrying a hand-held video camera.\n\nThis eerie tale is plenty of thrills, chills, restless horror and suspense . Film itself takes place from point of sight of a cameraman , with camera over shoulders , displaying a documentary style filmed by photographer Michael Bonvilliam . In fact , during the first weekend of the release, many theaters posted signs warning guests that the hand held camera movements may cause motion sickness . The title "Cloverfield"; initially just a codename for the movie, is named for the boulevard in Santa Monica where the Bad Robot offices were located during the making of the film . Good but unknown cast as Michael Sthal , Jessica Lucas, Odette Yusman , Michael Vogel, among others . Well worth watching if you appeal shaky cameras , such as : ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 days/ Weeks after¨ or the classic Italian ¨Holocaust cannibal¨; and recently ¨Rec (2007)¨ by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguero and its American remake ¨Quarintine (2008)¨ by John Erik . The flick is a crossover between Gozilla picture , catastrophe genre and documentary with Steadicam camera . Lavishly produced by J.J.Abrams (Lost, Star Trek) and Bryan Burk with excellent special effects and monsters made by Phill Tippet studio . The motion picture picture was professionally directed by Matt Reeves . He's a writer, producer (Yards) and director for television (Felicity) and eventually for cinema ; furthermore , usual collaborator of J.J. Abrams . Rating : Interesing and spectacular , above average.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":377373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Was it the effects that ruined it, was it the lame story, the extra-lame acting of the second Smith in the movie, the directing of someone who got after Signs too much credit and couldn't deliver since (with the exception of the low budget Devil). I really cant say. Its just very disappointing and I wished I would not have seen it, not spend the time nor the money. But I wanted to know it for myself if the critics are right, since they are so many times wrong (in my opinion). \n\nWell, they are right, and yet they even gave the movie way too much credit. Probably because of Will Smith.\n\nThe year is not over, but I do not think that After earth will be topped in the category for "the worst movie of 2013"!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":193610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nova priča zatječe Dianu Prince kako neprimjetno živi među smrtnicima u živahnim, elegantnim 1980-ima - eri hedonizma i želje za posjedovanjem. Iako je u potpunosti razvila svoje moći, ona ostaje pritajena, bavi se prikupljanjem drevnih artefakta, a herojska djela izvodi samo potajno. Međutim, Diana će uskoro morati skupiti svu svoju snagu, mudrost i hrabrost kad se sukobi s Maxwellom Lordom i Cheetom, zlikovkom koja posjeduje nadljudsku snagu i spretnost.</desc>

I'd never seen a movie with The Rock before or even watched any wrestling so I was kind of dubious as to whether or not he would be any good. \n\nIn fact he was a great actor, full of personality and charisma, willing to make fun of himself and was great with the action. The Rock is definitely the next Arnie. Vin (Donald Duck) Diesel is the next Jean Claude Van Damme.\n\nSeann William Scott was also pretty funny in a rare NOT Stifler performance. As an actor he does have genuine talent that's usually wasted in low-brow teen sex comedies. \n\nThe Rundown is a sort of Indiana Jones-lite movie. The Rock plays a bounty hunter/chef who is sent to track down Seann William Scott south of the border. Against his will The Rock ends up on a trek through the depths of the Mexican jungle looking for some ancient artefact. Unoriginal it may be but director Peter Berg keeps it moving with plenty of stunts, action and laughs. Christopher Walken's villain is a bit of a cardboard cut-out but how evil are you allowed to be in a PG-13?\n\nI look forward to the next movie starring The Rock. With talks of a third Conan movie I can only imagine him being the best choice. And keep a lookout for Arnie in the nightclub at the very beginning. 'Have fun' is his only line. And fun The Rock will certainly have as the next BIG action hero.\n\nKeep a lookout for Scottish actor Ewan Bremner (a zillion times the 'star' Ewan MacGregor is) in a funny role as a slob pilot.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'd never seen a movie with The Rock before or even watched any wrestling so I was kind of dubious as to whether or not he would be any good. \n\nIn fact he was a great actor, full of personality and charisma, willing to make fun of himself and was great with the action. The Rock is definitely the next Arnie. Vin (Donald Duck) Diesel is the next Jean Claude Van Damme.\n\nSeann William Scott was also pretty funny in a rare NOT Stifler performance. As an actor he does have genuine talent that's usually wasted in low-brow teen sex comedies. \n\nThe Rundown is a sort of Indiana Jones-lite movie. The Rock plays a bounty hunter/chef who is sent to track down Seann William Scott south of the border. Against his will The Rock ends up on a trek through the depths of the Mexican jungle looking for some ancient artefact. Unoriginal it may be but director Peter Berg keeps it moving with plenty of stunts, action and laughs. Christopher Walken's villain is a bit of a cardboard cut-out but how evil are you allowed to be in a PG-13?\n\nI look forward to the next movie starring The Rock. With talks of a third Conan movie I can only imagine him being the best choice. And keep a lookout for Arnie in the nightclub at the very beginning. 'Have fun' is his only line. And fun The Rock will certainly have as the next BIG action hero.\n\nKeep a lookout for Scottish actor Ewan Bremner (a zillion times the 'star' Ewan MacGregor is) in a funny role as a slob pilot.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's definitely a natural, and while other actors in the business try to impress the audience and make the most to show their talent, Maguire acts with subtlety and thoughtfulness.\n\nThe film might seem a bit slow for some people accustomed to more pacey and epic films. However, those who have read the novel will realize just how fast everything goes. \n\nRachel Portman's score is truly beautiful: probably one of her best.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94392,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A mixture of fact and fiction often blurs the tedious factual parts with outlandish falsehoods to make the show more exciting as a whole. Therefore it can often be difficult to engage yourself to view it as fact as there are a large number of scenes which appear to be grandstanding for the viewers.\n\nDespite the above, the series is actually an exciting drama with some occasional comedy moments. It's certainly worth a viewing. The acting itself appears great, however it's difficult to know how good the acting is considering we're unaware whether the actors are portraying the Ingrams directly or whether there have been things added.\n\nThe reason for the 7/10 is not due to the production, excitement or directing, it is due to the script. I am slightly perplexed as to why the script has been written to feel empathy towards Charles Ingram.

A mixture of fact and fiction often blurs the tedious factual parts with outlandish falsehoods to make the show more exciting as a whole. Therefore it can often be difficult to engage yourself to view it as fact as there are a large number of scenes which appear to be grandstanding for the viewers.\n\nDespite the above, the series is actually an exciting drama with some occasional comedy moments. It's certainly worth a viewing. The acting itself appears great, however it's difficult to know how good the acting is considering we're unaware whether the actors are portraying the Ingrams directly or whether there have been things added.\n\nThe reason for the 7/10 is not due to the production, excitement or directing, it is due to the script. I am slightly perplexed as to why the script has been written to feel empathy towards Charles Ingram. Although the wife was responsible for pushing Charles, he has surprisingly been made to look the innocent party, this is despite Charles committing insurance fraud before the quiz show fraud. So why has the script been written to make us feel empathetic?\n\nOverall the show is well worth the watch. It's exciting, gripping and interesting.

It was mostly recorded in his century-old barn, with a 30-piece orchestra, some new vocal arrangements by Patti Scialfa, and an audience of a few friends and the horses in the stables below.\n\nEach song is introduced by Bruce, often as a voiceover as various images play, some of which are Bruce's archival photos or home movie clips. The lynchpin song is Western Stars, about an old cowboy still going on, when many of his contemporaries have left their boots (a song likely to be self-referential, given his approaching 70th birthday).\n\nI saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival, but not at the premium-priced world premiere, so Bruce had already left, leaving fellow director Thom Zimmy to answer questions. Bruce's directorial contributions included writing and producing the song introductions, and co-selecting the archival material to include. The intros make it feel that this album is a collection of poems set to music. With songs about cars, trains, heartbreak, and love, I wonder if someone will do a full country re-creation of the material. The film ends with a bonus song (that fits the overall theme), which is more upbeat than Moonlight Motel.\n\nEven being only casually acquainted with Bruce's music, I found this film fascinating. It is probably a must-see for actual fans, especially those who have already memorized the lyrics. It is expected to open commercially October 25.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1576,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was mostly recorded in his century-old barn, with a 30-piece orchestra, some new vocal arrangements by Patti Scialfa, and an audience of a few friends and the horses in the stables below.\n\nEach song is introduced by Bruce, often as a voiceover as various images play, some of which are Bruce's archival photos or home movie clips. The lynchpin song is Western Stars, about an old cowboy still going on, when many of his contemporaries have left their boots (a song likely to be self-referential, given his approaching 70th birthday).\n\nI saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival, but not at the premium-priced world premiere, so Bruce had already left, leaving fellow director Thom Zimmy to answer questions. Bruce's directorial contributions included writing and producing the song introductions, and co-selecting the archival material to include. The intros make it feel that this album is a collection of poems set to music. With songs about cars, trains, heartbreak, and love, I wonder if someone will do a full country re-creation of the material. The film ends with a bonus song (that fits the overall theme), which is more upbeat than Moonlight Motel.\n\nEven being only casually acquainted with Bruce's music, I found this film fascinating. It is probably a must-see for actual fans, especially those who have already memorized the lyrics. It is expected to open commercially October 25.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1576,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rocky asks Adonis "Donnie" Creed, played by amazing Michael B. Jordan, "What are you fighting for?" World Heavyweight Champion Donne was physically massacred in a previous fight with 6' 5", 245 pound 'beast' Viktor Drago, played by real-life German boxer Florian Munteanu, son of Ivan Drago, surprising Dolph Lundgren.\n\nRecall from "Rocky IV" Ivan killed Adonis's Father Apollo Creed in an exhibition boxing match that Rocky declined. Rocky could have saved his best friend Apollo by stopping the fight, but he didn't. That haunted Rocky for the last 33 years. In "Rocky IV" Rocky traveled to Moscow to fight Ivan to avenge Apollo's death. He knocks out Ivan in the final round. Steroid juiced Ivan was supposed to be the "perfect" fighter. Perhaps, not. This all happened before Adonis was even born. In the past.\n\nSo what is Donne fighting for? Director Steven Caple Jr. creates Donnie's journey in "Creed II" with less poignancy and clarity than the original "Creed". Steven replaced Ryan Coogler as director with somewhat lesser human transparency. Yet, "Creed II" is good enough. "Creed II" is the compelling narrative of the 'Sins of the Fathers'. In a touching moment in Rocky's restaurant "Adrian's" Ivan confronts Rocky for the first time since they fought.\n\nGranite-like Dolph as Ivan commands subtle gravitas. He says to Rocky, "Because of you, I lost everything." When Ivan lost to Rocky he plummeted from virtual paragon to social outcast in Ukraine. His wife left both him and his son Viktor. All Viktor knows is fighting. He was "raised in hate" by Ivan. We witness their "tough love" relationship as the movie opens as Ivan chastises Viktor to run faster while driving in his van. They both have something to prove.\n\nThat volatile Father-Son dynamic is the realistic anchor of Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor's screenplay. Sly and Juel might have intended for more Shakespearean, but the narrative is too broad and unfocused. In "Creed" I was in tears as Donnie tells Rocky not to stop his fight. He still had something to prove: "That I'm not a mistake." In "Creed II" Rocky has become the Father, Donnie needed. However, Rocky is incomplete in his own relationship with his son Robert, played by Milo Ventimiglia.\n\nDonnie must reconcile his late father Apollo's legacy, a man he never knew. Totally chiseled Michael B. inspires authentic suffering and vulnerability as Donnie seeks to discover himself. The boxing scenes in "Creed II" are visually astounding. Michael gained 20 pounds of muscle and along with Florian trained intensely for months.\n\nWhere the fights in "Creed" had an authentic realism, "Creed II" is more theatrical in the shear speed and power displayed on screen. The traded blows make you wince. That visceral emotion comes across in the first fight. Donnie is the valiant champion, who is truly afraid. Viktor is bigger, faster, and stronger. How can he win?\n\nIt's in the life outside the ring that redeems and transcends "Creed II". In the whimsical scene after Donnie wins the Heavyweight Championship, he asks his "Unc" for advice in proposing to Bianca, radiantly beautiful Tessa Thompson. Bianca is Donnie's longtime girlfriend, the gifted singer-composer gradually losing her hearing to a degenerative disease. Rocky tells Donnie to forget what's in your head, go with what's in your heart. When "Creed II" shows its heart as Michael B cries watching the diagnostic monitor in the hospital, it reminds that humanity and family worth fighting for.\n\nMichael B eloquently defines the Hero in his courageous acts and in the power of his tears. He and Dolph discover the forgiveness in our sins of the past. Michael empowers "Creed II": Life is about the passion of what we love, whether we win or lose. That's what is at stake in Donnie and Vilktor's climactic Championship fight.\n\nIn the timeless tale of Fathers and Sons: The Son wants to know that his Father is proud of him. The Son wants to know his Father's love. In this "Creed II" delivers a knockout. We all need to know that we're enough, that we all deserve to be loved.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109860,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Prva sezona antologijske humoristične serije "Čudotvorci", snimljene prema knjizi "What in God's Name" Simona Richa, komedija je na radnome mjestu koja se odvija u Raju. U seriji glume Daniel Radcliffe, Steve Buscemi, Geraldine Viswanathan i Karan Soni. Radcliffe glumi Craiga, niskorangirana anđela odgovorna za ljudske molitve, a Steve Buscemi glumi Craigova šefa, Boga, koji je dignuo ruke od ljudskog roda te je spreman krenuti na idući projekt. Da bi spriječili uništenje Zemlje, Craig i anđelica Eliza (Geraldine Viswanathan) moraju uslišati naoko nemoguću molitvu: pomoći dvama ljudskim bićima, Lauri i Samu, da se zaljube jedno u drugo.</desc>

James Bond 007 action film the best one that was ever made. In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.\n\nI'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get's bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction from Martin Campbell. The stunts are completely insane in scale in this movie and really dangerous.\n\nMusic score is by Éric Serra, the title song is GoldenEye performed by Tina Turner. GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond: Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.\n\nStyle and sophistication are in abundance - - "The name's Bond. James Bond." \n\nGoldeneye's female characters are honestly beautiful with particular techniques. The bad one is Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an ex-Soviet fighter pilot who tranquilly smokes big cigars and knocks off her victims with her 'killer thighs.' In one scene, she challenges Bond's legendary Aston Martin DB5 to a wild road race outside Monte Carlo with her red Ferrari: in another she was so smart that she snatches a top-secret helicopter from under the noses of the French navy. \n\nIzabella Scorupco is a great and the finest Bond girl, the irresistible Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) who 'tastes like strawberries.' Natalya possesses all the technical ability to neutralize Janus' scheme or to destroy all computer records with the GoldenEye As one who survived a mass murder, this lovely beauty is suddenly a marked woman.\n\nJames Bond investigates the theft of the control disk for the GoldenEye satellite. His investigation leads to an organization of arms dealers Janus and the reappearance of someone from Bond's past. James Bond must deal with betrayal of his old friend Alec Trevelyan (006) gone rogue, from using a satellite GoldenEye against London to cause a global financial meltdown\n\nWhy I also love this movie to death beside the action is because of the great villains who created evil characters. Such as: Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006), Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp: A Georgian lust murderer, Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko: A computer programmer.\n\nIt was filmed in beautiful locations in Puerto Rico, Russia, England, UK and in the France.\n\nThe movie has a lot of insane hard-core action (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), The stunts are completely insane in scale (bungee jumping in - Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility a stunt man performed that stunt in the opening scene.) Bond with a motorcycle jumps on a plane and catches it. Bond drives a tank in Russia for the first time and he demolishes even police cars that was excellent scene. Bond a stuntman jumps out of the window in Russia. Alec Trevelyan's train depot - exploding train. The epic climatic fight on the end of the movie between Bond and Trevelyan in his secret Goldeneye satellite control dish in Cuba in which Bond drops Trevelyan out of dish beautiful and really crazy stunt performance.\n\nI love the soundtracks in this movie: Goldeneye by Tina Turner and The Experience of Love by Éric Serra. I just love everything about this movie from the actions, to the heroes, to the villains from acting everything abut this movie I just love so much.\n\nGoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.\n\n10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":242005,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.\n\nI'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get's bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction from Martin Campbell. The stunts are completely insane in scale in this movie and really dangerous.\n\nMusic score is by Éric Serra, the title song is GoldenEye performed by Tina Turner. GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond: Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.\n\nStyle and sophistication are in abundance - - "The name's Bond. James Bond." \n\nGoldeneye's female characters are honestly beautiful with particular techniques. The bad one is Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an ex-Soviet fighter pilot who tranquilly smokes big cigars and knocks off her victims with her 'killer thighs.' In one scene, she challenges Bond's legendary Aston Martin DB5 to a wild road race outside Monte Carlo with her red Ferrari: in another she was so smart that she snatches a top-secret helicopter from under the noses of the French navy. \n\nIzabella Scorupco is a great and the finest Bond girl, the irresistible Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) who 'tastes like strawberries.' Natalya possesses all the technical ability to neutralize Janus' scheme or to destroy all computer records with the GoldenEye As one who survived a mass murder, this lovely beauty is suddenly a marked woman.\n\nJames Bond investigates the theft of the control disk for the GoldenEye satellite. His investigation leads to an organization of arms dealers Janus and the reappearance of someone from Bond's past. James Bond must deal with betrayal of his old friend Alec Trevelyan (006) gone rogue, from using a satellite GoldenEye against London to cause a global financial meltdown\n\nWhy I also love this movie to death beside the action is because of the great villains who created evil characters. Such as: Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006), Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp: A Georgian lust murderer, Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko: A computer programmer.\n\nIt was filmed in beautiful locations in Puerto Rico, Russia, England, UK and in the France.\n\nThe movie has a lot of insane hard-core action (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), The stunts are completely insane in scale (bungee jumping in - Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility a stunt man performed that stunt in the opening scene.) Bond with a motorcycle jumps on a plane and catches it. Bond drives a tank in Russia for the first time and he demolishes even police cars that was excellent scene. Bond a stuntman jumps out of the window in Russia. Alec Trevelyan's train depot - exploding train. The epic climatic fight on the end of the movie between Bond and Trevelyan in his secret Goldeneye satellite control dish in Cuba in which Bond drops Trevelyan out of dish beautiful and really crazy stunt performance.\n\nI love the soundtracks in this movie: Goldeneye by Tina Turner and The Experience of Love by Éric Serra. I just love everything about this movie from the actions, to the heroes, to the villains from acting everything abut this movie I just love so much.\n\nGoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.\n\n10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":242005,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the most part, and with the help of Ewan McGregor who plays an alcoholic, grown-up version of The Shining's Danny Torrence, they pull it off.\n\nWhile Doctor Sleep is a rather drawn-out and, mostly, slowish-moving film, it still has enough to it, to not lose one's attention. The story-line is solid and engaging, although those unfamiliar with the book and looking for outright horror and gore, will find little satisfaction. There are a couple of scenes which can be construed as "horrific", but in my opinion, Doctor Sleep is not really a "horror flick" by definition. To me, it is more like an intense drama about good vs evil, with a couple of well-done 'end-of-life' scenes thrown in. :)\n\nWhat I most enjoyed about it, is that in this day and age where practically every story ever has already been made into a movie, this one's plot was just a bit off the beaten path and came across as slightly new and original in its approach, while still pretty seamlessly tying it in to the well-known classic: The Shining.\n\nIf I had to add one con, it would be a somewhat minor one, in that, at times, the girl who plays Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who also possesses 'the shining', and who can communicate with Danny, delivers her lines in almost a stone-like manner, and at other times as if she is rapidly reading. It occurred one too many times, and I found that it took me out of the movie for just a bit.\n\nWhile good, the scenes leading up to the ending are a bit predictable, and the 'showdown' (remember, good vs. evil) leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, however, I can live with it, seeing as Rebecca Ferguson saves it by just being in it, and King and the creators do their best to come full circle. In short, like the entire film itself, it is satisfying-enough to where one can feel as if watching it, was time well spent.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To me, it is more like an intense drama about good vs evil, with a couple of well-done 'end-of-life' scenes thrown in. :)\n\nWhat I most enjoyed about it, is that in this day and age where practically every story ever has already been made into a movie, this one's plot was just a bit off the beaten path and came across as slightly new and original in its approach, while still pretty seamlessly tying it in to the well-known classic: The Shining.\n\nIf I had to add one con, it would be a somewhat minor one, in that, at times, the girl who plays Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who also possesses 'the shining', and who can communicate with Danny, delivers her lines in almost a stone-like manner, and at other times as if she is rapidly reading. It occurred one too many times, and I found that it took me out of the movie for just a bit.\n\nWhile good, the scenes leading up to the ending are a bit predictable, and the 'showdown' (remember, good vs. evil) leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, however, I can live with it, seeing as Rebecca Ferguson saves it by just being in it, and King and the creators do their best to come full circle. In short, like the entire film itself, it is satisfying-enough to where one can feel as if watching it, was time well spent.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT2H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A mixture of fact and fiction often blurs the tedious factual parts with outlandish falsehoods to make the show more exciting as a whole. Therefore it can often be difficult to engage yourself to view it as fact as there are a large number of scenes which appear to be grandstanding for the viewers.\n\nDespite the above, the series is actually an exciting drama with some occasional comedy moments. It's certainly worth a viewing. The acting itself appears great, however it's difficult to know how good the acting is considering we're unaware whether the actors are portraying the Ingrams directly or whether there have been things added.\n\nThe reason for the 7/10 is not due to the production, excitement or directing, it is due to the script. I am slightly perplexed as to why the script has been written to feel empathy towards Charles Ingram. Although the wife was responsible for pushing Charles, he has surprisingly been made to look the innocent party, this is despite Charles committing insurance fraud before the quiz show fraud. So why has the script been written to make us feel empathetic?\n\nOverall the show is well worth the watch. It's exciting, gripping and interesting. Would really recommend, however most certainly take everything with a pinch of salt - it's not all fact!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5919,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A mixture of fact and fiction often blurs the tedious factual parts with outlandish falsehoods to make the show more exciting as a whole. Therefore it can often be difficult to engage yourself to view it as fact as there are a large number of scenes which appear to be grandstanding for the viewers.\n\nDespite the above, the series is actually an exciting drama with some occasional comedy moments. It's certainly worth a viewing. The acting itself appears great, however it's difficult to know how good the acting is considering we're unaware whether the actors are portraying the Ingrams directly or whether there have been things added.\n\nThe reason for the 7/10 is not due to the production, excitement or directing, it is due to the script. I am slightly perplexed as to why the script has been written to feel empathy towards Charles Ingram. Although the wife was responsible for pushing Charles, he has surprisingly been made to look the innocent party, this is despite Charles committing insurance fraud before the quiz show fraud. So why has the script been written to make us feel empathetic?\n\nOverall the show is well worth the watch. It's exciting, gripping and interesting. Would really recommend, however most certainly take everything with a pinch of salt - it's not all fact!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5919,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After all its from producer Sam Raimi 'Evil Dead , Don't Breath' just like the movie poster said . Well I will put it this way after watching this horror film I really had an 'Unstoppable urge' to go all Walking Tall ,Joe- Don- Baker ....Buford Pusser with my Old Hickory Stick; and commence smashing ever Living Daylights out of the Blu-ray &amp; case and by doing so establish some sense of satisfaction to the fact of spending $28.00 and pre-ordering this film.\n\nDirected by Nicolas Pesce . Screenplay by Nicolas Pesce. Written by Nicolas Pesce. I would really like to summon the ghost of Shakma at this point and introduce Skakma to the fine fatheaded Mr. Nicolas Pesce in formatt of locking the both is a small closet together. My money is on Shakma .\n\nI all seriousness The acting of the cast is actually quite strong during certain moments.Andrea Riseborough as Detective Muldoon was excellent . Betty Gilpin was as lovelyand talented as ever. By far the best actor here is Lin Shaye as Mrs. Matheson, who does her best with the little screen time that she is given.\n\nI issue with this remake is , there are few things I hate more in a horror film than jump scares. They have never been scary. There is a stark difference between being scared and startled. Jump scares can be startling. They can take you off guard for a brief moment or two, but after that initial shock, you no longer feel terror, because you have been released. A loud sound effect accompanied with a weird image on screen can be startling. Being scared is feeling downright uncomfortable, uneasy even.The Grudge is not scary. It can be startling, which to me, is annoying. It seemed as if there was a jump scare every other minute in this movie and after a while, it was insanely predictable as to when a jump scare would happen. basically the movie left me with an uncomfortable urge to just chew on 300 mg aspirin so I wouldn't go into cardiac arrest.\n\nAll in all, 2020's The Grudge was just OK and did have some effective horror that draws out its sense of impending doom with subtle artistry and then pops its audience with a bit of violence or gore to get a rise out of them. 6.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After all its from producer Sam Raimi 'Evil Dead , Don't Breath' just like the movie poster said . Well I will put it this way after watching this horror film I really had an 'Unstoppable urge' to go all Walking Tall ,Joe- Don- Baker ....Buford Pusser with my Old Hickory Stick; and commence smashing ever Living Daylights out of the Blu-ray &amp; case and by doing so establish some sense of satisfaction to the fact of spending $28.00 and pre-ordering this film.\n\nDirected by Nicolas Pesce . Screenplay by Nicolas Pesce. Written by Nicolas Pesce. I would really like to summon the ghost of Shakma at this point and introduce Skakma to the fine fatheaded Mr. Nicolas Pesce in formatt of locking the both is a small closet together. My money is on Shakma .\n\nI all seriousness The acting of the cast is actually quite strong during certain moments.Andrea Riseborough as Detective Muldoon was excellent . Betty Gilpin was as lovelyand talented as ever. By far the best actor here is Lin Shaye as Mrs. Matheson, who does her best with the little screen time that she is given.\n\nI issue with this remake is , there are few things I hate more in a horror film than jump scares. They have never been scary. There is a stark difference between being scared and startled. Jump scares can be startling. They can take you off guard for a brief moment or two, but after that initial shock, you no longer feel terror, because you have been released. A loud sound effect accompanied with a weird image on screen can be startling. Being scared is feeling downright uncomfortable, uneasy even.The Grudge is not scary. It can be startling, which to me, is annoying. It seemed as if there was a jump scare every other minute in this movie and after a while, it was insanely predictable as to when a jump scare would happen. basically the movie left me with an uncomfortable urge to just chew on 300 mg aspirin so I wouldn't go into cardiac arrest.\n\nAll in all, 2020's The Grudge was just OK and did have some effective horror that draws out its sense of impending doom with subtle artistry and then pops its audience with a bit of violence or gore to get a rise out of them. 6.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I would strongly encourage you to seek this one out, you'll be glad you did.\n\n8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to Bank (of Marquis)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36745,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Vince Vaughn just blows it out the waters with an actually heart felt performance, This isn't just a sly comedy but a heart felt family drama where one ordinary man has to come to terms with an unordinary situation and Vaughn does it well and with great help from his co-stars. Definitely worth at least one watch, if not for Vince Vaughn then definitely watch it for Chris Pratt because even if this movie isn't just a straight odd ball comedy it's definitely got it's funny moments and all mostly revolving around Chris Pratt and his Attorney at Law bit.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75937,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Vince Vaughn just blows it out the waters with an actually heart felt performance, This isn't just a sly comedy but a heart felt family drama where one ordinary man has to come to terms with an unordinary situation and Vaughn does it well and with great help from his co-stars. Definitely worth at least one watch, if not for Vince Vaughn then definitely watch it for Chris Pratt because even if this movie isn't just a straight odd ball comedy it's definitely got it's funny moments and all mostly revolving around Chris Pratt and his Attorney at Law bit.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75937,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film has made me grateful to be alive and that we still have people in cinema like Boyle who understands the power and beauty of the medium.

Their films are extremely varied (ranging from dark comedies to westerns or thrillers) and that is why people rank their films so differently according to their own genre preferences. What these films tend to have in common is that they focus on an unfortunate main character (the Coen brothers don't seem to be too interested in successful characters) and they also include a lot of quirky characters. The Coens are also great at writing interesting characters that despite being unpleasant at times still capture our attention, and they also include a lot of dark and sharp humor. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films where we are forced to follow an unpleasant guy in the course of a week and somehow hope he recovers and achieves his goal. This is a film that you probably enjoy more when you think about it once it's over or on a rewatch because it's philosophical and sad, but rewarding none the less if you stick through it. It is also open to many readings and interpretations. You can think of this as being an honest film about someone who doesn't achieve his dreams. We've been saturated with so many films that focus on following our dreams and never giving up on them, but it is rare to see a film focusing on someone who doesn't achieve them. Like Llewyn, we sometimes throw away other possibilities for success because we are too blinded on pursuing our own thing. That is exactly what happens here (and in this way it differs from A Serious Man where the main character suffers misfortune from things that he can't control). Llewyn could've listened and taken good advice, but he's so narcissistic and blinded by his own ambition that he misses several good opportunities. Another way you can read this film, and this is the one that worked best for me, is that Llewyn is learning to cope with the loss of his partner. He was a better singer when he wasn't on his own and now that he has lost his partner he doesn't seem to know what to do next. He is a tortured artist struggling to cope with grief. It's as if the Coens were admitting that they wouldn't know how to make films without each other. They inspire one another and that is where their success relies. Perhaps if something would happen to one of them they would feel like Llewyn, lost and unable to move on. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game.\n\nThe film takes place in the course of one week as we follow a struggling folk singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaacs) across Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. He has recently released a solo album that isn't selling. With no money and no apartment, Llewyn spends his days jumping from couch to couch at friends houses while performing small gigs at local Cafes. One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean's (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isn't really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way he's his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing. \n\nI'm not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. It's an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film. The soundtrack is also a lot of fun to listen too and Isaacs has a great voice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Their films are extremely varied (ranging from dark comedies to westerns or thrillers) and that is why people rank their films so differently according to their own genre preferences. What these films tend to have in common is that they focus on an unfortunate main character (the Coen brothers don't seem to be too interested in successful characters) and they also include a lot of quirky characters. The Coens are also great at writing interesting characters that despite being unpleasant at times still capture our attention, and they also include a lot of dark and sharp humor. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films where we are forced to follow an unpleasant guy in the course of a week and somehow hope he recovers and achieves his goal. This is a film that you probably enjoy more when you think about it once it's over or on a rewatch because it's philosophical and sad, but rewarding none the less if you stick through it. It is also open to many readings and interpretations. You can think of this as being an honest film about someone who doesn't achieve his dreams. We've been saturated with so many films that focus on following our dreams and never giving up on them, but it is rare to see a film focusing on someone who doesn't achieve them. Like Llewyn, we sometimes throw away other possibilities for success because we are too blinded on pursuing our own thing. That is exactly what happens here (and in this way it differs from A Serious Man where the main character suffers misfortune from things that he can't control). Llewyn could've listened and taken good advice, but he's so narcissistic and blinded by his own ambition that he misses several good opportunities. Another way you can read this film, and this is the one that worked best for me, is that Llewyn is learning to cope with the loss of his partner. He was a better singer when he wasn't on his own and now that he has lost his partner he doesn't seem to know what to do next. He is a tortured artist struggling to cope with grief. It's as if the Coens were admitting that they wouldn't know how to make films without each other. They inspire one another and that is where their success relies. Perhaps if something would happen to one of them they would feel like Llewyn, lost and unable to move on. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game.\n\nThe film takes place in the course of one week as we follow a struggling folk singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaacs) across Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. He has recently released a solo album that isn't selling. With no money and no apartment, Llewyn spends his days jumping from couch to couch at friends houses while performing small gigs at local Cafes. One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean's (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isn't really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way he's his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing. \n\nI'm not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. It's an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film.

One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean's (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isn't really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way he's his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing. \n\nI'm not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. It's an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film. The soundtrack is also a lot of fun to listen too and Isaacs has a great voice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was hoping to learn more about him after watching this movie. Unfortunately, I knew more about Andy Kaufman than this movie told me. As a biography, this movie wasn't so great. It didn't go into much about Andy's childhood or what he was like outside of work. Rather, it showed most of the skits and performances that Andy has done throughout his life, most of which you could learn about on MTV specials.\n\nThe acting was well done, especially by the star Jim Carrey. Carrey played Andy Kaufman. This was by far the best acting job I have ever seen Jim Carrey perform. One could argue he did a better job at Andy Kaufman's skits than Andy Kaufman himself did.\n\nThe plot and storyline, if not looking from a biography point of view, was very interesting. The best thing, in my opinion about the movie is learning more about how Andy Kaufman met his girlfriend, the scenes from Taxi and his wrestling career. I didn't care much for Tony Clifton but, as the movie states, he is a different person from Andy Kaufman all together.\n\nI'd say this movie is worth a rent, don't go to theaters to see it. Jim Carrey deserves an Academy Award for his performance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":125723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was hoping to learn more about him after watching this movie. Unfortunately, I knew more about Andy Kaufman than this movie told me. As a biography, this movie wasn't so great. It didn't go into much about Andy's childhood or what he was like outside of work. Rather, it showed most of the skits and performances that Andy has done throughout his life, most of which you could learn about on MTV specials.\n\nThe acting was well done, especially by the star Jim Carrey. Carrey played Andy Kaufman. This was by far the best acting job I have ever seen Jim Carrey perform. One could argue he did a better job at Andy Kaufman's skits than Andy Kaufman himself did.\n\nThe plot and storyline, if not looking from a biography point of view, was very interesting. The best thing, in my opinion about the movie is learning more about how Andy Kaufman met his girlfriend, the scenes from Taxi and his wrestling career. I didn't care much for Tony Clifton but, as the movie states, he is a different person from Andy Kaufman all together.\n\nI'd say this movie is worth a rent, don't go to theaters to see it. Jim Carrey deserves an Academy Award for his performance.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":125723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a wonderful film to see, especially if you're a true romantic at heart.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45155,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Formerly a bell hop at a hotel, and born out of a relatively poor, but religiously devout home, George is spellbound by how the upper crust live. As he starts to climb the social ladder he becomes besotted with his cousin's beautiful partner, Angela Vickers. While at the same time neglecting his girlfriend and mother of his unborn child, Alice Tripp. The outcome of George's confused emotions will have devastating effects on everyone involved...\n\nA Place In The Sun is one of those revered, yet seemingly divisive classic pictures that I believe deserves every bit of praise heaped upon it. Based on the Theodore Dreiser novel, An American Tragedy {and the Patrick Kearney play}, it's a slow simmering piece that boasts technical greatness and a class division script that is intriguingly shrouded by a real life sad story. The book and subsequent film versions {Josef von Sternberg filmed an adaptation in 1931} are working from the real case of Chester Gillette and his girlfriend, Grace Brown. To expand further would result in major spoilers but it's a case that is readily available to anyone with internet access. Here with this adaptation, director George Stevens {sublime direction} has gathered all the things available to him and crafted a Gothic, almost dreamy, classic amongst classics.

Formerly a bell hop at a hotel, and born out of a relatively poor, but religiously devout home, George is spellbound by how the upper crust live. As he starts to climb the social ladder he becomes besotted with his cousin's beautiful partner, Angela Vickers. While at the same time neglecting his girlfriend and mother of his unborn child, Alice Tripp. The outcome of George's confused emotions will have devastating effects on everyone involved...\n\nA Place In The Sun is one of those revered, yet seemingly divisive classic pictures that I believe deserves every bit of praise heaped upon it. Based on the Theodore Dreiser novel, An American Tragedy and the Patrick Kearney play, it's a slow simmering piece that boasts technical greatness and a class division script that is intriguingly shrouded by a real life sad story. The book and subsequent film versions Josef von Sternberg filmed an adaptation in 1931 are working from the real case of Chester Gillette and his girlfriend, Grace Brown. To expand further would result in major spoilers but it's a case that is readily available to anyone with internet access. Here with this adaptation, director George Stevens sublime direction has gathered all the things available to him and crafted a Gothic, almost dreamy, classic amongst classics. The source, and Sternberg's take on the novel may well be more stark and grimly oppressive, but this has such high cinema values it positively begs you to invest your very being with it.\n\nThe story behind the scenes is itself worthy of a movie, Stevens clashing constantly with Montgomery Clift Eastman and Shelley Winters Tripp, Clift because he would only take motivation from his personal coach, Mira Rostova, and Winters because Stevens had never wanted her cast in the first place!

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju.

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu.

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Transporter 2</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Frank Martin (J. Statham) najbolji je u poslu. Bivši operativac specijalnih snaga sada samoga sebe iznajmljuje kao plaćenog trasportera koji prevozi razna "dobra", ljude ili robu. Bivši pripadnik specijalnih snaga, Frank Martin (Jason Statham), radi kao prijevoznik i za poveću je sumu novca spreman prevesti bilo što bilo gdje, a njegov je novi posao samo na prvi pogled bezopasan. Naime, Martinov je zadatak voziti Jacka Billingsa (Hunter Clary), sina utjecajnog i važnog političara. I dok Martin vozi Jacka na pregled kod doktora, ne sluti što se sprema. Doktor je zapravo Dimitri (Jason Flemyng), ruski agent i pripadnik terorističke organizacije, koja otima Jacka i traži otkupninu. Uznemireni roditelji, spremni na sve za dobrobit svog sina, plaćaju otkupninu ne znajući da tek sada počinje njihova prava noćna mora. Naime, mladiću je ubrizgan smrtonosni virus kojim teroristi žele zaraziti njegova oca, nadajući se kako će ga on dalje prenijeti ostalim političarima na kongresu koji se uskoro održava. Kako su teroristi pripremili savršeni plan kojim krivnju žele prenijeti na Martina, njemu ostaje malo vremena da pronađe protuotrov i dokaže vlastitu nevinost.</desc>

What starts off as a routine assignment changes on September 11, 2012. When a group of insurgents breach the Embassy and attempt to kill the US Ambassador, Jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision. Follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help their fellow soldiers. I was looking forward to watching this, but I was also a little worried at the same time. The story is interesting and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it was directed by Michael Bay. For that reason I was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to. Overall, not just a surprisingly good Michael Bay movie, a good movie period. I give this a high B+.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I give this a high B+.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was nothing truly spectacular or exciting to give it an 8 (but nothing truly spectacular happens in the book either, so the movie couldn't really change that), but nothing terrible/poor script/poor acting, which you usually find a bit of in a 6 or 6.5 stars.

It was well scripted, the filming was fantastic, and the acting was good - it was a very pleasant movie. I read the book, so I knew what the plot was about, so no surprises there (although I wish it included one detail that was in the book about the shooting). There was nothing truly spectacular or exciting to give it an 8 (but nothing truly spectacular happens in the book either, so the movie couldn't really change that), but nothing terrible/poor script/poor acting, which you usually find a bit of in a 6 or 6.5 stars. I saw it in the theater and it was the perfect "girls night out" movie. Also good for mother/daughter. Otherwise, wouldn't pay $10 to see it. It would be a great rental - see once and return.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you have a desire to get enjoyment from a film without becoming emotionally invested in a story that lasts 3 movies or longer with hints and clues popping up all over the place eluding to a next installment of whatever series, (and enjoy comedy of all types) then I would recommend this highly. Not artistic, not over done, not offensive to the degree some say, just straight up good comedy. Waaay better than the terrible Seth Rogen movie "the Neighbors".

"Born on the Fourth of July" is an absorbing piece of work, based on a true story, about Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a gung-ho Marine-turned-war-protester. We first meet Kovic as an all-American boy as strong in his faith as he is in his will to succeed. After high school he proudly joins the Marines, hoping he'll be shipped to Vietnam to stop the spread of communism. But the barbarities of war, including civilian casualties, friendly fire and a paralyzing bullet through the chest, gradually turn him against the conflict. Director Oliver Stone's method of telling Kovic's story over a period of several years is highly effective and convincing. Cruise is at his best as Kovic, portraying a wide range of emotions and developing apathy with the viewer. The audience feels what he feels, from confusion on the battlefield to the terror of being paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nNow for the bad news. The picture is overly political, with Stone once again (and unnecessarily) casting Republicans as the bad guys and Democrats as the good guys (seemingly ignoring that the Dems initially sent the troops to 'Nam). The film also takes a while to build up steam, and the all-American life of the pre-Marine Kovic seems a little too perfect to be believable. Obviously a story such as this requires adequate screen time, but the 145 minutes is slightly drawn out, particularly toward the end. And although one of its central themes is the opposition to the war that greeted returning vets, the genesis and rationale of that opposition are not adequately explored.\n\nAs a whole, however, "Born of the Fourth of July" is recommended. Kovic's biography and Stone's masterful storytelling are a perfect match. It's not your typical war movie.

Kovic's biography and Stone's masterful storytelling are a perfect match. It's not your typical war movie. In fact, it's not your typical movie, period.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100013,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT2H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Turns out, when one is near Solaris, one tends to see dead people--or duplicates thereof. In Kelvin's case, this would be a doppelganger of his deceased wife, Rheya (McElhone), which seems to have Rheya's personality traits and memories.\n\nI had heard that Solaris was excruciatingly slow and, consequently, unbearably boring, but I didn't quite agree. I understood that many shots were included or extended to set the mood, and to illustrate thought and memory, and it was all visually interesting. I could see, for example, where Soderbergh showed his love for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with lingering shots of Clooney in an astronaut's helmet, patterns of light reflected on its glass. However I would have traded the extra hour of atmospherics for a deeper exploration of the intriguing questions the premise raised. When we say we love someone, are we saying we love the sum of the person's characteristics? Were we to lose our loved one, would a twin with the same likes, dislikes, and quirks be a suitable replacement? Would you want to live on in the memories of your friends and family or, as Woody Allen prefers, to live on in your apartment? This film seems less interested in delving into these mysteries than it is in portraying grief and subjective memory. Valid objectives, but Solaris left me wanting to see an episode of the similarly themed Caprica (of which I've only seen the pilot movie).\n\nWhy you should see it You never got over that crush you developed on Clooney during his tenure on ER. You're in the mood for a visual poem of love and loss. You enjoy any movie set in outer space. You're the founder of Jeremy Davies/Dr. Faraday Fan Club.\n\nWhy you should avoid it Star Trek: The Next Generation was set in outer space too. Pick an episode and it will lead you through a debate of life's big questions, in half the time.\n\n--from my review at www.1man365movies.com"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":79670,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Turns out, when one is near Solaris, one tends to see dead people--or duplicates thereof. In Kelvin's case, this would be a doppelganger of his deceased wife, Rheya (McElhone), which seems to have Rheya's personality traits and memories.\n\nI had heard that Solaris was excruciatingly slow and, consequently, unbearably boring, but I didn't quite agree. I understood that many shots were included or extended to set the mood, and to illustrate thought and memory, and it was all visually interesting. I could see, for example, where Soderbergh showed his love for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with lingering shots of Clooney in an astronaut's helmet, patterns of light reflected on its glass. However I would have traded the extra hour of atmospherics for a deeper exploration of the intriguing questions the premise raised. When we say we love someone, are we saying we love the sum of the person's characteristics? Were we to lose our loved one, would a twin with the same likes, dislikes, and quirks be a suitable replacement? Would you want to live on in the memories of your friends and family or, as Woody Allen prefers, to live on in your apartment? This film seems less interested in delving into these mysteries than it is in portraying grief and subjective memory. Valid objectives, but Solaris left me wanting to see an episode of the similarly themed Caprica (of which I've only seen the pilot movie).\n\nWhy you should see it You never got over that crush you developed on Clooney during his tenure on ER. You're in the mood for a visual poem of love and loss. You enjoy any movie set in outer space. You're the founder of Jeremy Davies/Dr. Faraday Fan Club.\n\nWhy you should avoid it Star Trek: The Next Generation was set in outer space too. Pick an episode and it will lead you through a debate of life's big questions, in half the time.\n\n--from my review at www.1man365movies.com","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":79670,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's not bad, but it could be much better. Seemingly, it was a independent production. It means, it received not a single cent from government or ministry. Still, it seems this movie is made for purpose of participation in international festivals, shows,etc. Original Serbian viewer, can easily see something is artificial in this movie. Scenes from the street, from the pub, everything looks like that, without real life. So gloomy and dark. For sure, present-day Serbia is not the country of darkness and pessimists. Serbian people are mainly optimistic and cheerful, merry. Of course, in bigger cities like Belgrade, something like that could happen. New, young actor, Ljubomir Bulajic, is somehow, IMHO, mismatch to the role. He is not bad, but still something is missing, because his lines are limited by limited scenario. His face is vivid, nice, but still something is missing. Probably, original scenario had to be shortened because financial limitations. So, it is not actor'sfault by any means. Another role is one of Milena Zivanovic. Through the movie, camera dislike her. Her face is sad and gloom, and too expressionless. Perhaps, it was original idea? Too late to know for sure, as, perhaps, the damage is done. Technically, many scenes in the movie are too dark. Unrealistic for real, light and optimistic city of Belgrade. Older artists, Svetozar Cvetkovic and Danica Maksimovic, are more natural, and they played their roles much better, with excellence. So better, it left new artists (Bulajic and Zivanovic) looking like real rookies. Sexual intercourse between Cvetkovic and Zivanovic is pictured unpleasant and needlessly semi-violent. But, perhaps it was the intention of director? We will never know for sure. After all, the movie is too short. Story required at least 20 to 30 minutes more. Thats why the movie seems bit crippled and too short. Scenes in ''bordel'' are highly unrealistic. Prostitution is illegal in Serbia, and it was not clearly shown. I gave ''4'' for this movie. It is not a bad, but surely, looked to me like unfinished and somehow wrong. Like, it not a real Serbian movie, more like cross between Czech and German. Less Slavic and more Germanic feeling prevailed in this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of the most pleasant surprises of last year, it was very nice to see that Saulnier managed to gather up a follow-up in a relatively quick time – the gap from festival run to general release date notwithstanding. Green Room continues the vein of comically inept people in violent situations, but it's too crowded and lacks the subversiveness that made Blue Ruin so riveting. More characters means more bloodshed, but it uses that a crutch to get easy thrills rather than spending time getting us invested. Nevertheless, on concept alone it's destined for cult status, but lets hope Saulnier has a better idea up his sleeve next. \n\nSet in a day or two on the frugal tour of a punk band – they appear to be entirely fueled on stealing gas from other cars – including Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner and Joe Coe, they're very young, semi-talented, with a modest following but very little prospects. They're just in it for the thrill of the moment onstage. From a tip of a journalist after a gig is cancelled, they play a show at a neo-nazi venue just to get by. They tease the crowd with anti- white-supremacist lyrics, but they're in no real danger until one of the band members accidentally stumbles upon a murder in the bar's green room. They're held hostage, helped by a friend of the deceased played by Imogen Poots, until it becomes clear that the supremacist's only option – lead by Patrick Stewart – is to leave no witnesses and frame the band for everything. Cue a relentless bloodbath and a grudging cleanup. \n\nWhile the first gore scene is certainly stomach churning, the film regrettably relies on a palpable sense of dread over taunt tension. Its ultimate payoffs just have shock value rather than anything more gratifying, thereby drowning out its small comic elements. This is a very familiar brand of storytelling, and Saulnier definitely raises it from feeling pedestrian but it doesn't go much further than that. For one, I really wish he had shot it himself. While Blue Ruin has much more patience, Saulnier's own photography in his hands boasted more cinematic shots than the most expensive and lavish blockbusters. It was vivid and atmospheric. Instead of atmosphere, we get noise in Green Room. He trades the camera to Sean Porter, who did an otherwise great job with this year's Kumiko the Treasure Hunter, but it lacks the contrasts and focus to make it as effective despite the abundance of opportunities. \n\nThe film makes a wise choice to give every character a hint of humanity, including the supremacists, as this could have otherwise been a very unsympathetic batch of characters to follow. However, muddy motivations make it difficult to latch onto anybody when a few odd decisions are made. Their mutual efforts to outwit aren't too witty. The dialogue needed a lot of work, since it wasn't interested in getting deep under the character's skin, or mostly shredded to give the actors more breathing room. It's still an engaging film at least. Blue Ruin's lead Macon Blair is an understated highlight, while Patrick Stewart clearly channels Heisenberg without forcing it. Anton Yelchin and Alia Shawkat are the least likely punk rockers, but the latter makes it work by being the entrepreneurial boss while Yelchin's vulnerability makes him a natural underdog. Imogen Poots is usually irritating, but is only mildly irritating here. Unfortunately, Green Room runs thin the further it goes along, and severely lacks the potency that made Blue Ruin a treat. It's an average thriller, but an above average horror film.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110778,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Its been labelled stupid, loud, dumb and every other thing you can think of. Whilst I admit that the script aint hot and there's no real story in the film, the action is great, the special effects are brilliant, the film moves fast and provides a slambang rocking good ride. Im sorry that more films like this are not made. I love this film. When i saw it at the theatre, i was blown away (no pun intended). Bill paxton does a good job in the lead (yeah people have said that he is dull and that they should have found someone with more charisma. PUHLLLEASSSEEE). I'll watch this film a thousand times between now and the day I die. And for all the geniuses out there who call this film Crap. I hope you all get swept up in a windstorm, I really do.

This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the "old fashioned way" prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":664095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the "old fashioned way" prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":664095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The dialogue and over all atmosphere felt tacky and the acting didn't seem genuine. This was only the beginning though.\n\nGeostorm is filled with canned dialogue and clichés that will make you cringe. Most of the actors under perform and there's no real chemistry between the main actors.\n\nDuring the whole movie you feel like you're watching a movie that you've already seen and the tropes used are so in-your-face that you almost feel provoked.\n\nI was thinking about leaving several times during the movie but since I was with friends I decided to stay. During the climax of the movie several people in the audience were loudly mocking the movie and laughing at the absurdity of it all.\n\nEverything about Geostorm was a disaster. It was very predictable and preachy and the director actually made you feel dumb throughout most of the movie. The only OK thing was the CGI but even that felt re-used and tired.\n\nNobody should watch this movie. It's utterly bad and should be avoided at any cost. I don't even want to think about how much money was spent on this garbage","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Since it was a disaster movie I figured it would go well with the big screen and the 4D-effects.\n\nRight from start I felt that something was off. The dialogue and over all atmosphere felt tacky and the acting didn't seem genuine. This was only the beginning though.\n\nGeostorm is filled with canned dialogue and clichés that will make you cringe. Most of the actors under perform and there's no real chemistry between the main actors.\n\nDuring the whole movie you feel like you're watching a movie that you've already seen and the tropes used are so in-your-face that you almost feel provoked.\n\nI was thinking about leaving several times during the movie but since I was with friends I decided to stay. During the climax of the movie several people in the audience were loudly mocking the movie and laughing at the absurdity of it all.\n\nEverything about Geostorm was a disaster. It was very predictable and preachy and the director actually made you feel dumb throughout most of the movie. The only OK thing was the CGI but even that felt re-used and tired.\n\nNobody should watch this movie. It's utterly bad and should be avoided at any cost. I don't even want to think about how much money was spent on this garbage","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lets get one thing straight right now. If you're looking for a serious movie about cops v robbers a la Robert de Niro, Al Pacino or something similar this is not the place to come.\n\nIf on the other hand you want an action packed, leave your brain in the lobby, tongue in cheek zombie flick, with a side order of buddy-cops take on dastardly criminals thrown in then you aren't going to get much better than this.\n\nCops Mortis (Treat Williams) and Bigelow (Joe Piscopo) are on the trail of nutty old Vincent Price (unfortunately not given much screen time) bringing dead criminals back to life so they can carry out jewellery store robberies. Of course being dead already makes it a tad difficult for the police to kill them.\n\nMortis comes a cropper fairly early on, but worry not as he is soon resurrected with the regeneration machine found at the dodgy research company that they think might be connected with the crimes.\n\nThe only problem is Mortis now has only twelve hours to solve the case before he decomposes, so things move on at a fair old pace after this as the lads do battle with various zombies, and a Chinese butchers shop full of meat that comes back to life!\n\nGreat fun for fans of 'Braindead' or 'The Evil Dead' style horrors, and anyone else who wants a film that they don't have to take to seriously. Also stands up well to repeated viewing.\n\n8/10 I say, but judging by some of the other IMBD reviews others wouldn't (boring gits!)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7091,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Lets get one thing straight right now. If you're looking for a serious movie about cops v robbers a la Robert de Niro, Al Pacino or something similar this is not the place to come.\n\nIf on the other hand you want an action packed, leave your brain in the lobby, tongue in cheek zombie flick, with a side order of buddy-cops take on dastardly criminals thrown in then you aren't going to get much better than this.\n\nCops Mortis (Treat Williams) and Bigelow (Joe Piscopo) are on the trail of nutty old Vincent Price (unfortunately not given much screen time) bringing dead criminals back to life so they can carry out jewellery store robberies. Of course being dead already makes it a tad difficult for the police to kill them.\n\nMortis comes a cropper fairly early on, but worry not as he is soon resurrected with the regeneration machine found at the dodgy research company that they think might be connected with the crimes.\n\nThe only problem is Mortis now has only twelve hours to solve the case before he decomposes, so things move on at a fair old pace after this as the lads do battle with various zombies, and a Chinese butchers shop full of meat that comes back to life!\n\nGreat fun for fans of 'Braindead' or 'The Evil Dead' style horrors, and anyone else who wants a film that they don't have to take to seriously. Also stands up well to repeated viewing.\n\n8/10 I say, but judging by some of the other IMBD reviews others wouldn't (boring gits!)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7091,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Let me just WASH MY MOUTH OUT WITH BUCKSHOT FIRST! The sad state of Hollywood can be blamed directly on us as movie watchers. Keep watching this canned crap, and they will keep canning it.\n\nI will gladly take Makeup FX and costumes with seams and zippers any day, just for a little imagination.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183155,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Željan zarade, Grenvile smišlja razne nepromišljene planove za podsticanje kupaca da ostave što više novca, ali retko kad postiže očekivane rezultate. Liroju ne nedostaje ženske pažnje, a Grenvilovo udvaranje staroj ljubavi Mavis stalno ometa njena žestoko zaštitnička sestra Madž.

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta.

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">U epizodi koja se zbiva u stvarnome vremenu, ekipa mora naći hakera koji je upao u policijske servere. Rosa ima probleme u vezi. Hitchcock i Scully pokušavaju pripremiti savršene lazanje. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Željan zarade, Grenvile smišlja razne nepromišljene planove za podsticanje kupaca da ostave što više novca, ali retko kad postiže očekivane rezultate. Liroju ne nedostaje ženske pažnje, a Grenvilovo udvaranje staroj ljubavi Mavis stalno ometa njena žestoko zaštitnička sestra Madž. Tu je i uvek prisutna Crna Udovica, koja je takođe bacila oko na Grenvila, čini se.</desc>

Iako se međusobno odlično razumiju, vanjski svijet je za njih zagonetka. Srećom, Pejdž Dinin (Katharine McPhee) ima mladog sina koji će ih "prevesti" u vanjski svijet.

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">U epizodi koja se zbiva u stvarnome vremenu, ekipa mora naći hakera koji je upao u policijske servere. Rosa ima probleme u vezi. Hitchcock i Scully pokušavaju pripremiti savršene lazanje. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">U epizodi koja se zbiva u stvarnome vremenu, ekipa mora naći hakera koji je upao u policijske servere. Rosa ima probleme u vezi. Hitchcock i Scully pokušavaju pripremiti savršene lazanje. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Umoran od života u Emmitovoj sjeni, Ray je proćelav, debeljuškast socijalni radnik koji je silno ogorčen kartama koje su mu podijeljene, a za to okrivljuje brata. Njihovo bratsko suparništvo vodi ih na krivi put koji počinje sitnim krađama, ali ubrzo dovodi do ubistava, mafijaša i surovog natjecateljskog bridža. Sitno suparništvo između dvojice braće eskalira i donosi haos maloj minesotskoj zajednici.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Serija se temelji na istinitoj priči i prati genija Voltera O'Brajena (Elyes Gabel) i njegovog tima sjajnih čudesa koji se bore protiv složenih visokotehnoloških prijetnji modernog vremena. Tim čine: Tobi Kurtis (Eddie Kaye Thomas), fini bihevioralista; Hapi Kin (Jadyn Wong) vunderkind za mehaniku i Silvester Dod (Ari Stidham), odličan statističar. Iako se međusobno odlično razumiju, vanjski svijet je za njih zagonetka. Srećom, Pejdž Dinin (Katharine McPhee) ima mladog sina koji će ih "prevesti" u vanjski svijet. Svi pobjeđuju s ovim timom: svojom izuzetnom domišljatošću rješavaju nacionalne krize, pomažući sebi da se uklope u stvarni svijet.</desc>

Emmit Stussy, "kralj parkirališta Minnesote", zgodan je, samoostvareni mogul nekretnina sa savršenom porodicom, prava američka priča o uspjehu. Ray je više upozoravajuća priča. Umoran od života u Emmitovoj sjeni, Ray je proćelav, debeljuškast socijalni radnik koji je silno ogorčen kartama koje su mu podijeljene, a za to okrivljuje brata. Njihovo bratsko suparništvo vodi ih na krivi put koji počinje sitnim krađama, ali ubrzo dovodi do ubistava, mafijaša i surovog natjecateljskog bridža. Sitno suparništvo između dvojice braće eskalira i donosi haos maloj minesotskoj zajednici.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>
