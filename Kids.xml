And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Nakon Charliejeve smrti, milijarder Walden useljava se u kuću na plaži s Alanom i Jakeom. Depresivan, Walden se oslanja na Alana koji će ga trenirati. Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen) živi dobar život kao uspješan pisac džingla u primorskom dvorcu u Los Angelesu. Ovaj se život naglo zaustavlja kad se dosele njegov brat Alan i 10-godišnji nećak Jake. Sada, ne samo da se mora nositi s njima, već i s Rose, njegovom susjedom iz susjedstva i Bertom, njegovom sarkastičnom domaćicom.</desc>

The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning.

The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Since not every show that's a hit in America exports well to the UK ("Friends" gathered plenty of them over here, and "CSI: Insert Subtitle Here" has consistently been a key player for what used to be called Channel 5; on the other hand, "Murphy Brown" landed on stony soil when it was shown on BBC2, and don't get UK fans started on how "The West Wing" fares here), that's a good question. Fortunately, there is an answer. In fact, several...\n\n1. Germaine Greer, Janet Street-Porter, the editor of "Cosmopolitan" (UK edition) and the TV critics of "The Times" and "The Mirror" have all pooh-poohed it. Since I respect their opinions in the same way I admire Britney Spears purely for her music, this is pretty much a glowing recommendation.\n\n2. Never discount prior experience; just as many critics noted David Chase's work on "The Rockford Files" when "The Sopranos" started here (and never once gave due credit for that beloved '70s show to Stephen J.

Since not every show that's a hit in America exports well to the UK ("Friends" gathered plenty of them over here, and "CSI: Insert Subtitle Here" has consistently been a key player for what used to be called Channel 5; on the other hand, "Murphy Brown" landed on stony soil when it was shown on BBC2, and don't get UK fans started on how "The West Wing" fares here), that's a good question. Fortunately, there is an answer. In fact, several...\n\n1. Germaine Greer, Janet Street-Porter, the editor of "Cosmopolitan" (UK edition) and the TV critics of "The Times" and "The Mirror" have all pooh-poohed it. Since I respect their opinions in the same way I admire Britney Spears purely for her music, this is pretty much a glowing recommendation.\n\n2. Never discount prior experience; just as many critics noted David Chase's work on "The Rockford Files" when "The Sopranos" started here (and never once gave due credit for that beloved '70s show to Stephen J. Cannell and the late Roy Huggins, but that's another story), so creator Marc Cherry's years on "The Golden Girls" (another show that did well here) may have counted. And though I admit I've never liked her, the goodwill Teri Hatcher built up among viewers of both sexes from playing Lois Lane for four years cannot be overlooked.\n\n3. It strikes a major blow on behalf of those of us who don't give a rodent's rump about reality TV.\n\n4. It fills the "Melrose Place"/"Knots Landing"/primetime soap-sized hole that's been gaping for a while now, even down to having former cast members of same, and does it without wildly OTT acting (making it closer to "Knots Landing" in terms of temperament).\n\n5. The series wisely makes at least one of its main characters (Felicity Huffman's Lynette) seem like someone you could actually imagine meeting (key rule of TV: never make everyone too implausible OR too plausible - if everyone really wanted reality no one would have a TV.

I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some people : Julia Roberts in a romantic comedy could be pretty slushy stuff; but then again if you watch it wanting that sort of thing you're likely to be disappointed.  Yes, so it is romantic and even a bit slushy at times, but has a sharp script and fast pace which keep you amused 95% of the time.\n\nOne of the things which appealed to me was the way moments of melodrama were defused into comedy - check out the two girls' confrontation with an audience of women (gathered by the call "Catfight!") whose oohs and aahs forestall any emotional reaction we ourselves may have to the scene.\n\nSome of the camerawork is also more interesting than one might expect, with particularly powerful close-ups where one or two faces fill the screen. Julia Roberts' beauty comes through in a long shot which starts to look like a shampoo commercial: long curly hair spills around her head as she lies in despair on the floor (the public safety message being, don't ever sit with your back against a door which an irate ex-lover might wrench open at any minute); nevertheless, the proximity gives us an intimacy with her character we might otherwise miss.\n\nAnother effective shot of this kind (two heads on a pillow fill the screen) drives home the theme touched on here of the devastatingly attractive gay man who is made doubly so by his inaccessibility (as more fully explored in "Object of my Affection").  George (Rupert Everett) is a fantastic character whose sense of fun, wisdom, sensitivity and English accent make him every girls' ideal object for unrequited love (or maybe it's just me ).\n\nThe disappointing aspect for me was the film's final affirmation of sexist values and a rather superficial and one-sided view of "real" love - but you 'll have to watch it to see if you agree with me on that.  Basically in my opinion, some of the ending lacked the self-awareness and sharpness of the rest of the film.  However, overall I would recommend it for an amusing and sometimes clever 90 minutes of celluloid.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some people : Julia Roberts in a romantic comedy could be pretty slushy stuff; but then again if you watch it wanting that sort of thing you're likely to be disappointed.  Yes, so it is romantic and even a bit slushy at times, but has a sharp script and fast pace which keep you amused 95% of the time.\n\nOne of the things which appealed to me was the way moments of melodrama were defused into comedy - check out the two girls' confrontation with an audience of women (gathered by the call "Catfight!") whose oohs and aahs forestall any emotional reaction we ourselves may have to the scene.\n\nSome of the camerawork is also more interesting than one might expect, with particularly powerful close-ups where one or two faces fill the screen. Julia Roberts' beauty comes through in a long shot which starts to look like a shampoo commercial: long curly hair spills around her head as she lies in despair on the floor (the public safety message being, don't ever sit with your back against a door which an irate ex-lover might wrench open at any minute); nevertheless, the proximity gives us an intimacy with her character we might otherwise miss.\n\nAnother effective shot of this kind (two heads on a pillow fill the screen) drives home the theme touched on here of the devastatingly attractive gay man who is made doubly so by his inaccessibility (as more fully explored in "Object of my Affection").  George (Rupert Everett) is a fantastic character whose sense of fun, wisdom, sensitivity and English accent make him every girls' ideal object for unrequited love (or maybe it's just me ).\n\nThe disappointing aspect for me was the film's final affirmation of sexist values and a rather superficial and one-sided view of "real" love - but you 'll have to watch it to see if you agree with me on that.  Basically in my opinion, some of the ending lacked the self-awareness and sharpness of the rest of the film.  However, overall I would recommend it for an amusing and sometimes clever 90 minutes of celluloid.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban ('Y Tu Mama Tambien's Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.\n\nNaturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn't really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics. The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics. As 'Doctor Zhivago' proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life. \n\nAs noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way. I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion. The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role. That 'Shall We Dance?' will wind up doing far better at the box office than 'Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights' may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27105,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban ('Y Tu Mama Tambien's Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.\n\nNaturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn't really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics. The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics. As 'Doctor Zhivago' proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life. \n\nAs noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way. I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion. The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role. That 'Shall We Dance?' will wind up doing far better at the box office than 'Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights' may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27105,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lamenting the loss of tradition (she thinks Frosty the Snowman is a song about worshiping false idols) she crosses swords with the popular and laid back Father Flynn who takes a more liberal view seeing the need to keep up with the times.

Their chemistry is poor, which kills the film's remaining chance of becoming a romantic comedy.

The story is far too dull, slow and flat to be remotely entertaining. There is no joke. The relationship between Jennifer Aniston and Steve Zahn is forced and unconvincing. Their chemistry is poor, which kills the film's remaining chance of becoming a romantic comedy. The only character that shines is Woody Harrelson, but his scenes are few and far in between to make any positive impact on the snooze factor.\n\nIn summary, even Jennifer Aniston fans is unlikely to enjoy this film.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17193,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Franke želi tri teme koje opisuju Greendale - Čudno, Strastveno i Neprihvatljivo, ali njezini kolege se baš i ne slažu s tim. Abed kaže Frankie da je spreman učiti od nje i pomoći joj da skupa spase Greendale. U ulozi se pojavljuje i Ken Jeong.</desc>

Changova (Ken Jeong) audicija za kazališnu adaptaciju Karate Kida urodi iznenađujućim rezultatima. Annie ga priprema za tu audiciu, ali Wi-Fi ne radi pa ga Elroy mora popraviti. Abed mu pomaže. Problem je u tome što je u routeru ptičje gnijezdo. Ali kad je htio maknuti ptiće, Abed ga zaustavi, kaže mu da se mama neće vratiti ako je dirano u gnijezdo. Elroy kaže Peltonu da ne mogu maknuti ptiće, jer sami neće preživjeti. Pristane spasiti ptiće, no odbor kaže da je to previše gej od njega. Ipak naredi da se gnijezdo uništi, osim jednoga ptića… Sad Pelton istupa kao političar, no izbacuju ga iz odbora.</desc>

The plot sees a deeply dysfunctional family of strong-willed and vitriolic women coming back together in the wake of a family tragedy. Resentment, past hurts, bitterness and vitriol are the underlying themes as the family sits around the dinner table. I shan't say too much more than that – not because the plot is best left unknown (although it is) but more because there really isn't too much more actual plot to worry about and instead the film is more about the characters and a study of the family.\n\nIn some ways this is a bad thing and it does make the film feel long and rather lacking in a narrative drive. I can understand why many have found it dull and low on direction and focus but for me personally I thought that the strength brought about by this approach was just about enough to overcome the weaknesses inherent in it. That strength is simply in the way that it takes a very talented group of actresses, puts them together and gives them some really strong scenes to get their teeth into. Additionally, and I don't mean to be rude, but this group is of an age which Hollywood casting agents generally starts forgetting exists due to their age. As a result of this the film almost always engages in the moment or in any specific scene as we see instantly recognizable characters lash out at each other, playing out old patterns of hurt in a way that we are able to recognize them as "old patterns" even though we as viewers are here for the first time. So as a collection of scenes, the film is almost always working well – it is just when it has to come together that it doesn't do quite as well.\n\nDespite this it is great to watch the cast go at it. Streep is great as usual and is utterly convincing as someone so engrained in patterns of behavior and carrying so much pain in her that it has affected everything – OK the cancer and the "eating pain" stuff may make it a bit too obvious, but even still she is good at what she has to do. Roberts is not quite on that level here but is still very strong while Nicholson and Lewis do well with big supporting characters. Martindale may not be as big a name (or role) but those that watch Justified already know she has presence and she holds her own here really well.

The plot sees a deeply dysfunctional family of strong-willed and vitriolic women coming back together in the wake of a family tragedy. Resentment, past hurts, bitterness and vitriol are the underlying themes as the family sits around the dinner table. I shan't say too much more than that – not because the plot is best left unknown (although it is) but more because there really isn't too much more actual plot to worry about and instead the film is more about the characters and a study of the family.\n\nIn some ways this is a bad thing and it does make the film feel long and rather lacking in a narrative drive. I can understand why many have found it dull and low on direction and focus but for me personally I thought that the strength brought about by this approach was just about enough to overcome the weaknesses inherent in it. That strength is simply in the way that it takes a very talented group of actresses, puts them together and gives them some really strong scenes to get their teeth into. Additionally, and I don't mean to be rude, but this group is of an age which Hollywood casting agents generally starts forgetting exists due to their age. As a result of this the film almost always engages in the moment or in any specific scene as we see instantly recognizable characters lash out at each other, playing out old patterns of hurt in a way that we are able to recognize them as "old patterns" even though we as viewers are here for the first time. So as a collection of scenes, the film is almost always working well – it is just when it has to come together that it doesn't do quite as well.\n\nDespite this it is great to watch the cast go at it. Streep is great as usual and is utterly convincing as someone so engrained in patterns of behavior and carrying so much pain in her that it has affected everything – OK the cancer and the "eating pain" stuff may make it a bit too obvious, but even still she is good at what she has to do. Roberts is not quite on that level here but is still very strong while Nicholson and Lewis do well with big supporting characters. Martindale may not be as big a name (or role) but those that watch Justified already know she has presence and she holds her own here really well. The male cast are very much second fiddle but there are still good turns throughout from Cooper, Shepard, Cumberbatch, Mulroney and McGregor. The risk is that the cast feels too heavy with stars, but they are all so convincing that once they had been on screen for a little, I was more focused on the character than the career.\n\nAugust Osage County is one of many films getting hyped up around the awards period and as with many films it is not as perfectly brilliant as you'll be told it is.

O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), we see the inner workings of President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his closest advisors as they try and find the best way to end a potentially devastating showdown with the U.S.S.R. In October of 1962, the U.S., during a regular mission photographing Cuba, spotted a missile buildup by the Russians. The missiles were powerful enough to kill 80 million Americans with only 5 minutes of warning time. President Kennedy had to decide quickly what action to take. With his trusted aide Kenny O'Donnell and his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp), and others such as Robert McNamara, Adlai Stevenson, McGeorge Bundy, Dean Acheson, Dean Rusk, and many more, Kennedy needed to figure out the best course of action. If he allowed the Russians to aim these missiles at the U.S., the United States would be placed in a potentially deadly situation. If Kennedy allowed the military to attack the missiles and destroy them, what would Russia do as a response? If he waited too long, would Russia simply attack the U.S.? If he backed down and agreed to take down U.S. missiles in Turkey, would the U.S. then look weak to the rest of the world? For such a young President, Kennedy had a lot of tough decisions to make, in a short amount of time, with the world hanging in the balance. \n\nI wasn't alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis as it occurred, so seeing Thirteen Days was like having a history lesson at the same time as having great entertainment. Even though I knew that we didn't end up in World War III, there were a lot of things I didn't know. I won't go into any of the specifics, but I never fully understood how close we came to destroying the planet. The tensions of the time were brought out successfully by director Roger Donaldson. You could see and feel the sweat on all the major players as each minute ticked by. Bruce Greenwood did a tremendous job as the young President Kennedy, showing how Kennedy was strong enough to stand by his morals and values, even as his most trusted advisors were urging him to go to war. At the same time, Greenwood was able to portray Kennedy as someone who needed help and was able to turn to his brother for guidance. Kevin Costner did a good job as Kennedy's presidential aide. I especially liked his boston accent.  Costner was a strong personality that worked well with Greenwood and Steven Culp. I believed that the three of them were friends for 15 years and that they trusted each other with their own lives. Other acting standouts to me were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. \n\nEven running at almost two and a half hours, I was always at the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. Like I said before, I wasn't even born yet, nor was it something I ever learned about in school, so I had no idea what was going to happen. It was nice being able to get deep inside the mind of these important people during this crucial time. Of course, I have no idea if what was said during these meetings was actually said in real life, but I'd like to believe that at least the outcomes of the meetings were true. I'm a big fan of these kinds of dramatic films based on real life events. While being entertaining, they also have the ability to teach you about history. Reading about these situations in books isn't nearly as enjoyable as being able to watch them on screen. I think screenwriter David Self did a great job of bringing these real life events to life on the big screen. He made it historical but didn't bore you with too much talk or information. Along with Donaldson, he gave you what you needed to know, and let the actors bring you into the action.\n\n So overall, I thought Thirteen Days was a great film. Well acted, well directed, well written, nice musical score and very entertaining throughout. And if you happen to learn something along the way like I did, then even better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54862,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

With a cast which is more than able to add some heft to the 'human' side of the story - it was equally gratifying to see the 'synthetics' pull off the difficult balancing act between machine behavior and enough 'emotional' content to set the series up for some dramatic juxtapositions. Although there is a small level of "adult" content I think its use, given the use of technology in our own world, was both relevant and all too believable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36979,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Dekana Peltona (Jim Rash) zamole da rastegne istinu ne bi li bio imenovan prvim homoseksualcem ravnateljem odbora općinskoga koledža. Changova (Ken Jeong) audicija za kazališnu adaptaciju Karate Kida urodi iznenađujućim rezultatima. Annie ga priprema za tu audiciu, ali Wi-Fi ne radi pa ga Elroy mora popraviti. Abed mu pomaže. Problem je u tome što je u routeru ptičje gnijezdo. Ali kad je htio maknuti ptiće, Abed ga zaustavi, kaže mu da se mama neće vratiti ako je dirano u gnijezdo. Elroy kaže Peltonu da ne mogu maknuti ptiće, jer sami neće preživjeti. Pristane spasiti ptiće, no odbor kaže da je to previše gej od njega. Ipak naredi da se gnijezdo uništi, osim jednoga ptića… Sad Pelton istupa kao političar, no izbacuju ga iz odbora.</desc>

Ovo je sezona koja je dokazala da autori mogu dati još više u seriji ni o čemu, sezona koja je dala najbolje od najboljeg i u kojoj možete ''yada yada yada'' bilo što u životu.

Pierce Brosnan plays a better and more realistic 007 than he ever did in any actual Bond film, insofar as you can use the term realistic with a film like this. He seems to have aged well into this kind of role. Now maybe we should dump the dour and pretentious Craig and return to Brosnan as an older, but better and wiser agent On Her Majesty's Secret Service (just an idea folks). \n\nFor what this film intends to be, I think it succeeds very well, so I' rating it pretty highly, although ultimately there is nothing here to really make you think. If you're looking for a pretty relentless but not utterly ridiculous action movie, you might want to give this a shot.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64402,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Pierce Brosnan plays a better and more realistic 007 than he ever did in any actual Bond film, insofar as you can use the term realistic with a film like this. He seems to have aged well into this kind of role. Now maybe we should dump the dour and pretentious Craig and return to Brosnan as an older, but better and wiser agent On Her Majesty's Secret Service (just an idea folks). \n\nFor what this film intends to be, I think it succeeds very well, so I' rating it pretty highly, although ultimately there is nothing here to really make you think.

No one's ever done a movie about flowers before."","reviewBody":"After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction novel, "The Orchid Thief," for the screen. However, it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable, its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel, Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation, but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze, who had also directed "Being John Malkovich," returned to direct "Adaptation," the quirky, twisting, self-referential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film, '8½,' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration, 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.\n\nNicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, the lonely, insecure and socially awkward screenwriter who is hired to adapt "The Orchid Thief," written by Susan Orlean, who is portrayed by Meryl Streep. The novel itself concerns the story of John Laroche (played by Chris Cooper), a smug plant dealer who was arrested in 1994 for poaching rare orchids in the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. As Kaufman struggles to write the script, his troubles are compounded by the presence of his twin brother, Donald (also played by Nicolas Cage), who is Charlie's exact opposite: reckless, carefree, over-confident and perhaps even a bit dim. The script for 'Adaptation' darts back and forth between different moments in time, either chronicling Kaufman's screen writing exploits or Orlean's experiences in writing her novel. At several points in the story, more dramatic flashbacks take place: we see Charles Darwin first penning his theories of evolution and adaptation, a brief history of the grim activity of orchid-hunting, and, in one particularly impressive sequence, we are taken back billions of years to the beginning of life, to trace how Charlie Kaufman came to be here today.\n\nThough purportedly based on a true story, the events of the film are highly fictionalised, and the story always treads a fine line with reality, with the audience never certain of whether or not an event is real (in the context of the film) or merely a creation of Charlie's (or even Donald's) imagination. Charlie Kaufman (the true-life writer, not the character) often receives most of the accolades for the film, but it is director Spike Jonze who shared the vision to execute "Adaptation" on screen. His approach to film-making is always original and daring, never tentative of trying something unique for the sake of the film, even if it may offend the tastes of an audience that is unaccustomed to anything other than the mundane clichés of the modern movies that are churned out daily by Hollywood studios. If this wasn't completely obvious after the weird, twisted, fascinating 'Being John Malkovich,' then 'Adaptation' put any lingering doubts to rest. The director, who started his career directing music videos, seems to share a singular understanding with Kaufman the writer, and a mutual agreement on what the film is actually trying to say.\n\nIn addition to a clever story, 'Adaptation' contains some of the finest acting of the 2000s, presenting an excellent selection of seasoned talents at the top of their games. In arguably the greatest role(s) of his career, Nicolas Cage is phenomenal as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman, twin brothers whose complete polarity is startlingly evident in the execution of their respective film scripts. Charlie, whilst writing his adaptation, is determined to avoid the usual clichés and construct a film without any conventional plot, to write a movie "simply about flowers." Donald, however, blissfully oblivious to his own unoriginality as a writer, churns out a hackneyed psychological thriller, entitled 'The 3,' in which the serial killer, his female hostage and the cop are the very same person. In an ironic twist of fate, Donald's trite treatment is hailed as a masterpiece, adding further to the inadequacy already being felt by his disillusioned brother. Cage is excellent, and often absolutely hilarious, as both characters, giving each brother a distinct attitude and personality, so that it is possible to tell immediately which is which even though their physical appearance is exactly the same.\n\nMeryl Streep is equally excellent as Susan Orlean, the journalist for "The New Yorker" who researches John Laroche and endeavours to catch a glimpse of the famed and very rare Ghost Orchid, if only to understand what it feels like to be passionate about something. Chris Cooper arguably steals the entire show as the charismatic and enigmatic Laroche, whose tragedy-afflicted life is dedicated to mastering numerous obscure fields (such as orchid-collecting, or fish-collecting), each of which is sporadically cast aside and permanently forgotten as soon as he feels it's time to move on, to "adapt" to another hobby. From four Academy Award nominations, only Cooper walked away with a statue. Notably, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar. Since the script was credited to both "Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman," the latter became the only entirely fictional person in history to have been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nIn a nutshell, 'Adaptation' is all about failure. Charlie Kaufman is absolutely determined to write an original script, without cramming in "sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end." However, after he eventually asks Donald to complete the script for him, it descends into exactly that. A visit to a screen-writing seminar by Robert McKee (memorably played by Brian Cox)  who is famous for warning strongly against Deus Ex Machina  is used as exactly that. Charlie Kaufman the character fails miserably in writing his script, but, ironically, Charlie Kaufman the writer succeeds ever so magnificently!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No one's ever done a movie about flowers before."","reviewBody":"After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction novel, "The Orchid Thief," for the screen. However, it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable, its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel, Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation, but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze, who had also directed "Being John Malkovich," returned to direct "Adaptation," the quirky, twisting, self-referential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film, '8½,' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration, 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.\n\nNicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, the lonely, insecure and socially awkward screenwriter who is hired to adapt "The Orchid Thief," written by Susan Orlean, who is portrayed by Meryl Streep. The novel itself concerns the story of John Laroche (played by Chris Cooper), a smug plant dealer who was arrested in 1994 for poaching rare orchids in the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. As Kaufman struggles to write the script, his troubles are compounded by the presence of his twin brother, Donald (also played by Nicolas Cage), who is Charlie's exact opposite: reckless, carefree, over-confident and perhaps even a bit dim. The script for 'Adaptation' darts back and forth between different moments in time, either chronicling Kaufman's screen writing exploits or Orlean's experiences in writing her novel. At several points in the story, more dramatic flashbacks take place: we see Charles Darwin first penning his theories of evolution and adaptation, a brief history of the grim activity of orchid-hunting, and, in one particularly impressive sequence, we are taken back billions of years to the beginning of life, to trace how Charlie Kaufman came to be here today.\n\nThough purportedly based on a true story, the events of the film are highly fictionalised, and the story always treads a fine line with reality, with the audience never certain of whether or not an event is real (in the context of the film) or merely a creation of Charlie's (or even Donald's) imagination. Charlie Kaufman (the true-life writer, not the character) often receives most of the accolades for the film, but it is director Spike Jonze who shared the vision to execute "Adaptation" on screen. His approach to film-making is always original and daring, never tentative of trying something unique for the sake of the film, even if it may offend the tastes of an audience that is unaccustomed to anything other than the mundane clichés of the modern movies that are churned out daily by Hollywood studios. If this wasn't completely obvious after the weird, twisted, fascinating 'Being John Malkovich,' then 'Adaptation' put any lingering doubts to rest. The director, who started his career directing music videos, seems to share a singular understanding with Kaufman the writer, and a mutual agreement on what the film is actually trying to say.\n\nIn addition to a clever story, 'Adaptation' contains some of the finest acting of the 2000s, presenting an excellent selection of seasoned talents at the top of their games. In arguably the greatest role(s) of his career, Nicolas Cage is phenomenal as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman, twin brothers whose complete polarity is startlingly evident in the execution of their respective film scripts. Charlie, whilst writing his adaptation, is determined to avoid the usual clichés and construct a film without any conventional plot, to write a movie "simply about flowers." Donald, however, blissfully oblivious to his own unoriginality as a writer, churns out a hackneyed psychological thriller, entitled 'The 3,' in which the serial killer, his female hostage and the cop are the very same person. In an ironic twist of fate, Donald's trite treatment is hailed as a masterpiece, adding further to the inadequacy already being felt by his disillusioned brother. Cage is excellent, and often absolutely hilarious, as both characters, giving each brother a distinct attitude and personality, so that it is possible to tell immediately which is which even though their physical appearance is exactly the same.\n\nMeryl Streep is equally excellent as Susan Orlean, the journalist for "The New Yorker" who researches John Laroche and endeavours to catch a glimpse of the famed and very rare Ghost Orchid, if only to understand what it feels like to be passionate about something. Chris Cooper arguably steals the entire show as the charismatic and enigmatic Laroche, whose tragedy-afflicted life is dedicated to mastering numerous obscure fields (such as orchid-collecting, or fish-collecting), each of which is sporadically cast aside and permanently forgotten as soon as he feels it's time to move on, to "adapt" to another hobby. From four Academy Award nominations, only Cooper walked away with a statue. Notably, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar. Since the script was credited to both "Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman," the latter became the only entirely fictional person in history to have been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nIn a nutshell, 'Adaptation' is all about failure. Charlie Kaufman is absolutely determined to write an original script, without cramming in "sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end." However, after he eventually asks Donald to complete the script for him, it descends into exactly that. A visit to a screen-writing seminar by Robert McKee (memorably played by Brian Cox)  who is famous for warning strongly against Deus Ex Machina  is used as exactly that. Charlie Kaufman the character fails miserably in writing his script, but, ironically, Charlie Kaufman the writer succeeds ever so magnificently!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

No one's ever done a movie about flowers before."","reviewBody":"After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction novel, "The Orchid Thief," for the screen. However, it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable, its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel, Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation, but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze, who had also directed "Being John Malkovich," returned to direct "Adaptation," the quirky, twisting, self-referential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film, '8½,' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration, 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.\n\nNicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, the lonely, insecure and socially awkward screenwriter who is hired to adapt "The Orchid Thief," written by Susan Orlean, who is portrayed by Meryl Streep. The novel itself concerns the story of John Laroche (played by Chris Cooper), a smug plant dealer who was arrested in 1994 for poaching rare orchids in the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. As Kaufman struggles to write the script, his troubles are compounded by the presence of his twin brother, Donald (also played by Nicolas Cage), who is Charlie's exact opposite: reckless, carefree, over-confident and perhaps even a bit dim. The script for 'Adaptation' darts back and forth between different moments in time, either chronicling Kaufman's screen writing exploits or Orlean's experiences in writing her novel. At several points in the story, more dramatic flashbacks take place: we see Charles Darwin first penning his theories of evolution and adaptation, a brief history of the grim activity of orchid-hunting, and, in one particularly impressive sequence, we are taken back billions of years to the beginning of life, to trace how Charlie Kaufman came to be here today.\n\nThough purportedly based on a true story, the events of the film are highly fictionalised, and the story always treads a fine line with reality, with the audience never certain of whether or not an event is real (in the context of the film) or merely a creation of Charlie's (or even Donald's) imagination. Charlie Kaufman (the true-life writer, not the character) often receives most of the accolades for the film, but it is director Spike Jonze who shared the vision to execute "Adaptation" on screen. His approach to film-making is always original and daring, never tentative of trying something unique for the sake of the film, even if it may offend the tastes of an audience that is unaccustomed to anything other than the mundane clichés of the modern movies that are churned out daily by Hollywood studios. If this wasn't completely obvious after the weird, twisted, fascinating 'Being John Malkovich,' then 'Adaptation' put any lingering doubts to rest. The director, who started his career directing music videos, seems to share a singular understanding with Kaufman the writer, and a mutual agreement on what the film is actually trying to say.\n\nIn addition to a clever story, 'Adaptation' contains some of the finest acting of the 2000s, presenting an excellent selection of seasoned talents at the top of their games. In arguably the greatest role(s) of his career, Nicolas Cage is phenomenal as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman, twin brothers whose complete polarity is startlingly evident in the execution of their respective film scripts. Charlie, whilst writing his adaptation, is determined to avoid the usual clichés and construct a film without any conventional plot, to write a movie "simply about flowers." Donald, however, blissfully oblivious to his own unoriginality as a writer, churns out a hackneyed psychological thriller, entitled 'The 3,' in which the serial killer, his female hostage and the cop are the very same person. In an ironic twist of fate, Donald's trite treatment is hailed as a masterpiece, adding further to the inadequacy already being felt by his disillusioned brother. Cage is excellent, and often absolutely hilarious, as both characters, giving each brother a distinct attitude and personality, so that it is possible to tell immediately which is which even though their physical appearance is exactly the same.\n\nMeryl Streep is equally excellent as Susan Orlean, the journalist for "The New Yorker" who researches John Laroche and endeavours to catch a glimpse of the famed and very rare Ghost Orchid, if only to understand what it feels like to be passionate about something. Chris Cooper arguably steals the entire show as the charismatic and enigmatic Laroche, whose tragedy-afflicted life is dedicated to mastering numerous obscure fields (such as orchid-collecting, or fish-collecting), each of which is sporadically cast aside and permanently forgotten as soon as he feels it's time to move on, to "adapt" to another hobby. From four Academy Award nominations, only Cooper walked away with a statue. Notably, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar. Since the script was credited to both "Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman," the latter became the only entirely fictional person in history to have been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nIn a nutshell, 'Adaptation' is all about failure. Charlie Kaufman is absolutely determined to write an original script, without cramming in "sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end." However, after he eventually asks Donald to complete the script for him, it descends into exactly that. A visit to a screen-writing seminar by Robert McKee (memorably played by Brian Cox)  who is famous for warning strongly against Deus Ex Machina  is used as exactly that. Charlie Kaufman the character fails miserably in writing his script, but, ironically, Charlie Kaufman the writer succeeds ever so magnificently!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

She has a fine counterpart in the handsome and Dennis Quaid who has not had such a plumb role since his early days. \n\nThough every film should stand on its own, you should check out the milieu that Todd Haynes is working in  the oeuvre of Douglas Sirk being the main source  but you can also check out earlier films like DARK VICTORY and other domestic dramas.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44522,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

that hardly fit in your mind!","reviewBody":"This film has one of the most offbeat ideas I've ever come across.They are so unique in a way that they make Donnie Darko look cheap.But it has the same problems like any other film with outstanding ideas.It lacks a definite focus.\n\nI got a chance to get a look at the film at the Cannes festival where it was premiering to a bunch of critics who pretty much didn't like it.And there's no surprise to that.Although,you have to admire Kelly's attempt on something way out of anyones imagination.The film is given a very different approach and it will go down in history as the most offbeat/outstanding failures.He has it all,a mind blowing story,that we hardly get, watching the film the first time, great characters,excellent writing,sets,music,cinematography and perhaps a decent directing.\n\nKelly surpasses any one's expectation when you go into details about this film.But he leaves a chilling disappointment when you actually watch the entire film ,which is longer than it needs to be.He misses his audience from the very beginning.It seems like he is lost in a cloud of ideas and never gave a hard thought on how to put them on screen,and most importantly ,how will people interpret those issues he is trying to depict.\n\nThe story,I don't know how to put it,is kind of out of my reach.It requires repeated viewing to fully understand the plot,but if you do get it, it could turn out to be a cult classic.The sad thing is that I didn't quite get it.Okay,here goes....The film is set in the year 2008,about the downfall of the American society,the economy,and major environmental disaster which is taking place.The whole world is at the brink of destruction,war ,poverty and all those issues are getting more and more serious,and in between these events, a number of Characters are having problems of their own.A Boxer is an action star who seems to be amnesiac and somehow he meets this porn star Krysta ,who is starting her own reality show.David Clark ,who is a police officer with a secret to a conspiracy within the government.And all their stories intervene and chaos begins and confusion reigns.\n\nTrust me ,I didn't get what was going on the first 30 minutes,then it kind of made sense and I knew what Kelly's intentions were.He was trying his ass out to bring us something new but loses everything and never achieves what he could achieve.\n\nI would say this film had massive expectations from audiences ,me personally.Donnie Darko was a film unlike anything I've seen before and it was unique in a number of ways.Here he tried but fails miserably,and in total embarrassment.Kelly somehow may have been affected by the failure of Domino ,which he wrote.But I have to say, you guys should check this film out.For his first film's sake.I mean there is a lot to watch here,the sets are highly creative and a splendid Cinematography in aid.There are some wonderful comic moments and a number of interesting dramatic and exciting moments,even when ideas were floating all over the film.The films main problem is that it doesn't decide what to do.How to present it's story,it's full of confusion and hardly will there be a positive reaction to Kelly's execution.I really found the film somewhat frustrating at time and also somewhat astonishing.It had its moments but it never tries to be the next big thing.For one thing,the characters were underdeveloped,and I had no idea what Kelly was trying to prove.There are hardly any explanations,but I believe if you watch it several times,there is a great chance that you might actually get it.And then you can call it classic.\n\nPerformances are okay.The Rock underplays his part,Gellar is fine as a porn star turned reality TV host.And as usual Sean Willaim Scott ain't funny.And the rest of the cast is quite comme si comme sa!\n\nOverall,a film that should join "I heart Huckabees",or "Life Aquatic" as being different and unique on the surface but from the inside it's all shallow and bland.And yes utterly confusing.An interesting disappointment ,I guess.\n\nOR,\n\nMaybe because it was only half complete and everything was jumbled,and mismashed.That's why I didn't get it.Or maybe something else.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"duration":"PT2H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

that hardly fit in your mind!","reviewBody":"This film has one of the most offbeat ideas I've ever come across.They are so unique in a way that they make Donnie Darko look cheap.But it has the same problems like any other film with outstanding ideas.It lacks a definite focus.\n\nI got a chance to get a look at the film at the Cannes festival where it was premiering to a bunch of critics who pretty much didn't like it.And there's no surprise to that.Although,you have to admire Kelly's attempt on something way out of anyones imagination.The film is given a very different approach and it will go down in history as the most offbeat/outstanding failures.He has it all,a mind blowing story,that we hardly get, watching the film the first time, great characters,excellent writing,sets,music,cinematography and perhaps a decent directing.\n\nKelly surpasses any one's expectation when you go into details about this film.But he leaves a chilling disappointment when you actually watch the entire film ,which is longer than it needs to be.He misses his audience from the very beginning.It seems like he is lost in a cloud of ideas and never gave a hard thought on how to put them on screen,and most importantly ,how will people interpret those issues he is trying to depict.\n\nThe story,I don't know how to put it,is kind of out of my reach.It requires repeated viewing to fully understand the plot,but if you do get it, it could turn out to be a cult classic.The sad thing is that I didn't quite get it.Okay,here goes....The film is set in the year 2008,about the downfall of the American society,the economy,and major environmental disaster which is taking place.The whole world is at the brink of destruction,war ,poverty and all those issues are getting more and more serious,and in between these events, a number of Characters are having problems of their own.A Boxer is an action star who seems to be amnesiac and somehow he meets this porn star Krysta ,who is starting her own reality show.David Clark ,who is a police officer with a secret to a conspiracy within the government.And all their stories intervene and chaos begins and confusion reigns.\n\nTrust me ,I didn't get what was going on the first 30 minutes,then it kind of made sense and I knew what Kelly's intentions were.He was trying his ass out to bring us something new but loses everything and never achieves what he could achieve.\n\nI would say this film had massive expectations from audiences ,me personally.Donnie Darko was a film unlike anything I've seen before and it was unique in a number of ways.Here he tried but fails miserably,and in total embarrassment.Kelly somehow may have been affected by the failure of Domino ,which he wrote.But I have to say, you guys should check this film out.For his first film's sake.I mean there is a lot to watch here,the sets are highly creative and a splendid Cinematography in aid.There are some wonderful comic moments and a number of interesting dramatic and exciting moments,even when ideas were floating all over the film.The films main problem is that it doesn't decide what to do.How to present it's story,it's full of confusion and hardly will there be a positive reaction to Kelly's execution.I really found the film somewhat frustrating at time and also somewhat astonishing.It had its moments but it never tries to be the next big thing.For one thing,the characters were underdeveloped,and I had no idea what Kelly was trying to prove.There are hardly any explanations,but I believe if you watch it several times,there is a great chance that you might actually get it.And then you can call it classic.\n\nPerformances are okay.The Rock underplays his part,Gellar is fine as a porn star turned reality TV host.And as usual Sean Willaim Scott ain't funny.And the rest of the cast is quite comme si comme sa!\n\nOverall,a film that should join "I heart Huckabees",or "Life Aquatic" as being different and unique on the surface but from the inside it's all shallow and bland.And yes utterly confusing.An interesting disappointment ,I guess.\n\nOR,\n\nMaybe because it was only half complete and everything was jumbled,and mismashed.That's why I didn't get it.Or maybe something else.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT2H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Benoit Delholmme deservedly won several international awards for his camera-work in here.\n\nThe story is uniquely presented, different enough that it kept me very involved wondering what was coming next. For those expecting a brainless revenge story or shoot 'em up western, they will be disappointed. There is a lot of thought to this film, and it varies scene- to-scene from classy to crude.\n\nGuy Pearce, Ray Winstone and Emily Watson are three actors I am familiar with, and I enjoyed all three of their performances. This is not a well-known movie here in the States, but if you like tough westerns and something a bit different, check it out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50811,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's fairly long at 130 minutes but Steve McQueen is usually charismatic enough to carry a film, and he does so here, too.\n\nAs the title character, "Nevada Smith," McQueen is joined by a number of well- known actors of the 1960s: Suzanne Pleshette, Karl Malden, Brian Keith, Arthur Kennedy, Raf Vallone, Martin Landau Janet Margolin and Pat Hingle.\n\nMcQueen plays a man who is totally dominated by thoughts of revenge. It motivates his every move. I don't recommend that attitude, but it makes for a good movie.\n\nIt was nice to see this in 2:35:1 widescreen. Even though I owned a new tape, that nice western photography made the DVD purchase worthwhile.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7697,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Russell stars as a smart but inexperienced intelligence analyst who's given the task of a lifetime when he, along with a group of rugged Special Forces commandos, must board an American 747 in midair after it's hijacked by ruthless international terrorists. It's a race against time as they must not only ensure the safety of all the passengers, but retake the plane before it can reach the U.S. eastern seaboard. Swift direction, exciting, skillful action sequences, endless suspense, and rock solid performances make this wild ride of a movie a definite must for action fans. ***","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51904,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Although there is not too much of a storyline, the slick action scenes combined with some very good performances from Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne kept me entertained from start to finish.\n\nWhile Passenger 57 offers nothing really new to the action genre, it does offer plenty of fast paced chaos and explosions and combined with some entertaining hand-to-hand combat skills by Snipes, it is certainly better than a lot of other standard action fares out there.\n\nSnipes gives a very good performance as the lead and Bruce Payne is brilliant as the mentally unstable villain. The other cast are somewhat overshadowed by Snipes and Payne, but do an adequate enough job.\n\nOverall I was very pleased by Passenger 57, so much so that it proudly belongs in my DVD collection. A very good choice for action fans and a must for Snipes fans. 8/10.\n\nAnd don't forget...."Always bet on black!"","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45809,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Although there is not too much of a storyline, the slick action scenes combined with some very good performances from Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne kept me entertained from start to finish.\n\nWhile Passenger 57 offers nothing really new to the action genre, it does offer plenty of fast paced chaos and explosions and combined with some entertaining hand-to-hand combat skills by Snipes, it is certainly better than a lot of other standard action fares out there.\n\nSnipes gives a very good performance as the lead and Bruce Payne is brilliant as the mentally unstable villain. The other cast are somewhat overshadowed by Snipes and Payne, but do an adequate enough job.\n\nOverall I was very pleased by Passenger 57, so much so that it proudly belongs in my DVD collection. A very good choice for action fans and a must for Snipes fans. 8/10.\n\nAnd don't forget...."Always bet on black!"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45809,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.\n\nDirector Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue, and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or less.\n\nAnd The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It's one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really matter?\n\nAs Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers, and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert's former CIA contact, who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches "blink-and-you-miss him" cameo status, by casting a reputable star like Bill Pullman as Leo's husband, and giving him no more than four lines (though of course it's possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room).\n\nIf anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall's troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really? The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but isn't really interested in following through. For all its thin characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance.\n\n\n* See more at: www.mediumraretv.org\n","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":341860,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And as an added bonus, it can be watched even if you are over ten. As the far too little-known short Bedhead, Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children, featuring children... which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess. Adults often forget what children are like, and think of them as 'less' than the grownups. Rodriguez gives them(and us) a film that allows them a similar status to adults. The film has stuff that will appeal to kids(spy equipment hidden in children's things) but it isn't offensive to us who aren't. While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion, it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion. The plot is pretty good, though I guess it's not all that original... and as usual with children's films, the kids are the heroes, which puts too much pressure on them, as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it. The acting is a usual high(as most of the actors are quite talented), no performances really let you down, even the (intentionally)overplayed ones. The characters, many of them fairly clichéd and thin, are all credible. As with many(most) Rodriguez films, pretty much all of those that he's written, himself... there are subplots and such, many of which are either overly easily resolved or not properly addressed. The humor is pretty good, I laughed out loud several points, rather unusual for children's films, and I was never insulted by the humor. None of it tries too hard to garner laughs, either. The special effects are quite impressive, and though it's still evident that it's Rodriguez' mini studio, it will fool you for the very most part. The action is quite intense and exciting, and like the humor, it's got Rodriguez' unique touch. Any fan of Rodriguez(such as myself, which is by far the main reason I watched this very film in the first place) will enjoy this, if maybe not to the same extent as one of his typical films. I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez or any of the actors, and definitely most kids. Very much worth watching, even if you've outgrown childhood. Indulge your inner kid. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110409,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And as an added bonus, it can be watched even if you are over ten. As the far too little-known short Bedhead, Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children, featuring children... which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess. Adults often forget what children are like, and think of them as 'less' than the grownups. Rodriguez gives them(and us) a film that allows them a similar status to adults. The film has stuff that will appeal to kids(spy equipment hidden in children's things) but it isn't offensive to us who aren't. While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion, it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion. The plot is pretty good, though I guess it's not all that original... and as usual with children's films, the kids are the heroes, which puts too much pressure on them, as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it.

The vehicle driven by Erin, an unemployed, twice-divorced mother of three, is broadsided by a speeding car at an intersection. She takes her case to a rumpled, cowed lawyer Ed Masry, who agrees to represent her on a contingency basis. However, in court, Erin's surly manner and blasphemous vocabulary do not endear her to the jury, which finds itself in the defendant's favor, as Erin goes home empty-handed. Still without work and needing to pay her bills, Erin, who has no demonstrable skills, but a passion, an uncommon quantity of common sense, and a defiant way of talking, finagles her way into a position as a file clerk under her former attorney.\n\nIt is in this capacity that she uncovers, entirely by accident, a paper trail leading to the town of Hinkley, CA, where an endless stream of residents have been diagnosed with various medical conditions including cancer, disintegrating spinal cords and brain damage. It turns out that the community of Hinkley has been poisoned by hexavalent chromium, leaching into the drinking water from the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) plant. The case is especially odious because PG&amp;E knew exactly what it was doing but lied about what kind of chromium it was using. Erin gains the trust of the community to mount legal action and strong-arms Ed to put together a case that would win the largest direct claim settlement in American history, even as her personal life is threatened by her devotion to the case.\n\nSteven Soderbergh tests Erin's limits of likability numerous times throughout the movie. An early scene is designed to show what a short fuse Erin has when she explodes in a torrent of profanity in the courtroom. Erin, the film makes clear early on, is no sentimental crusader. Rather, she is a tough, hard-nosed cookie who dresses like a hoochie and who would use anything from here heavily coiffured hair to her cleavage or also her baby to get what she needs. In short, Erin is adrift in a hard world. But what makes this potentially despicable character so affable is Julia Roberts' vulnerable and fiercely dynamic performance. As the eponymous character, she is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. As a foil for Erin, Albert Finney draws out a complex, engaging performance that is as warm as it is funny. Their scenes together crackle with chemistry and it's a joy to see this kind of male/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction. \n\nSoderbergh infuses the proceedings with a vibrant, almost peppy sense of style that would not have been half as compelling had a less edgy director helmed it. It would have been easy for him to have allowed Erin Brockovich to descend into manipulative melodrama, but he resists that path of least resistance, instead giving us a film that is smart, savvy, funny, and, at times, poignant.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179727,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That was a very good movie with a star-studded cast. I'm guessing that "Battle of the Bulge" was an attempt to unofficially follow up on that movie. It's not as star-studded (although there's a bit of cross over in the cast, most notably Henry Fonda.) Truthfully, though, this movie is nowhere near as good as "The Longest Day."\n\nIt's supposed to be an account of The Battle of The Bulge, which took place in December of 1944. It was the last significant German offensive of the war, intended to break through the Allied lines and re- capture the port city of Antwerp, Belgium - thus throwing Allied supply lines into chaos. The movie gets some things right. The Germans did, indeed, get troops disguised as American MPs behind the American lines, and they were able to cause confusion and chaos. The Germans were also woefully short of fuel, and had targeted an American supply depot which would have given them access to a huge amount of gasoline for their tanks. The famous demand for the surrender of Bastogne, and the reply of the commanding American general to that demand - "NUTS!" - is accurate. But there are also a lot of problems with the historical accuracy of the film. First is that all of the characters are just that - characters. Composites, perhaps, but there's no portrayal of anyone who actually fought in the battle. There's also no mention at all of General George Patton's 3rd Army dramatically saving the besieged Americans at Bastogne. That's one of the better known incidents of the Battle of the Bulge, and why you wouldn't even mention it is beyond me. Many, of course, note the problem that the tanks used in the movie were of a much later vintage, and were't an accurate representation of the tanks that would have been used.\n\nAt best, I'd say that this movie was OK. Terrible if you're thinking that you're learning much history from it, but OK as a movie that's somewhat dramatic, and I thought it was a reasonable portrayal of the ugliness of war - the Malmedy massacre (the cold blooded murders of Americans who had been taken prisoner by German SS troops) was portrayed, for example. \n\nI'd definitely say that if I were going to watch either again, I'd take in "The Longest Day." It's the better movie. This one gets a 5/10 from me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That's one of the better known incidents of the Battle of the Bulge, and why you wouldn't even mention it is beyond me. Many, of course, note the problem that the tanks used in the movie were of a much later vintage, and were't an accurate representation of the tanks that would have been used.\n\nAt best, I'd say that this movie was OK. Terrible if you're thinking that you're learning much history from it, but OK as a movie that's somewhat dramatic, and I thought it was a reasonable portrayal of the ugliness of war - the Malmedy massacre (the cold blooded murders of Americans who had been taken prisoner by German SS troops) was portrayed, for example. \n\nI'd definitely say that if I were going to watch either again, I'd take in "The Longest Day." It's the better movie. This one gets a 5/10 from me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT2H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel "The Hellbound Heart". The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...\n\nThe main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're "too gory" or "stupid" - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.\n\nA writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating.

The originality on display throughout Hellraiser is astounding, as is the atmosphere and the performances pulled out of the actors, along with the fact that this film has entertained me many times and is still as good today as the first time I saw it.

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel "The Hellbound Heart". The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...\n\nThe main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're "too gory" or "stupid" - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.\n\nA writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film - but Hellraiser has none of it! The entire cast shine, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.\n\nOverall, I have pointed out a couple of flaws here; but I really can't bring myself to give this masterpiece any less than full marks.

The FX are acceptable (the last Avengers was not much better and cost 50 times more); but the characters are pure stock. Forced; unsympathetic and underwritten. Action scenes are not spectacular as they were supposed to be; and villain motivations (or goals) are not that clear.\n\nIn brief; perhaps next time with better production and writing they will make a better movie; but just one is just a curiosity.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11995,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I've seen the first 2 episodes of 8. Petersens "original" das Boot of 1981 surely was an impressive movie/serie. Here, the only thing in common with the new serie (described as a sequel) seems to be the name, I wonder how they were able to get the rights to use it with its soundtrack. In fact, here we get a highly thrilling and complicated espionage/action, the similarities to the original are reduced to the settings of the sea, subs, uniforms. In that regard it is well produced, adequate settings, well shot, convincing gear etc. So if you are willed to overlook all these footnotes you will get a decent entertainment, although highly political correct. In the latter regard the german filmmaking is really hopeless. I guess Petersen just shakes his head.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6566,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've seen the first 2 episodes of 8. Petersens "original" das Boot of 1981 surely was an impressive movie/serie. Here, the only thing in common with the new serie (described as a sequel) seems to be the name, I wonder how they were able to get the rights to use it with its soundtrack. In fact, here we get a highly thrilling and complicated espionage/action, the similarities to the original are reduced to the settings of the sea, subs, uniforms. In that regard it is well produced, adequate settings, well shot, convincing gear etc. So if you are willed to overlook all these footnotes you will get a decent entertainment, although highly political correct. In the latter regard the german filmmaking is really hopeless. I guess Petersen just shakes his head.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6566,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Often Irritating","reviewBody":"I'd heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me \n\nRidley Scott has been swotting up on the films and technique of David Lean and in many ways Scott is a natural successor to that legendary film director . The battle scenes are even better than the ones seen in Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING and at no time did I believe I was watching an unconvincing CGI battle fest , just an army of thousands of extras walloping each other over the head like you'd see in the greatest Hollywood epics of yesteryear . Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he's the sort of " movie star " who's only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film . The only thing that the director Can be criticised for is an over reliance of slow motion during the battle scenes but apart from that everything else on screen is Oscar worthy , though since Scott was under rewarded at award ceremonies you get the feeling that he was trying a little too hard to win an Oscar \n\nThere's an old saying that " if a film is good then it's down to the director and if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter " and this is certainly true of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN . Throughout the running time I was left scratching my head wondering about characters motives and why certain characters did certain things and let's not ignore the clichés of " You are a brave warrior so I will let you live " type moments . Some people claim that the studio should be held responsible rather than screenwriter William Monahan since they made several cuts to the final print and there's a disjointed feel to the narrative . Perhaps this is true but I wonder how many people watching this on DVD or on television like me had to keep logging in to the wikipedia in order to understand what was happening on screen . It should also be pointed out that there's a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil . One wonders if the knight templars were still in existence today if they'd be shown in this way . In many ways it's like watching a second world war film where Germans are shown as being as much as victims of Nazism as those in the occupied territories . Honestly I was expecting the templars to goose step in to battle while proclaiming " I vos only obeying orders " . It says something about the quality of director and cast when they can rise above such one dimensional scripting \n\nIn short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it . Historians probably won't like it and you get the feeling no one will love KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and everyone will give slightly different reasons as to why they didn't love it . In short it's a very flawed masterpiece","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271337,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me \n\nRidley Scott has been swotting up on the films and technique of David Lean and in many ways Scott is a natural successor to that legendary film director . The battle scenes are even better than the ones seen in Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING and at no time did I believe I was watching an unconvincing CGI battle fest , just an army of thousands of extras walloping each other over the head like you'd see in the greatest Hollywood epics of yesteryear . Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he's the sort of " movie star " who's only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film . The only thing that the director Can be criticised for is an over reliance of slow motion during the battle scenes but apart from that everything else on screen is Oscar worthy , though since Scott was under rewarded at award ceremonies you get the feeling that he was trying a little too hard to win an Oscar \n\nThere's an old saying that " if a film is good then it's down to the director and if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter " and this is certainly true of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN . Throughout the running time I was left scratching my head wondering about characters motives and why certain characters did certain things and let's not ignore the clichés of " You are a brave warrior so I will let you live " type moments . Some people claim that the studio should be held responsible rather than screenwriter William Monahan since they made several cuts to the final print and there's a disjointed feel to the narrative . Perhaps this is true but I wonder how many people watching this on DVD or on television like me had to keep logging in to the wikipedia in order to understand what was happening on screen . It should also be pointed out that there's a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil . One wonders if the knight templars were still in existence today if they'd be shown in this way . In many ways it's like watching a second world war film where Germans are shown as being as much as victims of Nazism as those in the occupied territories . Honestly I was expecting the templars to goose step in to battle while proclaiming " I vos only obeying orders " . It says something about the quality of director and cast when they can rise above such one dimensional scripting \n\nIn short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it . Historians probably won't like it and you get the feeling no one will love KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and everyone will give slightly different reasons as to why they didn't love it . In short it's a very flawed masterpiece","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271337,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The best animated film of the year!","reviewBody":"Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the "Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called "Sugar Rush". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.\n\nI had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever – a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.\n\nSo, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).\n\nJohn C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the "Sugar Rush" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a "glitch" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the "Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as "Hero's Duty", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.\n\nI didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.\n\nThe animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.\n\nThe characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.\n\nGenerally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":387756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Sluškinjina priča</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Serija prati ženu prisiljenu živjeti kao konkubina pod fundamentalističkom teokratskom diktaturom u bliskoj budućnosti u totalitarnom Gileadu, gdje ženska prava u osnovi ne postoje. Adaptacija klasičnog romana Margaret Atwood, "Sluškinjina priča" govori o životu u distopiji Gileada, totalitarnog društva u nekadašnjim Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama. Suočeni s ekološkom katastrofom i oštrim padom nataliteta, Gileadom vlada izopačeni fundamentalizam u svom militariziranom "povratku tradicionalnim vrijednostima". Kao jedna od rijetkih preostalih plodnih žena, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) je Sluškinja u Zapovjednikovu kućanstvu, jedna iz kaste žena prisiljenih na seksualno ropstvo u posljednjem očajničkom pokušaju da se svijet ponovno napuči. Emmyjem nagrađena dramska serija vraća se s drugom sezonom koja se vrti oko Offredine trudnoće i njezine trajne borbe da oslobodi svoje buduće dijete iz distopijskih užasa Gileada. "Gilead je u tebi", omiljena je uzrečica tete Lydije. U drugoj sezoni Offred i svi naši likovi borit će se protiv ove mračne istine - ili joj podleći.</desc>

After all its from producer Sam Raimi 'Evil Dead , Don't Breath' just like the movie poster said . Well I will put it this way after watching this horror film I really had an 'Unstoppable urge' to go all Walking Tall ,Joe- Don- Baker ....Buford Pusser with my Old Hickory Stick; and commence smashing ever Living Daylights out of the Blu-ray &amp; case and by doing so establish some sense of satisfaction to the fact of spending $28.00 and pre-ordering this film.\n\nDirected by Nicolas Pesce . Screenplay by Nicolas Pesce. Written by Nicolas Pesce. I would really like to summon the ghost of Shakma at this point and introduce Skakma to the fine fatheaded Mr. Nicolas Pesce in formatt of locking the both is a small closet together. My money is on Shakma .\n\nI all seriousness The acting of the cast is actually quite strong during certain moments.Andrea Riseborough as Detective Muldoon was excellent .

Well I will put it this way after watching this horror film I really had an 'Unstoppable urge' to go all Walking Tall ,Joe- Don- Baker ....Buford Pusser with my Old Hickory Stick; and commence smashing ever Living Daylights out of the Blu-ray &amp; case and by doing so establish some sense of satisfaction to the fact of spending $28.00 and pre-ordering this film.\n\nDirected by Nicolas Pesce . Screenplay by Nicolas Pesce. Written by Nicolas Pesce. I would really like to summon the ghost of Shakma at this point and introduce Skakma to the fine fatheaded Mr. Nicolas Pesce in formatt of locking the both is a small closet together.

A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs.

Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life. Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability -- and his sanity.

A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.\n\nAndrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.\n\nI had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, "run the table now," he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.\n\nI lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.\n\nMy expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.\n\nRecommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.\n\nRe-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.\n\nMemorable: I am still thinking about this film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":741190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life. Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability -- and his sanity. ","datePublished":"2014-10-15","description":"A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.","keywords":"drummer,music school,new york city,conservatory,drum solo","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2582802/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Gbert254","dateCreated":"2014-01-28","inLanguage":"English","name":"An incredibly powerful film!","reviewBody":"http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/\n\nEver had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.\n\nAndrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.\n\nI had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, "run the table now," he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.\n\nI lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.\n\nMy expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.\n\nRecommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.\n\nRe-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.\n\nMemorable: I am still thinking about this film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":741190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Cole porter's heyday was long before I was around, but I was instantly attracted to his music in my youth, and that love for his compositions has never ceased.\n\nI know many here are bad mouthing the movie "De-Lovely", and they shouldn't be. There are so many unwatchable, ridiculously bad movies being released nowadays, that De-lovely looks like Gone with the Wind compared to many of them. We have several generations of young people that do not have the benefit of the diverse media many of us older people had when we were young. Back when radio and television use to thrived on diversity. They are now totally market driven toward youth, and offer little diversity. The re-birth of the musical these past few years, is introducing youth to a quality of art that most were not even aware existed. The influence movies like De-Lovely could have on young artist should not be under-estimated. I remember many musicals in my youth that greatly influenced my future career as a musician.\n\nI found De-Lovely to be a delightful movie. I found both Kline and Judd to be excellent in their roles. While the story has taken some lead way with the facts, they got the majority of important points across, and with a lot of style in my opinion. The makers of this movie had to do a balancing act between biography and entertainment. Between telling the story of Porter's life, and paying tribute to his incredible talent as a song writer. I left the movie theater feeling upbeat and inspired. That told me they balanced the two very well.\n\nWhile I might of chosen a few different singers to sing Porter's songs in the movie, I realize that using known, modern singers helps get youth into the theater, and that's important. The artist they choose to sing Porter's music in the movie, did a wonderful job. While some renditions are a little too modernized, any influence his music has on today's youth is a good thing. Our young people need to know that real works of art take skill, training, talent, and time. Much of todays music is aimed toward an audience with a very short attention span, wanting instant gratification, and to counter that with the music of Cole Porter is a wonderful gift to an entire generation.\n\nThis movie works on so many levels. The music, the period, the love affair, and the pain. The story is about Porter looking back at his life during his last moments on earth, he sees it as a theatrical production. Because of this, the songs are not all in chronological order. A few of the songs were placed out of sequence to fit the story line. This idea works splendidly, and it is beyond me why some reviewers seemed to miss this concept completely, and thought the writers messed up. The truth is we really don't know that much about Cole porter. He was not fond of the press, and the relationship between his wife Linda and him was very private. We do know Cole was gay, but loved Linda deeply his entire life. The movie raises more questions than it answers, as it should. Cole was a complicated person, and lived a complicated life. This is movie making at it's best, folks. I recommend this movie highly. I hope Hollywood keeps the musicals coming. It's about time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10964,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nova priča zatječe Dianu Prince kako neprimjetno živi među smrtnicima u živahnim, elegantnim 1980-ima - eri hedonizma i želje za posjedovanjem. Iako je u potpunosti razvila svoje moći, ona ostaje pritajena, bavi se prikupljanjem drevnih artefakta, a herojska djela izvodi samo potajno. Međutim, Diana će uskoro morati skupiti svu svoju snagu, mudrost i hrabrost kad se sukobi s Maxwellom Lordom i Cheetom, zlikovkom koja posjeduje nadljudsku snagu i spretnost.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Komedija smještena u urede korporacije Raj, Inc. Nakon što Bog odluči uništiti Zemlju, dvojica niskorangiranih anđela moraju ga uvjeriti da spasi ljudski rod. Prva sezona antologijske humoristične serije "Čudotvorci", snimljene prema knjizi "What in God's Name" Simona Richa, komedija je na radnome mjestu koja se odvija u Raju. U seriji glume Daniel Radcliffe, Steve Buscemi, Geraldine Viswanathan i Karan Soni. Radcliffe glumi Craiga, niskorangirana anđela odgovorna za ljudske molitve, a Steve Buscemi glumi Craigova šefa, Boga, koji je dignuo ruke od ljudskog roda te je spreman krenuti na idući projekt. Da bi spriječili uništenje Zemlje, Craig i anđelica Eliza (Geraldine Viswanathan) moraju uslišati naoko nemoguću molitvu: pomoći dvama ljudskim bićima, Lauri i Samu, da se zaljube jedno u drugo.</desc>

Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did.

It occurred one too many times, and I found that it took me out of the movie for just a bit.\n\nWhile good, the scenes leading up to the ending are a bit predictable, and the 'showdown' (remember, good vs. evil) leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, however, I can live with it, seeing as Rebecca Ferguson saves it by just being in it, and King and the creators do their best to come full circle.

In the meantime we meet Betty's hunky handsome protective Grandson Stephen perfectly played by Russell Tovey who seeks out to find out all he can about his Grandmother's new border and boyfriend.\n\nJim Carter who plays Mr Carson in Downton Abbey is very impressive in the very different role of Vincent the best friend of Roy Courtney and "business associate " it's a great ensemble cast and this film has some great plot twisters and surprises that at times may seem a little improbable but that didn't bother me a bit.\n\nIt's the performances of McKellen and Mirren that are sublime, subtle and mesmerising the range of these two actors is astonishing when you think back to characters like Helen Mirren in The Queen or Catherine the Great and Maria Altman in Woman in Gold then Ian McKellen as Gandalf or James Whale in Gods and Monsters and King Lear to see them together in a film for the first time ,they have appeared on stage together in 2001 in Dance of Death on Broadway.\n\nI must mention the great score by Carter Burwell it's perfect and gives great atmosphere to the emotional and suspenseful plot I really like his scores and this is up with his previous film scores for Carol, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing ,Missouri and In Bruges.\n\nI really enjoyed The Good Liar go see it and don't let anyone tell you the outcome of this complex story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29215,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the meantime we meet Betty's hunky handsome protective Grandson Stephen perfectly played by Russell Tovey who seeks out to find out all he can about his Grandmother's new border and boyfriend.\n\nJim Carter who plays Mr Carson in Downton Abbey is very impressive in the very different role of Vincent the best friend of Roy Courtney and "business associate " it's a great ensemble cast and this film has some great plot twisters and surprises that at times may seem a little improbable but that didn't bother me a bit.\n\nIt's the performances of McKellen and Mirren that are sublime, subtle and mesmerising the range of these two actors is astonishing when you think back to characters like Helen Mirren in The Queen or Catherine the Great and Maria Altman in Woman in Gold then Ian McKellen as Gandalf or James Whale in Gods and Monsters and King Lear to see them together in a film for the first time ,they have appeared on stage together in 2001 in Dance of Death on Broadway.\n\nI must mention the great score by Carter Burwell it's perfect and gives great atmosphere to the emotional and suspenseful plot I really like his scores and this is up with his previous film scores for Carol, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing ,Missouri and In Bruges.\n\nI really enjoyed The Good Liar go see it and don't let anyone tell you the outcome of this complex story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29215,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself.

Considering how difficult it is to get creative with sports movies, through its narrative, this film manages to put its own touch which will make basketball fans enjoy the grit, realism and attitude towards the game.

In high school, he was a basketball phenom with a full university scholarship, when suddenly, for reasons unknown, he walked away from the game, forfeiting his future. Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself. As the boys start to come together as a team and win, Jack may have finally found a reason to confront the demons that have derailed him. But will it be enough to fill the void, heal the deep wounds of his past, and set him on the road to redemption?","datePublished":"2020-03-06","description":"Jack Cunningham was a high school basketball phenom who walked away from the game, forfeiting his future.

Upon watching, I discovered that The Way Back is not a purely basketball film but a story of a man stumbling through life and using the sport as a branch to prevent him from hitting the ground.\n\nBen Affleck puts a on compelling performance of a man battling his demons and despite basketball managing to bring some happiness into his life, he can never trully heal his scars. Considering how difficult it is to get creative with sports movies, through its narrative, this film manages to put its own touch which will make basketball fans enjoy the grit, realism and attitude towards the game. Music deserves a separate mention as it adds impact to the dramatic nature of the film.\n\n#moviesshmovies","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Serija prati ženu prisiljenu živjeti kao konkubina pod fundamentalističkom teokratskom diktaturom u bliskoj budućnosti u totalitarnom Gileadu, gdje ženska prava u osnovi ne postoje. Adaptacija klasičnog romana Margaret Atwood, "Sluškinjina priča" govori o životu u distopiji Gileada, totalitarnog društva u nekadašnjim Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama. Suočeni s ekološkom katastrofom i oštrim padom nataliteta, Gileadom vlada izopačeni fundamentalizam u svom militariziranom "povratku tradicionalnim vrijednostima". Kao jedna od rijetkih preostalih plodnih žena, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) je Sluškinja u Zapovjednikovu kućanstvu, jedna iz kaste žena prisiljenih na seksualno ropstvo u posljednjem očajničkom pokušaju da se svijet ponovno napuči. Emmyjem nagrađena dramska serija vraća se s drugom sezonom koja se vrti oko Offredine trudnoće i njezine trajne borbe da oslobodi svoje buduće dijete iz distopijskih užasa Gileada. "Gilead je u tebi", omiljena je uzrečica tete Lydije. U drugoj sezoni Offred i svi naši likovi borit će se protiv ove mračne istine - ili joj podleći.</desc>

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.

Basically, "Little Italy" is a millennial's Romeo &amp; Juliet, but in 2018 film looks, feels and plays like a VHS movie from two decades earlier. The real problem is that "Little Italy" is just to bland, with nothing we don't expect happening and the whole show moving steadily to an ending that is threadbare to the point of see through.

The real problem is that "Little Italy" is just to bland, with nothing we don't expect happening and the whole show moving steadily to an ending that is threadbare to the point of see through.

Stale, rushed and lacking any insightful emotional depth, Radioactive is a dull watch throughout, failing in its attempt to capture both the significance of Curie's discoveries and her own personal struggles.\n\nIt's so strange how poor this film is, given the immense talent behind it. On screen, Rosamund Pike and Sam Riley star, while Persepolis director Marjane Satrapi helms the film. Yet despite that talent, Radioactive feels almost amateurish at its worst.\n\nIts screenplay is poor throughout, from its lack of dramatic insight to its consistently terrible dialogue. The early moments of the film are insufferable, chronicling Marie's meeting with future husband Pierre through scenes of awkward and forced scientific flirting.\n\nLater on, Radioactive tries to grab your attention with its assessment of the standing of women in the scientific community, but does little to make that theme really get under your skin. In fact, the most memorable part of that theme is Curie's repeated assertions that it was not her gender that stood most in her way as a scientist at the time, but her background and funds.\n\nAnd with relatively little focus on her background, there isn't much of an inspiring, uplifting arc for Curie here. Instead, there are a few eureka moments interspersed by long, dry and dull periods with barely any memorable drama to show.\n\nEven stranger is the way in which the film tries to represent the long-term, controversial effects of Curie's discovery of radioactivity. Almost randomly, the film throws in bizarre vignettes from the future showing the uses of the discovery for good and bad, including the bombing of Hiroshima and the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThat all but ruins any narrative flow in the film, only reinforcing the fact that Radioactive really is a bit of an amateurish work. Marjane Satrapi's generally unappealing style and drab direction do little to keep you engaged, while even leads like Sam Riley and to an extent Rosamund Pike are below their best.\n\nIt's a real shame, because it's clear that Marie Curie's is a great story, and with so much talent working in this film, you would expect a whole lot more from Radioactive. But, as a painfully dull, stale and even amateurish biopic, there's little positive to say about it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Stale, rushed and lacking any insightful emotional depth, Radioactive is a dull watch throughout, failing in its attempt to capture both the significance of Curie's discoveries and her own personal struggles.\n\nIt's so strange how poor this film is, given the immense talent behind it. On screen, Rosamund Pike and Sam Riley star, while Persepolis director Marjane Satrapi helms the film. Yet despite that talent, Radioactive feels almost amateurish at its worst.\n\nIts screenplay is poor throughout, from its lack of dramatic insight to its consistently terrible dialogue. The early moments of the film are insufferable, chronicling Marie's meeting with future husband Pierre through scenes of awkward and forced scientific flirting.\n\nLater on, Radioactive tries to grab your attention with its assessment of the standing of women in the scientific community, but does little to make that theme really get under your skin. In fact, the most memorable part of that theme is Curie's repeated assertions that it was not her gender that stood most in her way as a scientist at the time, but her background and funds.\n\nAnd with relatively little focus on her background, there isn't much of an inspiring, uplifting arc for Curie here. Instead, there are a few eureka moments interspersed by long, dry and dull periods with barely any memorable drama to show.\n\nEven stranger is the way in which the film tries to represent the long-term, controversial effects of Curie's discovery of radioactivity. Almost randomly, the film throws in bizarre vignettes from the future showing the uses of the discovery for good and bad, including the bombing of Hiroshima and the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThat all but ruins any narrative flow in the film, only reinforcing the fact that Radioactive really is a bit of an amateurish work. Marjane Satrapi's generally unappealing style and drab direction do little to keep you engaged, while even leads like Sam Riley and to an extent Rosamund Pike are below their best.\n\nIt's a real shame, because it's clear that Marie Curie's is a great story, and with so much talent working in this film, you would expect a whole lot more from Radioactive. But, as a painfully dull, stale and even amateurish biopic, there's little positive to say about it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made","reviewBody":"I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2: The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by no-talents. In comparison, The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers, the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.\n\nWith The Love Guru, you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers, but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing, we get the Guru Pitka, a Charles Manson look-alike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about "life" or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters, where the Guru doesn't really have any character; he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.\n\nSpeaking of plot, the storyline is almost as ill-conceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every cliché ever known to cinema-goers, but it is. The Guru has a self-revelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course, Blur's "Song 2" plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used (and groan-inducing) tune for any sports-related film.\n\nEven if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as "Dick Pants" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of "TM" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's "9 to 5", the other a ear-splitting variation on "Space Cowboy" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).\n\nThe other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.\n\nIt really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy, yes, but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley. Instead, it's the worst movie of the year for sure (leaving Meet the Spartans way behind in its dust) and has reached it's place, for me at least, as the worst movie ever created. It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.8},"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made","reviewBody":"I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2: The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by no-talents. In comparison, The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers, the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.\n\nWith The Love Guru, you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers, but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing, we get the Guru Pitka, a Charles Manson look-alike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about "life" or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters, where the Guru doesn't really have any character; he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.\n\nSpeaking of plot, the storyline is almost as ill-conceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every cliché ever known to cinema-goers, but it is. The Guru has a self-revelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course, Blur's "Song 2" plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used (and groan-inducing) tune for any sports-related film.\n\nEven if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as "Dick Pants" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of "TM" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's "9 to 5", the other a ear-splitting variation on "Space Cowboy" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).\n\nThe other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.\n\nIt really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy, yes, but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley. Instead, it's the worst movie of the year for sure (leaving Meet the Spartans way behind in its dust) and has reached it's place, for me at least, as the worst movie ever created. It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.8,"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Faris is wonderful in her role as the dimwitted bunny who has more than enough smarts to learn a few new tricks and Hanks, in a smaller role, is quite nice as the love interest. The Zeta girls themselves, especially Rumer Willis and Emma Stone, are a delightful bunch of offbeat creatures that learn some lessons themselves. The rest of the cast, including Christopher McDonald and Beverly D'Angelo, is good, also.

It is going to be Shelley's biggest challenge to turn the sorority into an attractive place for the new students. Can she do it? Perhaps, Shelly could ask for the help and advice of a nursing home director, Oliver (Colin Hanks), a nice man she met in a park? After a brief, blase beginning, this film packs a good punch of light comedy and romance. Part of the credit should go to the very nice cast. Faris is wonderful in her role as the dimwitted bunny who has more than enough smarts to learn a few new tricks and Hanks, in a smaller role, is quite nice as the love interest. The Zeta girls themselves, especially Rumer Willis and Emma Stone, are a delightful bunch of offbeat creatures that learn some lessons themselves. The rest of the cast, including Christopher McDonald and Beverly D'Angelo, is good, also. The costumes, naturally, are very fine, as this is a gal-dominated movie and clothes are especially important. But, the sunny sets, cinematography, screenplay, and direction are up to snuff as well. No, it's not Willie Shakespeare but the flick is definitely a good diversion from the everyday blues. It's a likely bet that you will find this "Bunny" to be quite funny indeed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As she relates, no one was interested in getting her back although they did request that the basket be returned! Shuttled from one orphanage to another, Shelley eventually found a "family" when her womanish figure came into fruition. That's right, Shelley resided in the Playboy mansion and found happiness with Hef and the other gal pal housemates. However, one day Shelley receives word that Hef has given her two hours to move out of the mansion. A fellow worker at the residence suggests that, perhaps, she is getting too old to be a bunny.

The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made","reviewBody":"I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2: The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by no-talents. In comparison, The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers, the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.\n\nWith The Love Guru, you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers, but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing, we get the Guru Pitka, a Charles Manson look-alike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about "life" or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters, where the Guru doesn't really have any character; he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.\n\nSpeaking of plot, the storyline is almost as ill-conceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every cliché ever known to cinema-goers, but it is. The Guru has a self-revelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course, Blur's "Song 2" plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used (and groan-inducing) tune for any sports-related film.\n\nEven if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as "Dick Pants" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of "TM" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's "9 to 5", the other a ear-splitting variation on "Space Cowboy" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).\n\nThe other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.\n\nIt really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy, yes, but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley. Instead, it's the worst movie of the year for sure (leaving Meet the Spartans way behind in its dust) and has reached it's place, for me at least, as the worst movie ever created. It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.8},"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I think that perhaps these comments reflect both the lack of an adequate attention span and a lack of a proper knowledge and perspective of the times. "The Remains of the Day" requires both. I found it to be an interesting movie with many facets, each of which could be used as the sole theme of a movie. It is a movie that has great acting, is beautifully filmed in and around one of England's great mansions, and tells a fascinating and complex story as well.\n\nIt is true that the movie is about, in part, what many in the audience would believe is a romance that never has a chance because of Mr. Stevens' devotion to and pride in the occupation he has chosen. It is important to recognize that it is the job of his choosing, not one that has been forced upon him. It is tempting to write the job off as no more than servant of the wealthy, but it is actually the equivalent of presidency of a small company. Stevens is in charge of seeing that the large staff serving Darlington gets all of the many jobs in the household done - to perfection - every day of the week. I doubt that the White House has standards that approach those of Lord Darlington. So, each viewer can decide for himself or herself whether there could have ever been a woman in Stevens' life to whom he could give husband-like devotion.\n\nDarlington is not a Nazi sympathizer. He is a man who exhibits the ideals of 20th century Britain: honor, fairness, and full devotion to what is right. He believes, most would say correctly, that the Treaty of Versailles was unduly harsh in its treatment of post-WWI Germany. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize, as many Americans do now, that unfairness in the past cannot be rectified by stupid policies in the present. So, by seeking what he considers fairness for Germany in the 1930's, when Hitler's evil and expansionist aims should have been clearly evident, he and others set the stage for a world-wide conflict that cost 60 million lives, of which the lives lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki constitute less than one-half of one percent.\n\nOne of my tests of a movie is how far into it I start looking at my watch. In this case I began looking at my watch not to see how much more I had to sit through: rather, I was hoping to assure myself that there was enough movie left to provide a satisfactory ending. There was: however, I could have enjoyed much more of the talent and story I was seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68235,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I think that perhaps these comments reflect both the lack of an adequate attention span and a lack of a proper knowledge and perspective of the times. "The Remains of the Day" requires both. I found it to be an interesting movie with many facets, each of which could be used as the sole theme of a movie. It is a movie that has great acting, is beautifully filmed in and around one of England's great mansions, and tells a fascinating and complex story as well.\n\nIt is true that the movie is about, in part, what many in the audience would believe is a romance that never has a chance because of Mr. Stevens' devotion to and pride in the occupation he has chosen. It is important to recognize that it is the job of his choosing, not one that has been forced upon him. It is tempting to write the job off as no more than servant of the wealthy, but it is actually the equivalent of presidency of a small company. Stevens is in charge of seeing that the large staff serving Darlington gets all of the many jobs in the household done - to perfection - every day of the week. I doubt that the White House has standards that approach those of Lord Darlington. So, each viewer can decide for himself or herself whether there could have ever been a woman in Stevens' life to whom he could give husband-like devotion.\n\nDarlington is not a Nazi sympathizer. He is a man who exhibits the ideals of 20th century Britain: honor, fairness, and full devotion to what is right. He believes, most would say correctly, that the Treaty of Versailles was unduly harsh in its treatment of post-WWI Germany. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize, as many Americans do now, that unfairness in the past cannot be rectified by stupid policies in the present. So, by seeking what he considers fairness for Germany in the 1930's, when Hitler's evil and expansionist aims should have been clearly evident, he and others set the stage for a world-wide conflict that cost 60 million lives, of which the lives lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki constitute less than one-half of one percent.\n\nOne of my tests of a movie is how far into it I start looking at my watch. In this case I began looking at my watch not to see how much more I had to sit through: rather, I was hoping to assure myself that there was enough movie left to provide a satisfactory ending. There was: however, I could have enjoyed much more of the talent and story I was seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68235,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some people : Julia Roberts in a romantic comedy could be pretty slushy stuff; but then again if you watch it wanting that sort of thing you're likely to be disappointed.  Yes, so it is romantic and even a bit slushy at times, but has a sharp script and fast pace which keep you amused 95% of the time.\n\nOne of the things which appealed to me was the way moments of melodrama were defused into comedy - check out the two girls' confrontation with an audience of women (gathered by the call "Catfight!") whose oohs and aahs forestall any emotional reaction we ourselves may have to the scene.\n\nSome of the camerawork is also more interesting than one might expect, with particularly powerful close-ups where one or two faces fill the screen. Julia Roberts' beauty comes through in a long shot which starts to look like a shampoo commercial: long curly hair spills around her head as she lies in despair on the floor (the public safety message being, don't ever sit with your back against a door which an irate ex-lover might wrench open at any minute); nevertheless, the proximity gives us an intimacy with her character we might otherwise miss.\n\nAnother effective shot of this kind (two heads on a pillow fill the screen) drives home the theme touched on here of the devastatingly attractive gay man who is made doubly so by his inaccessibility (as more fully explored in "Object of my Affection").  George (Rupert Everett) is a fantastic character whose sense of fun, wisdom, sensitivity and English accent make him every girls' ideal object for unrequited love (or maybe it's just me ).\n\nThe disappointing aspect for me was the film's final affirmation of sexist values and a rather superficial and one-sided view of "real" love - but you 'll have to watch it to see if you agree with me on that.  Basically in my opinion, some of the ending lacked the self-awareness and sharpness of the rest of the film.  However, overall I would recommend it for an amusing and sometimes clever 90 minutes of celluloid.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Baseball may be a minor sport globally, its rules lost on the vast majority of Europeans, Africans and Asians, but in cinema it lends itself perfectly to myth and grand narrative. Pragmatic GM Billy Beane comes across a nerdy Peter Brand who seems to have worked out an algorithm to get the most effective baseball squad for the lowest cost. This is just what the cash-strapped Oakland franchise needs, decides Beane.

Baseball may be a minor sport globally, its rules lost on the vast majority of Europeans, Africans and Asians, but in cinema it lends itself perfectly to myth and grand narrative. Pragmatic GM Billy Beane comes across a nerdy Peter Brand who seems to have worked out an algorithm to get the most effective baseball squad for the lowest cost. This is just what the cash-strapped Oakland franchise needs, decides Beane. Philosophy meets strategy in a perfect pairing, as Billy and Peter go to work implementing 'moneyball' with an almost religious zeal. Pitt brings his now taken-for-granted charisma and complexity to Beane.

The film not only shows what can happen to human beings when they let go of any sense of conscience, but it is also a metaphor of the amoral mentality that was behind the Viet Nam conflict and its aftermath.\n\nThe struggle depicted here is between going along with the group or maintaining one's own integrity. Are there rules of war? Are there rules of living? These are the profound questions which underlie the action in this disturbing film."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41820,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Iceal Hambleton (Gene Hackman) je američki stručnjak raketnog naoružanja koji ostaje zarobljen iza vijetnamskih neprijateljskih linija nakon što njegov izviđački avion biva oboren. Tijekom vijetnamskog rata, američki izviđački avion je pogođen raketom. Jedini preživjeli je potpukovnik Iceal Hambleton, stručnjak za raketno naoružanje. Zbog njegovog znanja jako je bitno izbaviti ga odatle prije nego što ga se Vijetkokongovci dočepaju. Zadatak je izuzetno složen pogotovo zato što neprijatelj prisluškuje njegovu radio-komunikaciju.</desc>

Even more so because "Dark Blue" also promises to focus regularly on the characters' personal lives. I don't see how they can do this effectively if they rush through each and every episode.

Doc would really have been only a fringe character if it wasn't for the fact he was played by James Belushie in fine form, he fits into the role of the degenerate with ease, he begins as somewhat uptight, but slowly dissolves into the seedy culture of Salvador in contrast to Boyle being ostracised by everyone he deals with.\n\nAs with most Stone biopics, there is an element of "you weren't there man!" anger as he unleashed another tirade against the US government and military through this film. You can take that as you like, what I found most fascinating about this film is the similarity to Fear and Loathing, right down to the battered red car they make most of the journey in. I found it fascinating that Boyle could live the kind of story that Thompson made his name creating, the two would make a cracking team, should they not die getting the story, just make it up.\n\nIf you're undecided on Olly Stone, but haven't seen this film, give it a try before you decide whether he is an overrated paranoid madman or an impassioned filmmaker with a message in there somewhere if you can get past all the shouting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That's what you'll be doing after you see this film. Contagion is a frightening realistic procedural thriller about the spread of an airborne pandemic virus, its impact on an ensemble cast of characters played by a veritable 'Who's Who' of Hollywood and the subsequent race to find a cure.\n\nLike his earlier work 'Traffic', Soderbergh skilfully interweaves the various story lines into a bigger picture that breathlessly tracks and encircles the globe. The cast do not let him down. It's impossible to see a bad performance from Matt Damon and once again his role as a grieving father is sensitively and painfully played. We really feel his sense of sudden and unexpected loss as he struggles to internalise the news of his wife's death, disbelieving, dazed and confused. Marion Cotillard adds an international hue to her role as a World Health Organisation investigator whilst Jude Law plays the role of an insidious Australian blogger, who dangerously undermines the medical establishment's attempts to find a cure for his own conspiratorial and financial gains, to perfection. I could go on; Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle and John Hawkes all provide solid support in a starry cast.\n\nWhat makes this film so compelling is the way Soderbergh is able to show how unhygienic human beings are and how easy it is to create a pandemic. In hundreds of different absent minded ways we touch our faces on a daily basis and in doing so, transfer and spread dangerous viruses amongst ourselves. Next time you're in the supermarket look out for the number of people who pick their noses, wipe their mouths and cough, sneeze and splutter their way past you without any attempts to cover their mouths. They're picking up (and putting back) the fruit and vegetables, handling groceries and even touching your hand when supermarket staff are giving back your card or change! Worse still, a recent survey showed that although 95% of people say they wash their hands, only 12% actually do so and consequently 1 in 6 mobile phones have faecal bacterial on them and 30% of all handbags. I could go on.\n\nDespite a slightly preposterous storyline when Cotillard is kidnapped in Hong Kong, Soderbergh does portray the breakdown of society in an uncomfortably truthful way when people are suddenly and unexpectedly faced with their own extinction and the instincts of self preservation take over. This could have been explored a little further around the world although at all times the story is grounded in reality. Even the death toll of 27 million worldwide in four months has the ring of truth about it and this is due in no small part to the film's chief scientific adviser, Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University. The televised national lottery in the film is something that I could see happening in the interests of fairness and impartiality when the supply of vaccines is unable to keep up with demand when life and death is only one injection away.\n\nAt the film's closing credits one thing stands out and that is the unheralded and heroic work of the thousands of doctors, microbiologists, virologists and vaccine researchers around the world who labour night and day to minimise the effects of such a pandemic occurring which might wipe out the human race. If you're a pessimist like me in this age of global warming, massive deforestation, the depletion of the earth's natural resources, the extinction of wildlife habitats, overpopulation and overcrowding, go figure...a pandemic like the one portrayed in Contagion is inevitable (and long overdue according to the scientific world). The only question that remains is how many people will it kill? Anyway, go and see the film – it's a thought provoking and scary chiller that taps into the current zeitgeist."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288406,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Contagion is a frightening realistic procedural thriller about the spread of an airborne pandemic virus, its impact on an ensemble cast of characters played by a veritable 'Who's Who' of Hollywood and the subsequent race to find a cure.\n\nLike his earlier work 'Traffic', Soderbergh skilfully interweaves the various story lines into a bigger picture that breathlessly tracks and encircles the globe. The cast do not let him down. It's impossible to see a bad performance from Matt Damon and once again his role as a grieving father is sensitively and painfully played. We really feel his sense of sudden and unexpected loss as he struggles to internalise the news of his wife's death, disbelieving, dazed and confused. Marion Cotillard adds an international hue to her role as a World Health Organisation investigator whilst Jude Law plays the role of an insidious Australian blogger, who dangerously undermines the medical establishment's attempts to find a cure for his own conspiratorial and financial gains, to perfection. I could go on; Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle and John Hawkes all provide solid support in a starry cast.\n\nWhat makes this film so compelling is the way Soderbergh is able to show how unhygienic human beings are and how easy it is to create a pandemic. In hundreds of different absent minded ways we touch our faces on a daily basis and in doing so, transfer and spread dangerous viruses amongst ourselves. Next time you're in the supermarket look out for the number of people who pick their noses, wipe their mouths and cough, sneeze and splutter their way past you without any attempts to cover their mouths. They're picking up (and putting back) the fruit and vegetables, handling groceries and even touching your hand when supermarket staff are giving back your card or change! Worse still, a recent survey showed that although 95% of people say they wash their hands, only 12% actually do so and consequently 1 in 6 mobile phones have faecal bacterial on them and 30% of all handbags. I could go on.\n\nDespite a slightly preposterous storyline when Cotillard is kidnapped in Hong Kong, Soderbergh does portray the breakdown of society in an uncomfortably truthful way when people are suddenly and unexpectedly faced with their own extinction and the instincts of self preservation take over. This could have been explored a little further around the world although at all times the story is grounded in reality. Even the death toll of 27 million worldwide in four months has the ring of truth about it and this is due in no small part to the film's chief scientific adviser, Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University. The televised national lottery in the film is something that I could see happening in the interests of fairness and impartiality when the supply of vaccines is unable to keep up with demand when life and death is only one injection away.\n\nAt the film's closing credits one thing stands out and that is the unheralded and heroic work of the thousands of doctors, microbiologists, virologists and vaccine researchers around the world who labour night and day to minimise the effects of such a pandemic occurring which might wipe out the human race. If you're a pessimist like me in this age of global warming, massive deforestation, the depletion of the earth's natural resources, the extinction of wildlife habitats, overpopulation and overcrowding, go figure...a pandemic like the one portrayed in Contagion is inevitable (and long overdue according to the scientific world). The only question that remains is how many people will it kill? Anyway, go and see the film – it's a thought provoking and scary chiller that taps into the current zeitgeist.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288406,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Just why his career subsequently went in the direction it did is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood. Voight and Roberts are supported by Rebecca De Mornay, super tough guy John P. Ryan ('It's Alive') and well loved character actor Kenneth McMillan. Also keep an eye out for Danny Trejo in the boxing sequence towards the very beginning of the film. 'Runaway Train' is a movie I never tire of watching. The interplay between Voight and Roberts is wonderful to watch, the action sequences are breathtaking, and the ending is one of the all time greats!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27430,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That's what you'll be doing after you see this film. Contagion is a frightening realistic procedural thriller about the spread of an airborne pandemic virus, its impact on an ensemble cast of characters played by a veritable 'Who's Who' of Hollywood and the subsequent race to find a cure.\n\nLike his earlier work 'Traffic', Soderbergh skilfully interweaves the various story lines into a bigger picture that breathlessly tracks and encircles the globe. The cast do not let him down. It's impossible to see a bad performance from Matt Damon and once again his role as a grieving father is sensitively and painfully played. We really feel his sense of sudden and unexpected loss as he struggles to internalise the news of his wife's death, disbelieving, dazed and confused. Marion Cotillard adds an international hue to her role as a World Health Organisation investigator whilst Jude Law plays the role of an insidious Australian blogger, who dangerously undermines the medical establishment's attempts to find a cure for his own conspiratorial and financial gains, to perfection. I could go on; Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle and John Hawkes all provide solid support in a starry cast.\n\nWhat makes this film so compelling is the way Soderbergh is able to show how unhygienic human beings are and how easy it is to create a pandemic. In hundreds of different absent minded ways we touch our faces on a daily basis and in doing so, transfer and spread dangerous viruses amongst ourselves. Next time you're in the supermarket look out for the number of people who pick their noses, wipe their mouths and cough, sneeze and splutter their way past you without any attempts to cover their mouths. They're picking up (and putting back) the fruit and vegetables, handling groceries and even touching your hand when supermarket staff are giving back your card or change! Worse still, a recent survey showed that although 95% of people say they wash their hands, only 12% actually do so and consequently 1 in 6 mobile phones have faecal bacterial on them and 30% of all handbags. I could go on.\n\nDespite a slightly preposterous storyline when Cotillard is kidnapped in Hong Kong, Soderbergh does portray the breakdown of society in an uncomfortably truthful way when people are suddenly and unexpectedly faced with their own extinction and the instincts of self preservation take over. This could have been explored a little further around the world although at all times the story is grounded in reality. Even the death toll of 27 million worldwide in four months has the ring of truth about it and this is due in no small part to the film's chief scientific adviser, Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University. The televised national lottery in the film is something that I could see happening in the interests of fairness and impartiality when the supply of vaccines is unable to keep up with demand when life and death is only one injection away.\n\nAt the film's closing credits one thing stands out and that is the unheralded and heroic work of the thousands of doctors, microbiologists, virologists and vaccine researchers around the world who labour night and day to minimise the effects of such a pandemic occurring which might wipe out the human race. If you're a pessimist like me in this age of global warming, massive deforestation, the depletion of the earth's natural resources, the extinction of wildlife habitats, overpopulation and overcrowding, go figure...a pandemic like the one portrayed in Contagion is inevitable (and long overdue according to the scientific world). The only question that remains is how many people will it kill? Anyway, go and see the film – it's a thought provoking and scary chiller that taps into the current zeitgeist."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288406,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The 2011 semi-grindhouse film DRIVE ANGRY is pretty much one of those throwaways. I don't mean it's a crappy movie. There's enough here to keep the film somewhat entertaining if you're looking for some mindless fun. I suppose it might've been even better in 3D. From what I remember, this film was actually filmed with 3D cameras as opposed to the crappy post-conversion process. I've only seen it in 2D, so I couldn't tell you if the extra dimension adding anything to the experience. The story is straight out of the world of grindhouse: Nicholas Cage is John Milton, a man who's escaped from Hell, and he's on a mission. His daughter was murdered by the insane leader of a Satanic cult, and this same maniac has plans on sacrificing Milton's newborn grandchild in a ritual to open a gateway between Hell and Earth. But Milton didn't leave Hell alone...there's a mysterious figure known only as the Accountant on his tail with the intention of taking Milton back.\n\nSounds cool, huh? It sort of is. The movie's loaded with crazy action and violence, including a gun battle in a motel room while Milton chugs a bottle of whiskey and continues getting freaky with a barmaid while gunning down multiple opponents. The scene alone should earn this movie awesome status. It probably would if there were more scenes as off-the-wall as this one. The final confrontation where Milton reminds us why the film is titled DRIVE ANGRY is pretty crazy, but the rest of the action in the movie is nothing we haven't seen before. The action also suffers from weak effects. The movie had a $50 million budget but I guess it all went into the car chases. Seriously, cars are exploding at the slightest hit and there's plenty of opportunities for tossing cars here. What CG is in the movie, is generally pretty terrible. When Milton uses his "god-killer" in the finale, I nearly laughed at a moment when we're supposed to be cheering. When it comes to gore effects, I always prefer practical over CG and the practical effects in this film, while not always perfect, were much better.\n\nI understand that this film is following in the recent trend of bringing the grindhouse film back to mainstream (not that that's a bad thing, e.g. GRINDHOUSE, HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN), but even characters in a grindhouse film need to be interesting. Milton's character has a cool premise: he's busted out of Hell. So why is his character so boring? Cage delivers his lines with the energy of someone whose just been woken from his afternoon nap. For a man who's escaped from the bowels of the underworld, he sure doesn't have a whole lot of passion for his mission. Someone should've reminded him the movie's called DRIVE ANGRY, not DRIVE PEEVED. Amber Heard is a waitress who finds herself drawn into Milton's quest and, in addition to providing some amazing eye candy, is the only one who seems to care what's going on. The real scene-stealers in this movie are the villains. Billy Burke is downright creepy as cult leader Jonah King with his Southern drawl and a self-righteous attitude that convinces his followers that this man knows what he's doing. More than anyone, the best performance in the film comes from William Fichtner as the Accountant. He's mysterious (instant cool points for any character) and deadly, cool and calm as he trails Milton and dispatching anyone who gets in his way without breaking a sweat. It's just business as usual for this Hell minion.\n\nThe film really has all the best grindhouse staples: gratuitous violence, T&amp;A, awful dialogue, and car chases with plenty of explosions. The problem is, when a scene isn't giving us one or more of these things, it slows to a crawl and I kept losing interest. The dialogue is pretty terrible and any attempt at delivering exposition or expressing emotion falls flat. So keep it short and keep the pace moving fast to get us to the next action scene. In the end, the movie is just forgettable. It's fun enough to watch, but I doubt it'll be leaving a lasting impression with anyone. Not Cage's best, but at least it's not THE WICKER MAN.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel "The Hellbound Heart". The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...\n\nThe main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're "too gory" or "stupid" - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.\n\nA writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film - but Hellraiser has none of it! The entire cast shine, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.\n\nOverall, I have pointed out a couple of flaws here; but I really can't bring myself to give this masterpiece any less than full marks. The originality on display throughout Hellraiser is astounding, as is the atmosphere and the performances pulled out of the actors, along with the fact that this film has entertained me many times and is still as good today as the first time I saw it. All of this ensures that Hellraiser will be an endearing favourite of mine for the rest of my life. If you consider yourself a fan of horror and haven't seen this; shame on you. Make sure you read the book, too!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106742,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel "The Hellbound Heart". The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...\n\nThe main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're "too gory" or "stupid" - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.\n\nA writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film - but Hellraiser has none of it! The entire cast shine, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.\n\nOverall, I have pointed out a couple of flaws here; but I really can't bring myself to give this masterpiece any less than full marks. The originality on display throughout Hellraiser is astounding, as is the atmosphere and the performances pulled out of the actors, along with the fact that this film has entertained me many times and is still as good today as the first time I saw it. All of this ensures that Hellraiser will be an endearing favourite of mine for the rest of my life. If you consider yourself a fan of horror and haven't seen this; shame on you. Make sure you read the book, too!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106742,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

(I was ten) This film furthers the saga of the Brody family as sons Sean and Mike are now fully grown and moved away from Amity Island. Sean does something in Colorado if I recall, and Mike is (heh, heh, heh,) an underwater welder who just finished construction of an undersea kingdom at Sea World in Florida. Just when the park is about to have a grand opening, some uninvited guests show up. They being a 35-foot great white shark and her offspring. Needless to say, some people get eaten.\n\nThis film was originally going to be made as spoof of the previous two films. I'm not sure if any type of a finished script to that effect exists, but it would be worth a look. Jaws 3D ends up being another serious monster movie with a disaster movie subplot. Not only does the shark eat a bunch of people, it also traps several others in the underwater part of the park. The race is on to save the people and kill the mother shark. Her baby dies midway through after it is captured and hastily put on display in the park. The conclusion is fairly exciting, and full of bloody carnage.\n\nThe cast is one of the stronger points of the film. Dennis Quaid is the fearless Mike Brody. Bess Armstrong plays the park's head biologist and Quaid's love interest. (The real sparks were apparently flying between Quaid and Lea Thompson off camera, though!) Thompson plays a water skier at the park, and John Putch plays Sean Brody who falls for her. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarity play a couple of Englishmen who show up and help battle the sharks. By far the best performance is turned in by Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. He plays the owner/manager/president (I'm really not sure which) of the park. He has a terrific moment as he addresses the park guests in the underwater tunnels over the p.a. system. He turns on the fake executive public relations charm and asks them all to calmly exit the park just as the giant shark is bearing down on them.\n\nThe individuals who play Dan and Liz left a lot to be desired. Since no other film credits are listed for them, one would have to conclude that they actually worked at Sea World and were given these roles since this is what they do on a daily basis. Maybe they still work there. Anyone know? The sharks look pretty good in most of the scenes. Except at the very end when the shark is lodged into the control room and its tail is sticking out. That looked incredibly fake. In addition, sharks must always stay moving in the water or they'll die. They can't just lay low in huge underwater structures waiting to pounce on their victims. They usually strike from directly underneath their victims in most attack scenarios. The big shark in this film also has the ability to growl and roar, but not as loudly as the one in part IV! The 3D effect looked very good in the theater, but films like this lose quite a bit of their luster on the TV screen. You're only left with a bunch of gag shots that were supposed to scare viewers in the theater, but now look ludicrous and forced.\n\nThis film made some pretty decent $ in its theatrical run, and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on, and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period, give this film a try. But be forewarned: Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made.

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Serija "Seinfeld" opravdano se etablirala kao jedna od najuspješnijih i najpopularnijih humorističnih serija u povijesti televizije. Takozvana "serija o ničemu" uspjela je redefinirati žanr humorističnih serija gotovo preko noći. "Seinfeld" je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emmyja, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj malen u usporedbi s višemilijunskim auditorijem koji je svakog tjedna sjedao pred TV kako bi vidio što Njemu večeras smeta. Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Neurotičan lik kojeg je Jerry Seinfeld stvorio, ili je možda takav i u stvarnosti, izrodio je zvijezdu iz svakog lika samca koji se pojavio u nekom odnosu s njim. Jerry, George, Elaine i Kramer glavni su protagonisti "serije o ničemu". Rasprava hoće li Jerryjev noćni posjet postati nova romantična avantura, pljačka Jerryjevog stana, izbjegavanje susreta sa starim prijateljima do trgovine dionicama tek su neke od tema koje će zabaviti gledatelje u prvoj sezoni Seinfelda.</desc>

Umoran od života u Emmitovoj sjeni, Ray je proćelav, debeljuškast socijalni radnik koji je silno ogorčen kartama koje su mu podijeljene, a za to okrivljuje brata. Njihovo bratsko suparništvo vodi ih na krivi put koji počinje sitnim krađama, ali ubrzo dovodi do ubistava, mafijaša i surovog natjecateljskog bridža. Sitno suparništvo između dvojice braće eskalira i donosi haos maloj minesotskoj zajednici.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Umoran od života u Emmitovoj sjeni, Ray je proćelav, debeljuškast socijalni radnik koji je silno ogorčen kartama koje su mu podijeljene, a za to okrivljuje brata. Njihovo bratsko suparništvo vodi ih na krivi put koji počinje sitnim krađama, ali ubrzo dovodi do ubistava, mafijaša i surovog natjecateljskog bridža. Sitno suparništvo između dvojice braće eskalira i donosi haos maloj minesotskoj zajednici.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Serija "Seinfeld" opravdano se etablirala kao jedna od najuspješnijih i najpopularnijih humorističnih serija u povijesti televizije. Takozvana "serija o ničemu" uspjela je redefinirati žanr humorističnih serija gotovo preko noći. "Seinfeld" je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emmyja, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj malen u usporedbi s višemilijunskim auditorijem koji je svakog tjedna sjedao pred TV kako bi vidio što Njemu večeras smeta. Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Neurotičan lik kojeg je Jerry Seinfeld stvorio, ili je možda takav i u stvarnosti, izrodio je zvijezdu iz svakog lika samca koji se pojavio u nekom odnosu s njim. Jerry, George, Elaine i Kramer glavni su protagonisti "serije o ničemu". Rasprava hoće li Jerryjev noćni posjet postati nova romantična avantura, pljačka Jerryjevog stana, izbjegavanje susreta sa starim prijateljima do trgovine dionicama tek su neke od tema koje će zabaviti gledatelje u prvoj sezoni Seinfelda.</desc>

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Željan zarade, Grenvile smišlja razne nepromišljene planove za podsticanje kupaca da ostave što više novca, ali retko kad postiže očekivane rezultate.

Umoran od života u Emmitovoj sjeni, Ray je proćelav, debeljuškast socijalni radnik koji je silno ogorčen kartama koje su mu podijeljene, a za to okrivljuje brata. Njihovo bratsko suparništvo vodi ih na krivi put koji počinje sitnim krađama, ali ubrzo dovodi do ubistava, mafijaša i surovog natjecateljskog bridža. Sitno suparništvo između dvojice braće eskalira i donosi haos maloj minesotskoj zajednici.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>
