On je jeretik koji se namjerio razotkriti laži vjere; pobunjenik koji želi zbaciti elitističko društvo; izvanbračni sin koji žudi za priznanjem svog oca...Leonardo se zatiče usred oluje koja se spremala vijekovima, sukoba istine i laži, vjere i razuma, prošlosti i budućnosti. Njegove težnje protiv njega koriste onodobni protivnici - vabeći ga u igru zavođenja gdje ga najviše trebaju oni koji preziru njegov intelekt. Leonardo se bori protiv neprijatelja koji koriste povijest da bi potisnuli istinu. Heroj oboružan samo umom, Da Vinci se sam suprotstavlja tami u sebi, ali i tami oko sebe. Suočen s nesigurnom budućnošću, njegova potraga za znanjem gotovo ga uništava dok istražuje granice svog razuma. Da Vinci se okreće svom umu i pretvara u nezaustavljivu silu koja cijelu eru izvlači iz tame i gura prema svjetlu. Njegova priča postaje pogled u naš svijet i zove nas da se priključimo njegovoj borbi za slobodnu budućnost.</desc>

U svijetu gdje su misao i vjera kontrolisani, jedan čovjek bori se kako bi oslobodio znanje...Tajna istorija zapanjujućeg života Leonarda Da Vincija otkriva portret mladog čovjeka opterećenog nadljudskim umom. On je jeretik koji se namjerio razotkriti laži vjere; pobunjenik koji želi zbaciti elitističko društvo; izvanbračni sin koji žudi za priznanjem svog oca...Leonardo se zatiče usred oluje koja se spremala vijekovima, sukoba istine i laži, vjere i razuma, prošlosti i budućnosti. Njegove težnje protiv njega koriste onodobni protivnici - vabeći ga u igru zavođenja gdje ga najviše trebaju oni koji preziru njegov intelekt. Leonardo se bori protiv neprijatelja koji koriste povijest da bi potisnuli istinu. Heroj oboružan samo umom, Da Vinci se sam suprotstavlja tami u sebi, ali i tami oko sebe. Suočen s nesigurnom budućnošću, njegova potraga za znanjem gotovo ga uništava dok istražuje granice svog razuma. Da Vinci se okreće svom umu i pretvara u nezaustavljivu silu koja cijelu eru izvlači iz tame i gura prema svjetlu. Njegova priča postaje pogled u naš svijet i zove nas da se priključimo njegovoj borbi za slobodnu budućnost.</desc>

So the main character Walker played by Jared Padalecki, is kinda funny in a weird way. Firstly Padalecki is the worst actor in the entire show, and secondly, if you were a fan of Supernatural, you will keep expecting Dean Winchester to turn up at any minute, or some sort of monster. Not only is he typecast.. he is quite inflexible with his range of acting. Back to acting school Jared. But as 2021 goes.. it really is on par with a few of the shows coming out. So keep your expectations a little lower than normal, and you will be fine.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So the main character Walker played by Jared Padalecki, is kinda funny in a weird way. Firstly Padalecki is the worst actor in the entire show, and secondly, if you were a fan of Supernatural, you will keep expecting Dean Winchester to turn up at any minute, or some sort of monster. Not only is he typecast.. he is quite inflexible with his range of acting. Back to acting school Jared. But as 2021 goes.. it really is on par with a few of the shows coming out. So keep your expectations a little lower than normal, and you will be fine.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In some ways, it is. Men are still represented the same way -- to be blunt, idiots -- and it's still very targeted towards females.\n\nHowever what I found is that "Desperate Housewives" contains a very funny satirical, dark edge to its humor that elevates it above "Sex and the City" and some other such shows that were previously on television... as a result it can be enjoyed by men and women -- if you like dark suburban comedies such as "The War of the Roses" and "The 'burbs" you'll probably love this.\n\nIt centers around a neighborhood of housewives who are trying to figure out who may or may not have killed one of their friends, a woman who supposedly committed suicide.\n\nMeanwhile the show focuses on their relationships, trials and tribulations, mainly the character of Teri Hatcher, who is the one we are meant to feel the most sympathy for.\n\nAlthough "Desperate Housewives" is rather silly at times and perhaps a bit too smug and clever for its own good, I find it very easy to watch and one of the better entertainments available on television at the time. I'd recommend it to anyone who can appreciate absurd dark humor set in a realistic environment. It's just good fun!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In some ways, it is. Men are still represented the same way -- to be blunt, idiots -- and it's still very targeted towards females.\n\nHowever what I found is that "Desperate Housewives" contains a very funny satirical, dark edge to its humor that elevates it above "Sex and the City" and some other such shows that were previously on television... as a result it can be enjoyed by men and women -- if you like dark suburban comedies such as "The War of the Roses" and "The 'burbs" you'll probably love this.\n\nIt centers around a neighborhood of housewives who are trying to figure out who may or may not have killed one of their friends, a woman who supposedly committed suicide.\n\nMeanwhile the show focuses on their relationships, trials and tribulations, mainly the character of Teri Hatcher, who is the one we are meant to feel the most sympathy for.\n\nAlthough "Desperate Housewives" is rather silly at times and perhaps a bit too smug and clever for its own good, I find it very easy to watch and one of the better entertainments available on television at the time. I'd recommend it to anyone who can appreciate absurd dark humor set in a realistic environment. It's just good fun!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The characters are very refreshing and particularly Ryan Eggold is so endearing in his first remarkable role, I've actually never paid much attention to him before. I just hope it doesn't get cancelled prematurely, like it seems to be happening to all good shows lately that are not about superheroes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26097,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Both this film and Michael Bay's "The Rock" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.\n\nBut as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":402115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both this film and Michael Bay's "The Rock" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.\n\nBut as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":402115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In 2012, we are presented with, from what I can see, one film that asks a more debatable and better question; is it possible for two people that are vaguely attracted to one another to have a baby, and while raising it, make efforts to meet and see other people? I'll be completely honest and say I could not and would not ever want to do this, although the idea, when put on the table, immediately sparked my interest. Not only does the idea of having kids disinterest me completely at this point in time, but I find that plan sort of selfish and unfair on both the parents and the child. If the parents seek out relationships with other people, the inevitability of it all will be that one or both of the parents will become so caught up in the new relationship that they will dump the baby on the other person. And unfair for the child, because every baby deserves a prominent mom and dad figure in their life.\n\nFriends With Kids asks this question, using two couples and two very close friends as the subjects. The two friends are Jason (Adam Scott) and Julie (Jennifer Westfeldt, who serves as the writer, one of the six producers, and director), who have been the kind of people who are truly meant for each other, but neither one will wake up and realize it. Their friends are the collective Alex and Leslie (Chris O'Dowd and Maya Rudolph) and the intimate sex-hounds Ben and Missy (Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig, all four are Bridesmaids alumni). The film opens with them childless, happy, and even more ecstatic once Leslie announces that she will be having a baby at dinner at a luxurious New York restaurant.\n\nFour years later, the two couples have children and their marriages lack the intimacy and cheeriness they once bubbled with. The only two that still seem remotely happy are Jason and Julie, who both remain single and childless. After a disastrous party for Jason, the two talk over the idea of having children, something Julie has wanted for a while seeing as she is older than Jason. Jason and Julie figure that if they have a baby together and then proceed to move forward by dating other people, yet still taking care of the kid, their relationship as friends will not suffer.\n\nThey decide to do this on a whim and out of convenience, and nine months later, they have a child. Now here comes the inevitable part; they must support it yet are trying to seek out new people to date as well. Jason falls lust at first sight when he meets the offbeat and attractive Megan Fox's Mary Jane, and Julie can't seem to take her eyes off the rather cliché everyman, Kurt (Edward Burns).\n\nTheir friends are concerned for their behavior, mainly because they believe the having-a-child-without-plans-to-marry setup was an impulsive and foolish decision on their part. One area Friends With Kids absolutely wins at is its ability to have believable, real-life conversations that are projected through a mature, human scope. One of the most heartbreaking scenes involves Jason, a rather self-absorbed, egotistical character, confessing to Julie why they could never be together. This scene doesn't pull any punches. It genuinely makes its audience wince. No sight gags or one-liners involved.\n\nAnother perfect scene involved Jon Hamm's Ben lecturing Jason on why having a kid was a stupid idea on his part, and how the kid may grow up to be confused and troubled by not having two firm parental figures in his life. These are the scenes that create great humanity and drama between the characters, in an non-contrived, believable manner.\n\nFriends With Kids feels like an exercise in Woody Allen-esque filmmaking, right down to the intellectual characters and the subtle character the state of New York plays. It's charming, often quite poignant, and perhaps offers some keen insights about the idea of raising children that is often forgone in many modern romantic comedies. It's endearing and reassuring to see a picture so true to its "romantic comedy" title.\n\nStarring: Adam Scott, Jennifer Westfeldt, Chris O'Dowd, Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, and Jon Hamm.

The girls want to watch this to see Giulio Berruti, because he is handsome as ****. I'm a guy, 100% heterosexual, but if you deny that this man belongs to the top of our class, you are lying.\n\nThe acting is average. Every character looks like he is living in a fairy tale, so everyone is happy and starts singing at random and sometimes inappropriate moments. You notice that every actor in this movie is enjoying their work. They act playful and enthusiastic, so you can't help yourself smiling sometimes. The dark side of this acting style is that you don't take the more emotional moments very seriously. It's a happy-family-summer-musical-movie after all, so everything is going to be be okay. Oh yeah, the jokes are horrible though.\n\nThe movie itself is not that bad. I would call it a budget version of Mama Mia!, because the A-list actors were the main reason people wanted to see that. There's one location, one annoying girl and at the end a wedding with a 'twist' that won't surprise anyone.\n\nIt's extremely cheesy, but if you fancy a brainless movie night, this is not the worst choice you can make. Don't see it in theaters though, unless you want so see Berruti's abs in widescreen-size, and don't forget the alcohol so you can suddenly sing along with everything.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5158,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The girls want to watch this to see Giulio Berruti, because he is handsome as ****. I'm a guy, 100% heterosexual, but if you deny that this man belongs to the top of our class, you are lying.\n\nThe acting is average. Every character looks like he is living in a fairy tale, so everyone is happy and starts singing at random and sometimes inappropriate moments. You notice that every actor in this movie is enjoying their work. They act playful and enthusiastic, so you can't help yourself smiling sometimes. The dark side of this acting style is that you don't take the more emotional moments very seriously. It's a happy-family-summer-musical-movie after all, so everything is going to be be okay. Oh yeah, the jokes are horrible though.\n\nThe movie itself is not that bad. I would call it a budget version of Mama Mia!, because the A-list actors were the main reason people wanted to see that. There's one location, one annoying girl and at the end a wedding with a 'twist' that won't surprise anyone.\n\nIt's extremely cheesy, but if you fancy a brainless movie night, this is not the worst choice you can make. Don't see it in theaters though, unless you want so see Berruti's abs in widescreen-size, and don't forget the alcohol so you can suddenly sing along with everything.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5158,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives.

You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. (* out of * * * *)","reviewBody":"The Whole Ten Yards (2004) is a comedy dead zone. You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. Every moment in this movie, begs for a single laugh, and it's as if the actors- -some who were all so promising in the original film, The Whole Nine Yards (2000)- -were promised big paychecks if they were able to tag along with the film's script.\n\nThe Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, who's now living in obscurity with his wife, Jill (Amanda Peet). Both are having problems in their marriage due to (a) Jimmy's erectile dysfunction, (b) Jill's inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition to become a contract killer and (c) Jimmy's transformation into a male-like Martha Sterwart.\n\nMeanwhile Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky's (Matthew Perry) finds that goons have kidnapped his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and that they are led by Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the father of the mob boss (also played by Pollak in the original), who was eliminated in the original film. Oz tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt.\n\nWarner Bros. has been unsuccessful in making mobster-comedy movie sequels. Analyze This (1999) was a funny film, but the idea to make a sequel was unnecessary. The sequel, Analyze That (2002), was an attempt to stretch an idea beyond its natural shelf life.\n\nBut you have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it was a good move to make a sequel to The Whole Nine Yards, or why Matthew Perry, who is playing Chandler (from "Friends") again, is unlikely to have a movie career, and why the film has been toned down to a PG-13 rating (the film cheats us of another view of Peet's breasts).\n\nScreenwriter George Gallo, on the DVD commentary, evidently has no regrets. "I think this movie is very funny," he insists, "I wrote 80 pages of genius." Apparently the scathing reviews and paltry box office have done little to humble him, as he adds, "It's like a homicidal Three Stooges." \n\nWhen Hollywood lackluster sequels are meant to be made, Howard Deutch is the man to call. He's responsible for Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II (1998) and Grumpier Old Men (1995). Deutch has also directed John Hughes-produced film such as The Great Outdoors (1988), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Some Kind of Wonderful (1987). \n\nIn The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes &amp; Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it.\n\nBut, if you don't laugh at that, there's Kevin Pollack (again) in one of the most singularly bad performances I have ever seen in a movie. It fails by calling attention to its awfulness. His accent, his voice, his clothes, his clownish makeup all conspire to create a character who brings the movie to a halt every time he appears on the screen.\n\nThere's also the propensity of a 107-year old woman able to pass gas. Surely by now, you must be rolling in the aisles? No? Then, I will mention that Bruce Willis' character is often unpleasant. He puts on an apron and a head cloth during the early scenes, as if such a disguise would do anything other than call attention to himself.\n\nDeutch, on the DVD commentary, is quietly apologetic as he points out all the things he wished he'd changed. "I was always sorry we didn't cut this out, " he says of one scene, "I think the joke is over." And I should mention that some of the film's elements such as the film's violence (for example, a scene where a woman gets a slap to the face) don't blend well with the film's light "comedy." And if you're planning on seeing or watching The Whole Ten Yards someday, let me tell you, it's not worth seeing for a whole ten bucks on the big screen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He discovers that his name is Anthony Claire and he is married with Helen (Sarah Gadon), who is six-month pregnant. Adam meets Anthony but soon he realizes that it was a mistake since his counterpart has put his eyes on Mary. Soon their lives become entwined.\n\n"Enemy" is not a good movie, but has an intriguing story by José Saramago. For me, a good movie is able to present the story with neither the need of reading the novel not researching explanation in Internet. "Enemy" is a movie where the viewer needs to watch with attention, seek explanation in Internet (for example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9AWkqRwd1I provides a good explanation of the movie) and watch it again. Therefore the screenwriter fails in his script. Anyway it is intriguing and when you see it for the second time, it is worthwhile. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "O Homem Duplicado" ("The Duplicated Man")","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One day, he watches a rented DVD and sees an obscure supporting actor very alike to him and Adam becomes obsessed find him out. He discovers that his name is Anthony Claire and he is married with Helen (Sarah Gadon), who is six-month pregnant. Adam meets Anthony but soon he realizes that it was a mistake since his counterpart has put his eyes on Mary. Soon their lives become entwined.\n\n"Enemy" is not a good movie, but has an intriguing story by José Saramago. For me, a good movie is able to present the story with neither the need of reading the novel not researching explanation in Internet. "Enemy" is a movie where the viewer needs to watch with attention, seek explanation in Internet (for example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9AWkqRwd1I provides a good explanation of the movie) and watch it again. Therefore the screenwriter fails in his script. Anyway it is intriguing and when you see it for the second time, it is worthwhile. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "O Homem Duplicado" ("The Duplicated Man")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Apparently, Molière was released from debtors prison, and did not rejoin his acting company for several months. The movie provides us with a fictional reconstruction of what went on during that time span.\n\nLike many period films, this movie has high production values. The sets and costumes are glorious, and we are spared the usual obligatory images of filth and squalor. Instead, most of the film takes place in the château of the very wealthy M. Jourdain (Fabrice Luchini), and his dutiful--if somewhat bored--wife (Laura Morante). Ludivine Sagnier plays a wealthy young widow, the Marquise Célimène.\n\nThe plot revolves around M. Jourdain's worshipful love for the Marquise. The Marquise barely knows he exists and so M. Jourdain proposes to hire Molière to teach him how to make a good impression on the object of his desires. The Marquise is self-centered, vain, and proud, and M. Jourdain is a fool. However, he is a rich fool, and can afford to go where his whims take him. Molière accepts the job, and the film moves forward from there.\n\nRomain Duris is very good as Molière. He reminds me of Johnny Depp, and, like Depp, he overplays his role in a humorous and enjoyable way . Fabrice Luchini is excellent as M. Jourdain--a man who has a wonderful wife but lusts after an unattainable and unlikeable woman. Laura Morante is outstanding as the wife, who lives with luxury but not with love. Ms. Morante is Italian, so it's not clear to me whether her voice was dubbed. In any case, she plays her role with skill and subtlety, and she has a presence that lights up the screen. \n\nThis film will remind you of "Shakespeare in Love" and "Becoming Jane." It tries to correlate the artist's experiences--about which we can only speculate--with his or her art, about which we know a great deal. It is obviously unlikely that we will ever learn what led Austen or Shakespeare or Molière to write their masterpieces. Because this vacuum exists, writers and directors are free to speculate about events, and present these speculations to us in the form of movies. \n\nI enjoyed both "Shakespeare in Love" and "Becoming Jane," and I would put "Molière" into this same category--not a great film, but a very good film, and definitely worth seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6041,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ova topla emocionalna priča o prijateljstvu dvojice potpuno različitih muškaraca inspirirana je istinitim događajima i postala je najuspješniji francuski film svih vremena. Bogati aristokrat Philippe je kvadriplegičar koji unajmi mladića imenom Driss kao svog njegovatelja. Budući da je Driss iz imigrantske obitelji, nema kvalifikacija i nedavno je pušten iz zatvora, on je najmanje odgovarajući kandidat za taj posao. Ipak, njih dvojica spojit će glazbu Vivaldija i Earth, Wind and Fire, elegantnu dikciju i ulični govor, odijela i trenirke… Dva će se svijeta sukobiti i pomiriti, iz čega će se izroditi prijateljstvo koje je suludo, komično i snažno, jednako koliko i neočekivano.</desc>

Can't Americans, Europeans Mongols or Aryans be terrorist? Big head movie makers- knowingly- unknowingly- around the globe are promoting that Islam oriented citizens are dangerous. I don't understand, are we trying to shape a culture here? \n\nThis is not just about this movie, instead, I hate it every time when one offends or accuses the other no matter in what direction it flows.\n\nIf I keep aside those feeling, I will have to state that I liked all other aspects of this movie.

But I developed a different perception after watching the movie. It's worth the time at-least.\n\nI dislike how countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and other Islamic countries are portrayed in cinemas. Can't Americans, Europeans Mongols or Aryans be terrorist? Big head movie makers- knowingly- unknowingly- around the globe are promoting that Islam oriented citizens are dangerous. I don't understand, are we trying to shape a culture here? \n\nThis is not just about this movie, instead, I hate it every time when one offends or accuses the other no matter in what direction it flows.\n\nIf I keep aside those feeling, I will have to state that I liked all other aspects of this movie. But maybe bonding a little more between the viewer and Abbott (Milla Jovovich) would have had made the movie even better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31955,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He can make his action scenes impossibly crazy that makes the whole experience a none stop entertainment. Too bad there isn't any glass for him to break in a ridiculously stylish way like he did in his other films. At least we still get to see something interesting, like Abe's axe spinning, throwing a vampire up to the sky, and turning that horse stampede chase into a large scale sequence. The rest is not quite inspired, but it still makes a pretty awesome action film. Like I wish it has more that. It's still entertaining for some reason. The WETA visuals look obvious. It fits well to the director's crazy vision.\n\nIt's hard to recommend Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. It's not as ridiculous as the title. It connects to Lincoln's life in a serious way. They could have at least give a bit more campier and sillier tone to make this alternate version of Lincoln iconic. Even with an awesome director, energetic cast, and vampires that look scary and kill horrifyingly, it's still not a satisfying vampiric onslaught. It's not horrible or boring either.

Upon hearing of the news, Detroit police officer Axel Foley once again reunites with Taggart and Rosewood and assists with their investigations much to the dismay of the chief of police Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield)...\n\nCritically, the first Beverley Hills Cop film was a success and has remained a popular film even 30 + years later and having seen it recently I can see why as it had a winning combination of Eddie Murphy at the top of his game and good straight-man support from Reinhold and Ashton plus a serviceable story.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the second film offers all of the same things yet it never seems to get held in the same kind of light at this first film; perhaps the reason is that many purists have the belief that familiarity breeds contempt, but for me sometimes a bit of what you know can be a good thing.\n\nI have to concede that there were parts in the early stages of the film that I found to be a little overbearing; we know that Beverly Hills Cop and Murphy are both loud, but for about the first 20-30 minutes it was literally too much at times - I've always been a fan of Eddie Murphy's, but some of his early scenes were a little too loud and shouty and at times some of these moments came across as irritating. Thankfully things improve and settle down when he makes the trip to Beverly Hills which was a relief as I don't think my lugholes could have endure the loudness much longer.\n\nOnce the investigation begins it does become enjoyable and I have to admit that Axel's ingenuity in getting information from people (whether directly or indirectly) holds no bounds and is always fun to watch. Reinhold and Ashton are great once again in supporting roles and Gil Hill was always a good character who sadly only had a small role in this film.\n\nSadly what does let the film down slightly is Brigitte Nielsen who has never been much of an actress and basically recites her lines as though she's reading them from an autocue and I'm sorry but I never found her that 'sexy' either. Isn't it also interesting that Rosewood had posters of Rambo and Cobra in his house (2 Stallone films) all at the time when Stallone was married to Brigitte Nielsen and she had an affair with Tony Scott. I suspect Nielsen only got the role based on these factors making her appearance all the more uncomfortable and out of place for those who know too much. Prochnow fares better and at least manages to bring a little menace, but Stockwell is weak. Look out for a cameo from Chris Rock at an early point in his career and a more obvious cameo from the late Hugh Hefner.\n\nStill despite some off-set issues at least Tony Scott does a relatively good job on-set by providing the audience with plenty of spectacle and some solid action sequences. In my opinion this is every bit as good as the original film and I am a little bit perplexed as to why it seems to be looked upon less favourably than the original film. Simply put if you liked the first film then you'll enjoy this sequel.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110880,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Upon hearing of the news, Detroit police officer Axel Foley once again reunites with Taggart and Rosewood and assists with their investigations much to the dismay of the chief of police Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield)...\n\nCritically, the first Beverley Hills Cop film was a success and has remained a popular film even 30 + years later and having seen it recently I can see why as it had a winning combination of Eddie Murphy at the top of his game and good straight-man support from Reinhold and Ashton plus a serviceable story.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the second film offers all of the same things yet it never seems to get held in the same kind of light at this first film; perhaps the reason is that many purists have the belief that familiarity breeds contempt, but for me sometimes a bit of what you know can be a good thing.\n\nI have to concede that there were parts in the early stages of the film that I found to be a little overbearing; we know that Beverly Hills Cop and Murphy are both loud, but for about the first 20-30 minutes it was literally too much at times - I've always been a fan of Eddie Murphy's, but some of his early scenes were a little too loud and shouty and at times some of these moments came across as irritating. Thankfully things improve and settle down when he makes the trip to Beverly Hills which was a relief as I don't think my lugholes could have endure the loudness much longer.\n\nOnce the investigation begins it does become enjoyable and I have to admit that Axel's ingenuity in getting information from people (whether directly or indirectly) holds no bounds and is always fun to watch. Reinhold and Ashton are great once again in supporting roles and Gil Hill was always a good character who sadly only had a small role in this film.\n\nSadly what does let the film down slightly is Brigitte Nielsen who has never been much of an actress and basically recites her lines as though she's reading them from an autocue and I'm sorry but I never found her that 'sexy' either. Isn't it also interesting that Rosewood had posters of Rambo and Cobra in his house (2 Stallone films) all at the time when Stallone was married to Brigitte Nielsen and she had an affair with Tony Scott. I suspect Nielsen only got the role based on these factors making her appearance all the more uncomfortable and out of place for those who know too much. Prochnow fares better and at least manages to bring a little menace, but Stockwell is weak. Look out for a cameo from Chris Rock at an early point in his career and a more obvious cameo from the late Hugh Hefner.\n\nStill despite some off-set issues at least Tony Scott does a relatively good job on-set by providing the audience with plenty of spectacle and some solid action sequences. In my opinion this is every bit as good as the original film and I am a little bit perplexed as to why it seems to be looked upon less favourably than the original film. Simply put if you liked the first film then you'll enjoy this sequel.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110880,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Overall, the movie is generic and predictable. Cook and Alba do good jobs with a paper-thin script and add some great moments with the physical humor such as the flying dental tools and jump starting Dane Cook as seen in the trailer. However, this is also one of those movies where most of the best punchlines are in the trailer which is disappointing.\n\nExpect lots of nudity from everyone including Cook but not Alba. 'Chuck' comes well stocked with lots of naked girls and breast jokes. However, be warned if you're trying to make this a date movie and know there are some very crude parts to this movie.

Overall, the movie is generic and predictable. Cook and Alba do good jobs with a paper-thin script and add some great moments with the physical humor such as the flying dental tools and jump starting Dane Cook as seen in the trailer. However, this is also one of those movies where most of the best punchlines are in the trailer which is disappointing.\n\nExpect lots of nudity from everyone including Cook but not Alba. 'Chuck' comes well stocked with lots of naked girls and breast jokes. However, be warned if you're trying to make this a date movie and know there are some very crude parts to this movie. 'Chuck' definitely earns his 'R' rating.\n\nCook doesn't evolve much from 'Employee of the Month' here but he is enjoyable. Alba is decent at the comedy. Together they have a alright chemistry but the movie is so typical it takes away from the overall experience. \n\nOne last note. Cook's sidekick, played by Dan Fogler, is extremely annoying and ruins the momentum of the movie on more than one occasion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They didn't cut any major action sequences, the editing in general was better in the US version, and the actors who did the dubbing in the US version were 500% better than the ones who spoke English in the original (especially the woman who played Carmen--she had a gorgeous face, but her English was less convincing than Jackie's and she was a horrible actress to boot). Also, the new English dialog is MUCH better in Dimension's version, easily beating out the original's English dialoge as well as the subtitle translations of it's Cantonese and Turkish dialoge.\n\nFor instance, in an early scene where shop-clerk Jackie is demonstrating exercise equipment to a middle aged man and his hot young wife, the man becomes indignant over that attention Chan pays to his trophy spouse. In the original version, the translation of his complaint about Chan to the shop manager is "Is he a circus clown?" In the US version, he says, "Is he hitting on my wife?" which makes MUCH more sense (to americans anyway). \n\nOf course, the most unusual thing about this re-edit is that Dimension gave the film an entirely different story!  The original was about the chase for an ultra-lethal, weaponized pathogen called Anthrax II. Spy was set to come out right in the middle of our nation's big Anthrax scare, however, so that was out. In Dimension's remake, everyone is chasing after vials of a prototype drug 100 times more addictive than heroin. I say "six of one, half a dozen of the other." The chase is the important part in a Jackie Chan movie, not what everyone's running after.  In fact, the drug plot works much better in many ways.\n\nThe only thing they messed up was the very end of the film--a common problem for Dimension (see the awkward end of the US version of Legend of Drunken Master). Spy's original ending was both bittersweet and comic. The US version's chopped up ending is just jarringly abrupt and the explanation of the plot is even more nonsensical than the HK version (oddly enough, the "simple" US-version explanation is more unbelievable than the convoluted version in the original.). \n\nThe Accidental Spy is Chan's best HK film in years--great cinematography, slick set design, great action! A class act, as these things go."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16622,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The original was about the chase for an ultra-lethal, weaponized pathogen called Anthrax II. Spy was set to come out right in the middle of our nation's big Anthrax scare, however, so that was out. In Dimension's remake, everyone is chasing after vials of a prototype drug 100 times more addictive than heroin. I say "six of one, half a dozen of the other." The chase is the important part in a Jackie Chan movie, not what everyone's running after.  In fact, the drug plot works much better in many ways.\n\nThe only thing they messed up was the very end of the film--a common problem for Dimension (see the awkward end of the US version of Legend of Drunken Master). Spy's original ending was both bittersweet and comic. The US version's chopped up ending is just jarringly abrupt and the explanation of the plot is even more nonsensical than the HK version (oddly enough, the "simple" US-version explanation is more unbelievable than the convoluted version in the original.). \n\nThe Accidental Spy is Chan's best HK film in years--great cinematography, slick set design, great action! A class act, as these things go.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16622,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Often they choose strangely identifiable characters, which are played by highly competent actors. This show was much better than I expected. I really wondered how they were going to tie in code-breakers to a post-war world, and assumed it would be something to do with Russia. What a pleasant surprise to find these extraordinary women on the hunt for a serial killer. The science behind their quest was also extraordinary, and believe me, never suffers from the antiquated or mundane in terms of mind boggling genius in terms of their analytics. It's all very original indeed. The background is authentic 1950s and worth a look just for that. The social commentary was brilliant, though some may find it a little too extracurricular to the suspense of the main plot. The villain is good and evil, and I would have liked to have seen more of that, which is where my extra point disappeared. It would have given the story an extra kick to the suspense, which it needed, because a lot of the suspense was how husbands and other chaps would react to such aggressive role-breaking. It's a tiny criticism. This is truly a wonderful show. If you love excellent period piece BBC crime drama, then you are in for a treat when you discover The Bletchley Circle.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Often they choose strangely identifiable characters, which are played by highly competent actors. This show was much better than I expected. I really wondered how they were going to tie in code-breakers to a post-war world, and assumed it would be something to do with Russia. What a pleasant surprise to find these extraordinary women on the hunt for a serial killer. The science behind their quest was also extraordinary, and believe me, never suffers from the antiquated or mundane in terms of mind boggling genius in terms of their analytics. It's all very original indeed. The background is authentic 1950s and worth a look just for that. The social commentary was brilliant, though some may find it a little too extracurricular to the suspense of the main plot. The villain is good and evil, and I would have liked to have seen more of that, which is where my extra point disappeared. It would have given the story an extra kick to the suspense, which it needed, because a lot of the suspense was how husbands and other chaps would react to such aggressive role-breaking. It's a tiny criticism. This is truly a wonderful show. If you love excellent period piece BBC crime drama, then you are in for a treat when you discover The Bletchley Circle.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Sluškinjina priča</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Serija prati ženu prisiljenu živjeti kao konkubina pod fundamentalističkom teokratskom diktaturom u bliskoj budućnosti u totalitarnom Gileadu, gdje ženska prava u osnovi ne postoje. Adaptacija klasičnog romana Margaret Atwood, "Sluškinjina priča" govori o životu u distopiji Gileada, totalitarnog društva u nekadašnjim Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama. Suočeni s ekološkom katastrofom i oštrim padom nataliteta, Gileadom vlada izopačeni fundamentalizam u svom militariziranom "povratku tradicionalnim vrijednostima". Kao jedna od rijetkih preostalih plodnih žena, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) je Sluškinja u Zapovjednikovu kućanstvu, jedna iz kaste žena prisiljenih na seksualno ropstvo u posljednjem očajničkom pokušaju da se svijet ponovno napuči. Emmyjem nagrađena dramska serija vraća se s drugom sezonom koja se vrti oko Offredine trudnoće i njezine trajne borbe da oslobodi svoje buduće dijete iz distopijskih užasa Gileada. "Gilead je u tebi", omiljena je uzrečica tete Lydije. U drugoj sezoni Offred i svi naši likovi borit će se protiv ove mračne istine - ili joj podleći.</desc>

I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.\n\nChristian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.\n\nTom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead "enforcer", but one of the criminal masterminds behind "Gotham's Reckoning", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.\n\nAnne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.\n\nMarion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.\n\nThe unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.\n\nSpecial mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role. \n\nIf you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary. \n\nI suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.\n\nFrom here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios?

Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.\n\nReturn of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson.

It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get.

    <title lang="hr">Sluškinjina priča</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Serija prati ženu prisiljenu živjeti kao konkubina pod fundamentalističkom teokratskom diktaturom u bliskoj budućnosti u totalitarnom Gileadu, gdje ženska prava u osnovi ne postoje. Adaptacija klasičnog romana Margaret Atwood, "Sluškinjina priča" govori o životu u distopiji Gileada, totalitarnog društva u nekadašnjim Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama. Suočeni s ekološkom katastrofom i oštrim padom nataliteta, Gileadom vlada izopačeni fundamentalizam u svom militariziranom "povratku tradicionalnim vrijednostima". Kao jedna od rijetkih preostalih plodnih žena, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) je Sluškinja u Zapovjednikovu kućanstvu, jedna iz kaste žena prisiljenih na seksualno ropstvo u posljednjem očajničkom pokušaju da se svijet ponovno napuči. Emmyjem nagrađena dramska serija vraća se s drugom sezonom koja se vrti oko Offredine trudnoće i njezine trajne borbe da oslobodi svoje buduće dijete iz distopijskih užasa Gileada. "Gilead je u tebi", omiljena je uzrečica tete Lydije. U drugoj sezoni Offred i svi naši likovi borit će se protiv ove mračne istine - ili joj podleći.</desc>

Dok se Robin bori s promjenama u privatnom životu, ona i Strike uspijevaju pružiti utjehu ožalošćenom ocu. Par intervjuira još ključnih aktera u slučaju i tijesno surađuje s policijom, i dalje se primičući ucjenjivačevu neuhvatljivom suučesniku. Nakon što njihov odlazak na imanje gotovo završi katastrofom, Robin napokon podijeli svoje osobne probleme sa Strikeom te se njih dvoje sada bolje razumiju.

While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.\n\nIn the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.\n\nThe Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films. By the time we got to the last few Harry Potter movies, we weren't exactly looking for a brisk narrative. And I was hoping for this in Fantastic Beasts--albeit, probably unrealistically.\n\nSet in 1926, an English wizard, Newt (Eddie Redmayne), comes to America for McGuffin-like reasons (and unclear, at that). He gets into some trouble as some of the fantastic beasts escape from the suitcase where he's keeping them. As this is happening, he gets mixed in with a normal non-magical human, Jacob (Dan Fogler).\n\nOther assorted things happen that are appealing to the audience. We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.\n\nThis is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.\n\nYou will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the ingress back into the beloved world of Harry Potter.And Easter eggs are scattered all around. Just don't go into it with the same expectations as its predecessors.\n\nTwizard Rating: 93","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":420387,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Dok se Robin bori s promjenama u privatnom životu, ona i Strike uspijevaju pružiti utjehu ožalošćenom ocu. Par intervjuira još ključnih aktera u slučaju i tijesno surađuje s policijom, i dalje se primičući ucjenjivačevu neuhvatljivom suučesniku. Nakon što njihov odlazak na imanje gotovo završi katastrofom, Robin napokon podijeli svoje osobne probleme sa Strikeom te se njih dvoje sada bolje razumiju. Dok policija uhićuje osumnjičenika, kockice se napokon poslože za Strikea - no dok njegova partnerica nesvjesno ulazi u opasnost, rješenje slučaja možda za Robin stigne prekasno.</desc>

I admittedly probably shouldn't have started with any of the Craig films, as it's harder to appreciate the older ones if you do. The older ones are a lot of fun, but they're more slowly paced, and the action sequences aren't as plentiful, or as advanced, by today's standards. But for the 60s and 70s, they were ahead of their time, and they're still a ton of fun for me, regardless of how well they hold up.\n\n"Dr. No" is the first film in the franchise, released in 1962. It's the first film in the franchise, but it's based on the 6th book in the franchise (written by Ian Fleming), and one which received a lot of criticism as well. I haven't read the book, although I have read several Bond novels, but from what I've read review-wise, the film seems to mostly stick to the source material.\n\nThe plot: James Bond, agent 007 of the British secret service, is sent to find out what happened to a missing fellow agent, and the trail leads him to Jamaica, where he tangles with Dr. No, an evil scientist bent on disrupting an American space launch.\n\nThe story itself is interesting, though it probably could've moved along a little more quickly, but I did appreciate how much time was taken to really develop the story. That is an aspect of the earlier Bonds that's really nice, is how much story and layers of complexity there were to the plots, at least, the first few Connery films. The script was written by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather. Richard Maibaum became a veteran writer for the Bond films, doing the scripts for the majority of the earlier ones, and he really is gifted. This film, and the others, are very well thought out and imaginative, and Maibaum and the others adapt the original book well for the screen. The plot does seem to stall at times, but overall there's a lot of plot that builds, and makes the climax more anticipated. This film came before the "Bond Formula" was fully realized, and all the nuances of it aren't present here, but this is definitely where it started.\n\nTerence Young had an excellent directorial showing here, capably and effectively handling the action scenes and the character development. His style was very influential on future films in the series, and he is definitely one of, if not the, best directors to handle a James Bond film.\n\nThere are a few action sequences in this film, though, if you're an action junkie this might not be for you. The action comes only when necessary, and only as a device to move the plot along. Unlike many of the later Bond films, there aren't any overblown, extended scenes, and much of the action happens quickly. There's a brief fight scene between Bond and an assassin, the metal dragon scene on the beach, and the final fight scene. In between are a few short moments, and the movie is surprisingly violent for a film in 1962. Bond kills a man with a knife offscreen, a man is set on fire and dies, Bond shoots a man several times in cold blood (which became one of the most infamous and memorable kills in the series), etc. The violence isn't shocking by today's standards, but I was surprised at some of the blood and brutality present for the time, but the Bond films again were very ahead of their time in terms of action and violence, and the violence portrayed here still doesn't quite reach the levels of gritty and at times graphic violence seen in Ian Fleming's novels.\n\nThe film was even dismissed at the time by a lot of critics due to the violence, because as I said, the film was ahead of its time. The Vatican even took shots at the film, saying it was "a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex", which probably isn't inaccurate, though this film is nowhere near as close to that template as some of the newer Bond films (the 1962 Vatican reviewer would've had a heart attack had he seen any of the Craig or Brosnan films). The film's reception at the time was generally mixed, but over time, it's been reappraised as one of the series' best entries, which is also accurate.\n\nMany Bond tropes were instituted here, including, the diabolical villain with overblown plans, and the gorgeous female sidekick, known colloquially as "Bond girls". In this case, they are Dr. No, who is a very memorable villain, equal parts stoic and sadistic. He is cold and calculating, and he is brutal, either following through, or at least attempting, to torture Bond and his companion on different occasions. It's especially interesting how much of an impact he had on the Bond films and the action/spy genre in general, especially since he doesn't even appear in the film until about 2/3 of the way through. The girl is Honey Rider, one of the most memorable Bond girls, and probably one of the most developed, and she too doesn't appear until closer to the film's climax. Other institutions here are the villain's large base with many jump suit-clad henchmen, and the opening song and the iconic gun barrel opening, both very creative, which are just more testaments to how ahead of its time this film was. Oh, and "Bond, James Bond", one of the greatest film lines ever.\n\nSean Connery did very well, and he really is a great Bond. I've seen all the films by now and am still trying to decide my personal ranking of the actors, but it's pointless to get caught up in that debate. Regardless of his successors, Connery is still great, and put his stamp on the character here. He was the first, he made the character his own, and he gave a great performance. Ursula Andress was pretty good, though apparently Nikki van der Zyl did her lines, and she just mouthed them, I don't know why. Joseph Wiseman did an excellent job as Dr. No, and created a really iconic villain, and his cold glares and short lines were delivered well.\n\nThe character of James Bond here is very interesting, and really embodies the character imagined in Fleming's novels, equal parts cultured gentleman and badass trained killer. He is lighthearted and sardonic at times, and cold and ruthless at others, and Connery managed to balance these well, giving the character a subtle nuance. Three Bond regulars first appear here as well. The first is Q, called Mr Boothroyd here (played by Peter Burton), who supplies 007 with all of his gadgets and toys. The others are M (played by Bernard Lee), Bond's no nonsense superior, and Mrs. Moneypenny (played by Lois Maxwell), M's flirtatious and interesting secretary.\n\nOverall, I thought it was great, and it did go on to spawn a 25 (26 if you count "Never Say Never Again") film series, all of which are entertaining. This was a fun movie, slow at times, and it's also pretty dated by today's standards, but that doesn't take away from how innovative and entertaining it is. I am a huge Bond fan, and I highly recommend this movie to fans, and if you're not a fan, you should still check it out. It's an essential piece of pop culture and film history, and well worth your time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153272,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I admittedly probably shouldn't have started with any of the Craig films, as it's harder to appreciate the older ones if you do. The older ones are a lot of fun, but they're more slowly paced, and the action sequences aren't as plentiful, or as advanced, by today's standards. But for the 60s and 70s, they were ahead of their time, and they're still a ton of fun for me, regardless of how well they hold up.\n\n"Dr. No" is the first film in the franchise, released in 1962. It's the first film in the franchise, but it's based on the 6th book in the franchise (written by Ian Fleming), and one which received a lot of criticism as well. I haven't read the book, although I have read several Bond novels, but from what I've read review-wise, the film seems to mostly stick to the source material.\n\nThe plot: James Bond, agent 007 of the British secret service, is sent to find out what happened to a missing fellow agent, and the trail leads him to Jamaica, where he tangles with Dr. No, an evil scientist bent on disrupting an American space launch.\n\nThe story itself is interesting, though it probably could've moved along a little more quickly, but I did appreciate how much time was taken to really develop the story. That is an aspect of the earlier Bonds that's really nice, is how much story and layers of complexity there were to the plots, at least, the first few Connery films. The script was written by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather. Richard Maibaum became a veteran writer for the Bond films, doing the scripts for the majority of the earlier ones, and he really is gifted. This film, and the others, are very well thought out and imaginative, and Maibaum and the others adapt the original book well for the screen. The plot does seem to stall at times, but overall there's a lot of plot that builds, and makes the climax more anticipated. This film came before the "Bond Formula" was fully realized, and all the nuances of it aren't present here, but this is definitely where it started.\n\nTerence Young had an excellent directorial showing here, capably and effectively handling the action scenes and the character development. His style was very influential on future films in the series, and he is definitely one of, if not the, best directors to handle a James Bond film.\n\nThere are a few action sequences in this film, though, if you're an action junkie this might not be for you. The action comes only when necessary, and only as a device to move the plot along. Unlike many of the later Bond films, there aren't any overblown, extended scenes, and much of the action happens quickly. There's a brief fight scene between Bond and an assassin, the metal dragon scene on the beach, and the final fight scene. In between are a few short moments, and the movie is surprisingly violent for a film in 1962. Bond kills a man with a knife offscreen, a man is set on fire and dies, Bond shoots a man several times in cold blood (which became one of the most infamous and memorable kills in the series), etc. The violence isn't shocking by today's standards, but I was surprised at some of the blood and brutality present for the time, but the Bond films again were very ahead of their time in terms of action and violence, and the violence portrayed here still doesn't quite reach the levels of gritty and at times graphic violence seen in Ian Fleming's novels.\n\nThe film was even dismissed at the time by a lot of critics due to the violence, because as I said, the film was ahead of its time. The Vatican even took shots at the film, saying it was "a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex", which probably isn't inaccurate, though this film is nowhere near as close to that template as some of the newer Bond films (the 1962 Vatican reviewer would've had a heart attack had he seen any of the Craig or Brosnan films). The film's reception at the time was generally mixed, but over time, it's been reappraised as one of the series' best entries, which is also accurate.\n\nMany Bond tropes were instituted here, including, the diabolical villain with overblown plans, and the gorgeous female sidekick, known colloquially as "Bond girls". In this case, they are Dr. No, who is a very memorable villain, equal parts stoic and sadistic. He is cold and calculating, and he is brutal, either following through, or at least attempting, to torture Bond and his companion on different occasions. It's especially interesting how much of an impact he had on the Bond films and the action/spy genre in general, especially since he doesn't even appear in the film until about 2/3 of the way through. The girl is Honey Rider, one of the most memorable Bond girls, and probably one of the most developed, and she too doesn't appear until closer to the film's climax. Other institutions here are the villain's large base with many jump suit-clad henchmen, and the opening song and the iconic gun barrel opening, both very creative, which are just more testaments to how ahead of its time this film was. Oh, and "Bond, James Bond", one of the greatest film lines ever.\n\nSean Connery did very well, and he really is a great Bond. I've seen all the films by now and am still trying to decide my personal ranking of the actors, but it's pointless to get caught up in that debate. Regardless of his successors, Connery is still great, and put his stamp on the character here. He was the first, he made the character his own, and he gave a great performance. Ursula Andress was pretty good, though apparently Nikki van der Zyl did her lines, and she just mouthed them, I don't know why. Joseph Wiseman did an excellent job as Dr. No, and created a really iconic villain, and his cold glares and short lines were delivered well.\n\nThe character of James Bond here is very interesting, and really embodies the character imagined in Fleming's novels, equal parts cultured gentleman and badass trained killer. He is lighthearted and sardonic at times, and cold and ruthless at others, and Connery managed to balance these well, giving the character a subtle nuance. Three Bond regulars first appear here as well. The first is Q, called Mr Boothroyd here (played by Peter Burton), who supplies 007 with all of his gadgets and toys. The others are M (played by Bernard Lee), Bond's no nonsense superior, and Mrs. Moneypenny (played by Lois Maxwell), M's flirtatious and interesting secretary.\n\nOverall, I thought it was great, and it did go on to spawn a 25 (26 if you count "Never Say Never Again") film series, all of which are entertaining. This was a fun movie, slow at times, and it's also pretty dated by today's standards, but that doesn't take away from how innovative and entertaining it is. I am a huge Bond fan, and I highly recommend this movie to fans, and if you're not a fan, you should still check it out. It's an essential piece of pop culture and film history, and well worth your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153272,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.\n\nAs I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.\n\nThis movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.\n\nThis film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.\n\nEven though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.\n\nMy Grade: A-","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":302126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton.

Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, Vicky's scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the "regents" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet, when William does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First, she must surround herself with the "right" advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision.

Friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including Broadbent, Richardson, Bettany, Strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest. Also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit.

We've had almost every conceivable approach, from straight-up documentary through imagined version of events as well as completely invented bands, singers, songs, and concerts. Yet, I don't think that anyone has ever managed to do what the Coen Brothers have produced with this tragic, comedic, touching piece.\n\nWhich is to essentially transport you into the grooves of an LP, Inside Llewyn Davies, and bring you a beautifully realised portrayal of the eponymous hero as he trudges his weary way through the greys and greens of Greenwich Village in a cold New York. And it is so reminiscent of the experience of listening to your favourite vinyl album from track one, side one to the final track of side two, whilst curling up on the couch with a cat in your lap, listening to a selection of melodic, melancholic, traditional, and new folk music.\n\nThe music binds this movie together and Oscar Issac inhabits the title role in a world-weary way that aches with ennui and longs for something never expressed. We follow his tramping travails through a range of vignettes that build subtly towards creating a quite compelling picture of the man behind the music. He sometimes does what we expect and at other junctures, veers off in a mad new direction. There is little explanation for any of the decisions that he does, or doesn't, take. He's searching without any clear idea of the quest.\n\nAlong the way, we meet a wonderfully diverse bunch of supporting characters, from the biting Jean, acerbic tongue and acid looks, through the snoring bully Roland Turner and his valet Johnny Five, as well as Mitch and Lilian, the Upper West posh couple, but especially Ulysses, our hero's apparent companion over the week (or was s/he?). They all offer opportunities to understand Davies' psyche slightly more, albeit admitting that not even he appears to be fully cognisant himself.\n\nIt's a lovely looking film, beautifully shot and much more enjoyable that I would have believed possible from watching the trailer previously. T Bone Burnett has done a sterling job on the soundtrack, it's so affecting and the way that the songs are all allowed to play out saw the audience in the cinema in which I saw this mainly remaining seated through the end credits as well. Which brings me back to the vinyl album sensation. You don't pick up the needle when your favorite record is playing the final track, because you want to get on with something else instead. No. You let it run right to the end of the groove and then your heart fills with an equal mixture of pleasure and joy, sorrow and sighs, as the last bars fade to quiet and all that's gone before becomes a memory that's so strong and so addictive that you want to turn it over and put the needle back into the groove all over again.\n\nThis movie is precisely like that sensation and I loved it, from first frame to last. A quiet understated tragi-comedy, dark in places, and shadowy in others, but with a humanity and a compassion that you cannot avert our gaze from. Hell, it's even got a coda of a scene to be dealing with, which at the end takes your mind back to the start of the production and forces one to reexamine what has just passed before your eyes.

(Dir: Harold Ramis) The old adage: `Be careful what you wish for, For you might receive it' clearly applies to this remake of the 1967 cult Brit classic starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in this updated farce of the old `Faust' legend, but this time with a formidable lead actor and a director of fine comedic pedigree. The former being Fraser cast as a hopeless schlub named Elliot who works as a computer techie in a San Francisco conglomerate where he is disdained by his fellow employees as his self-deluded friends and is equally hapless in love with another co-worker (well let's be frank, some babe who also works in the skyscraper that he spoke to once 4 years ago).  Obviously inept at the social graces he makes a boob of himself one night at the local watering hole summoning up the gumption to speak to the fair Alison (O'Connor) with only a tight smile of constrained indifference and when he looks to his friends for a moment, she simply leaves him in his wake walking out of the bar. Speaking to himself and wishing to do anything to have the lady of his dreams fall madly for him sets up the chain of events involving the Devil in A Red Dress (the sultry Hurley having some fun here) to proposition the dorky Elliot into selling his soul to Her for 7 wishes/chances in gaining Alison to be his. The set ups are uneven at best but humorous thanks largely to the always game and amiable Fraser who has a finely tuned comedic grace and delves into his seven incarnations with gusto. Hurley, who is no doubt about it devilishly hot in her many form fitting costumes of debauchery, fumbles a bit here and there but she drips sexuality that sadly the pretty O' Connor fails to elicit for her character (it's vexing to have the fantasy girl of the protagonist's desires to be standard when you have the bodacious Hurley as Satan Herself, popping out of her barely-there outfits). The second part of what makes the re-shaping of the farce is Ramis (who co-wrote the screenplay with his longtime creative partner Peter Tolan and icon scribe Larry Gelbart, who's career encompasses everything from The Golden Age of Television Comedy with Sid Caesar to `Tootsie' and tv's `M*A*S*H' not to mention the 180 equivalent of this flick, `Oh, God!' with George Burns as The Almighty) whose sublime, low-key approach allows the one-liners and slapstick congeal into one substantial mold whereby the characters you care about and the humor rings a beat after it delivers.  That is the signature of a true master of the genre but sad to say it isn't consistent throughout and equally troubling is that you can almost see where each variation of Elliot is heading (and largely you don't sense any true menace from the seemingly harmless Hurley - well at least until there is one knee-knocking moment where she's a giantess in a flame-red bikini top clearly getting to the point of not fooling with Ol' Scratch; oh baby!) The loophole laden premise is amusing to watch unspool on the two-steps behind Elliot but the journey itself becomes tiring and that is what makes this naughty comedy two steps behind being hellaciously hilarious."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are moments of farce, slapstick, and outrageous humor, surrounded by moments where things just happen.

The are both turning 40, and neither is handling it particularly gracefully, but they weren't handling their lives and relationships particularly well in the earlier film. I found this movie to have a Larry David Show quality to it: however irrationally and offensively our protagonists behave, there are always others who will go them one better (or worse).

There are moments of farce, slapstick, and outrageous humor, surrounded by moments where things just happen. For people who can't handle that kind of pacing, you are welcome to stay out of movie theaters, and sit in front of your TV sets: the networks are sure to have plenty of non-challenging sitcoms that are specially designed to pander to you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131180,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

An Officer and a Gentleman  is a classic tale of overcoming yourself, beating the odds, friendship and the all amercian love story. The film which to this day Taylor Hackford has never topped gets great performances out of all it's actors especially Gere and Debra Winger as the two love birds in love and the odds they over come to be together. The film doesn't make training look unrealstic or promosing and of course there's going to be errors in the film's deception of the miltray but what film about the miltray has been perfect through out ? What makes An Officer and a Gentleman  work for me is the performances and we all know that even though Gere and Winger give great performances the film belongs to Louis Gosset Jr who won a well deserved Oscar for his role as Foley. The difference between Gosset and R. Lee Emery in Full Metal Jacket is Emery was a former gunnery sergerant in the Marines and Gosset never had milatry experince to my knowledge which makes the film all the more enjoyable. Throw in some comedy, a few fight scenes and some sex scenes and you have a great crowd pleasing film that anyone can enjoy. I give the film **** stars."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51191,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film which to this day Taylor Hackford has never topped gets great performances out of all it's actors especially Gere and Debra Winger as the two love birds in love and the odds they over come to be together. The film doesn't make training look unrealstic or promosing and of course there's going to be errors in the film's deception of the miltray but what film about the miltray has been perfect through out ? What makes An Officer and a Gentleman  work for me is the performances and we all know that even though Gere and Winger give great performances the film belongs to Louis Gosset Jr who won a well deserved Oscar for his role as Foley. The difference between Gosset and R. Lee Emery in Full Metal Jacket is Emery was a former gunnery sergerant in the Marines and Gosset never had milatry experince to my knowledge which makes the film all the more enjoyable. Throw in some comedy, a few fight scenes and some sex scenes and you have a great crowd pleasing film that anyone can enjoy. I give the film **** stars.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51191,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What makes An Officer and a Gentleman  work for me is the performances and we all know that even though Gere and Winger give great performances the film belongs to Louis Gosset Jr who won a well deserved Oscar for his role as Foley. The difference between Gosset and R. Lee Emery in Full Metal Jacket is Emery was a former gunnery sergerant in the Marines and Gosset never had milatry experince to my knowledge which makes the film all the more enjoyable. Throw in some comedy, a few fight scenes and some sex scenes and you have a great crowd pleasing film that anyone can enjoy. I give the film **** stars.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51191,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Night Shyamalan's SIGNS\n\nRated: PG (Canada), PG-13 (U.S.)\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Kulkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones and M Night Shayamalan\n\n"Daddy there's a monster beside my bed, can I have a glass of water?"\n\nWhen Graham (Mel Gibson) and Merill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix) discover 50 ft circle and square shapes carved in their crops, the two try and find out the truth behind what is going on. However, what Graham learns soon is that the battle he will soon be facing is not that of extra terrestrial beings but that within his own self.\n\nIn facing a universal theme of life on other planets, Shyamalan's handling is different from your ordinary type of supernatural movie. This is because the underlying theme of this movie is not aliens, but in fact, it is faith. Faith in something larger, faith of miracles, faith that nothing in this life is coincidental and everything happens for a reason. The theme of this movie is not survival of outer forces rather than survival of internal and seemingly more powerful than what is even happening outside.\n\nThere is not a single movie that is out there which scares the viewer on a level of things they are NOT seeing rather than what they do see. It does not deserve to be classified in any category because this film is in a league of its own. The base of supernatural and extra terrestrial beings in this case forms the base for human self exploration and finding who they truly are.\n\nPERFORMANCES\n\nIn all sequences, Shyamalan concentrates on character development and even from the first scene, we seemingly have a look into the world of a man, who is emotionally wounded, and yet silent and powerful. Shyamalan has gone with Mel Gibson to play the title role, which some fans of M. Night would have rather gone with Bruce Willis who has played the quiter type role in Sixth Sense and even starred in Shyamalan's "Unbreakable". However, from the very first frame, you can see that Gibson becomes the role and lives through the role. In terms of his performance, the transformation he goes through the entire frame of the movie really is a true testament to the powerful skill that this actor embodies. In many scenes, his eyes do the talking, and it takes a powerful director to really capitalize on what Gibson does in this type of role.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, playing Graham's brother Merill, is a powerful support in the movie. His character gains a lot of sympathy. Even as he is trying to find his place in the world, his support for his family is unwavering, making this role one of the most sympathetic and yet powerful roles the talented actor has ever faced.\n\nOnce again, Shyamalan gets unbelievably powerful performances from his child artistes in this movie. Rory Culkin, playing Graham's son in the movie, as well as Abigial Breslin, give such emotion filled performances that it really surprises us that Shyamalan can extract performances of this calibre from them.\n\nEven Cherry Jones, who plays the local police officer, puts in a realistic and heartfelt performance as the local police officer in Graham's community.\n\n Finally, Shyamalan himself makes a mark in the film. His role is an essential one and yet does not require many scenes. Shyamalan pulls them off with full ease and power.\n\nDIRECTION/SCREENPLAY\n\nIf you try and compare "Signs" to any previous movies you may be able to find some ground from this movie in Shyamalan's first movie, "The Sixth Sense". However, in terms of comparisons, this is where they end. Shyamalan knows how to create and move in terms of environment, which is very important for all his movies. Shyamalan's direction is powerful and really gets under the skin of the characters.\n\nBeing a thriller, Shyamalan has used an older technique, where he uses comedy to offset a particular mood, even in the gravest of scenes. Shyamalan pulls this off extremely well, even as the screenplay pulls into frightening moments. It takes a brilliant filmmaker to do something like this even when the mood of the scene is totally contrasting to that of what the audience is experiencing.\n\nIts something refreshing to see a brand new director like Shyamalan using the rules of filmmaking that have been forgotten by many of the newer filmmakers these days into making something so powerful and so refreshingly different for the summer. While many new filmmakers base their movies on subjects that really don't take any risks, Shyamalan has made a seemingly new genre, one of self exploration and discovery while in the face of fear or adversity. There is no other film like this one, as it takes two genres and really powers itself into making a seemingly hard hitting combination.\n\n Even the title of the film has a meaning, as the signs are everywhere. There are subtle and hidden messages everywhere, from the scene where Merill is in the Army office and the Recruiter is speaking, or the flashback sequences which Mel Gibson has of a particular incident in his life.\n\n OVERALL EFFECT\n\nThis film is unlike any other film to have ever come out in the genre of supernatural thriller or drama. Its something that lets you leave the cinema thinking truly that in this life there are no coincidences and things happen for a reason. As Gibson said in the film, there are two kinds of people. There are those who believe that everything happens for a reason and that we are not alone; and there are those who believe that we live in metaphysical solitude. There are people with faith and without it. He now has to figure out which group he belongs to, and so he does in the chilling climax.\n\n The film is one of the most powerful pieces of cinema I have witnessed and simply put is a much watch.\n\nRating: 10 out of 10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":342495,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Night Shyamalan's SIGNS\n\nRated: PG (Canada), PG-13 (U.S.)\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Kulkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones and M Night Shayamalan\n\n"Daddy there's a monster beside my bed, can I have a glass of water?"\n\nWhen Graham (Mel Gibson) and Merill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix) discover 50 ft circle and square shapes carved in their crops, the two try and find out the truth behind what is going on. However, what Graham learns soon is that the battle he will soon be facing is not that of extra terrestrial beings but that within his own self.\n\nIn facing a universal theme of life on other planets, Shyamalan's handling is different from your ordinary type of supernatural movie. This is because the underlying theme of this movie is not aliens, but in fact, it is faith. Faith in something larger, faith of miracles, faith that nothing in this life is coincidental and everything happens for a reason. The theme of this movie is not survival of outer forces rather than survival of internal and seemingly more powerful than what is even happening outside.\n\nThere is not a single movie that is out there which scares the viewer on a level of things they are NOT seeing rather than what they do see.

Mario misses his mate Laura Fuentes (Cecilia Narova), who has recently left him, and is recovering from a car crash with an injured leg. When the major investor Angelo Larroca (Juan Luis Galiardo) asks for an audition for his lover Elena Flores (Mía Maestro), she succeeds and participates in the play; however, Mario falls in love for her and Elena fears the dangerous Angelo.\n\nI saw "Tango" for the first time on 01 January 2001; I have just watched it again and I still believe it is one of the most wonderful tributes to the tango. Carlos Saura uses the concept that history is indestructible and recalls the dark years of military dictatorship in Argentina after the amnesty entwined with a passionate love of a middle-aged man for a young woman to build the plot, supported by stunning cast, choreography, music score and lighting. However, the conclusion is confused and disappointing, and I really do not understand the relationship of Angelo and Mario acting like pals in the last scene. Cecilia Narova and Mía Maestro are extremely beautiful and fantastic dancers, and I do not get tired of seeing them dancing tango. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Tango"","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2807,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Mario misses his mate Laura Fuentes (Cecilia Narova), who has recently left him, and is recovering from a car crash with an injured leg. When the major investor Angelo Larroca (Juan Luis Galiardo) asks for an audition for his lover Elena Flores (Mía Maestro), she succeeds and participates in the play; however, Mario falls in love for her and Elena fears the dangerous Angelo.\n\nI saw "Tango" for the first time on 01 January 2001; I have just watched it again and I still believe it is one of the most wonderful tributes to the tango. Carlos Saura uses the concept that history is indestructible and recalls the dark years of military dictatorship in Argentina after the amnesty entwined with a passionate love of a middle-aged man for a young woman to build the plot, supported by stunning cast, choreography, music score and lighting. However, the conclusion is confused and disappointing, and I really do not understand the relationship of Angelo and Mario acting like pals in the last scene. Cecilia Narova and Mía Maestro are extremely beautiful and fantastic dancers, and I do not get tired of seeing them dancing tango. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Tango"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2807,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The character is caught like a bird flapping around a cage and can't get out of the film's stoic vision.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13105,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As we see popularity with such shows as "The Office" or the most recent "Life on Mars", we seem to be gobbling up popular programs from across the pond at the speed of light, and oddly more and more seem to feel less authentic. Sure, the actual conversations and dynamic dilemmas that occur each episode my be home-grown, but the idea  it is the original idea that should be coveted. It would be equal to saying that you love DSL without ever experiencing dial-up  how can you compare? Recently, I was able to scrounge around and discover a VHS that may, upon first viewing, seem like a hodgepodge of police interferences within the confines of Paris, but look deeper. Does our heroine, a tough, never by the book-paper pushing detective whom isn't afraid to corrupt the system to get results, a cop who isn't afraid to have a wife, but also a prostitute informant on the side? Wouldn't you agree that perhaps I am explaining the life of Vic Mackey from "The Shield"? Yet, I am not  I am talking about Lulu, our Parisian officer in the outstanding "L.627".\n\nLost within the conversion from VHS to DVD, this obscure title has not seen the light of day for a long time; in fact, you could probably find this at a yard sale for less than a dollar. If this is ever the case, pick it up and buy it  it is worth viewing at least once to demonstrate the raw grittiness of police work. It has never been a colorful position, despite the humorous depiction in "Police Academy", and director Bertrand Tavernier knows how to push the envelope to such an extent that our fictional officer's cause affects the reason. They want drug off the streets, Lulu is constantly pushing his girlfriend to stop using drugs, but the means are not readily available. With broken police vehicles, pranksters instead of officers, lacking budget with technology, Lulu and Company are forced to take measures into their own hands. They fight crime, perhaps not the way the officer handbook suggests, but they fight crime. One scene that specifically stands out is one where Lulu is about to bust a dealer/supplier in a nearby park, he uses a nearby school to ensure that they are able to see the transaction take place. They are able to find an empty room, but the principal doesn't want them in the school  contradictory to the ideals that schools want drugs off the street. There was this sense of animosity between person and officer  as if the principal didn't believe that our officers would actually do anything of value. This was a small, yet shocking scene that defines Tavernier's central theme.\n\nDoes Lulu get the drugs off the streets? Does he finally get the funding that he wants? Does his personally life collide with his cop life? These are all questions that Tavernier answers with small, seemingly insignificant scenes. There is a perfect ending scene that resonates within my mind between Lulu and his prostitute sideline. It demonstrates the quality of Lulu's work, and summarizes this film in a small 10-minute scene. That seems to be Tavernier's trademark with this film. A full range of quality small scenes that tie our characters together. Individually, this is a rather bland film  difficult to begin and even longer to finish with nearly 2 ½ hours of play time, but intertwined, these scenes speak about the Parisian police force. "L.627" is a film that resonates within the mind. Oddly, I recently finished watching "La Haine" for the first time, and could argue that this is Tavernier's counter-discussion. Here, he shows why there may be police racism, why the law uses brutality, and why frustration between officers reigns supreme. Kassovitz's film gives us the counter-point, the view from the poverty on the streets.\n\nOverall, does "L.627" demand repeat viewing? Is it wronged not to have a DVD release? These are all important questions, but the answer is not readily available. "L.627" demonstrates powerful acting, documentary-esquire camera work, and a chilling theme, but the honesty lies within Tavernier's storytelling. While Lulu is our central character, this isn't a story about him. We don't have an emotional roller-coaster of a film where our hero redeems himself at the end. This isn't a Hollywood movie. In "L.627" social commentary is king, and we, as outsiders looking in, must just absorb the honest nature of the film. It is a tale of good corruption, hard working individuals, and the hardships of control.

 --- Description: L.627: Directed by Bertrand Tavernier. With Didier Bezace, Jean-Paul Comart, Charlotte Kady, Jean-Roger Milo. This gritty police drama shows us the underbelly of the Parisian drug trade. Lulu is a tough streetwise narcotics cop who, like a Frank Serpico or a Dirty Harry Callahan, doesn't play by the rules or kowtow to his weak and/or corrupt superiors. Lulu thrives in this violent world, where sheer guts can overcome his squad's deficiencies of money and equipment.

As we see popularity with such shows as "The Office" or the most recent "Life on Mars", we seem to be gobbling up popular programs from across the pond at the speed of light, and oddly more and more seem to feel less authentic. Sure, the actual conversations and dynamic dilemmas that occur each episode my be home-grown, but the idea  it is the original idea that should be coveted. It would be equal to saying that you love DSL without ever experiencing dial-up  how can you compare? Recently, I was able to scrounge around and discover a VHS that may, upon first viewing, seem like a hodgepodge of police interferences within the confines of Paris, but look deeper. Does our heroine, a tough, never by the book-paper pushing detective whom isn't afraid to corrupt the system to get results, a cop who isn't afraid to have a wife, but also a prostitute informant on the side? Wouldn't you agree that perhaps I am explaining the life of Vic Mackey from "The Shield"? Yet, I am not  I am talking about Lulu, our Parisian officer in the outstanding "L.627".\n\nLost within the conversion from VHS to DVD, this obscure title has not seen the light of day for a long time; in fact, you could probably find this at a yard sale for less than a dollar. If this is ever the case, pick it up and buy it  it is worth viewing at least once to demonstrate the raw grittiness of police work. It has never been a colorful position, despite the humorous depiction in "Police Academy", and director Bertrand Tavernier knows how to push the envelope to such an extent that our fictional officer's cause affects the reason. They want drug off the streets, Lulu is constantly pushing his girlfriend to stop using drugs, but the means are not readily available. With broken police vehicles, pranksters instead of officers, lacking budget with technology, Lulu and Company are forced to take measures into their own hands. They fight crime, perhaps not the way the officer handbook suggests, but they fight crime. One scene that specifically stands out is one where Lulu is about to bust a dealer/supplier in a nearby park, he uses a nearby school to ensure that they are able to see the transaction take place. They are able to find an empty room, but the principal doesn't want them in the school  contradictory to the ideals that schools want drugs off the street. There was this sense of animosity between person and officer  as if the principal didn't believe that our officers would actually do anything of value. This was a small, yet shocking scene that defines Tavernier's central theme.\n\nDoes Lulu get the drugs off the streets? Does he finally get the funding that he wants? Does his personally life collide with his cop life? These are all questions that Tavernier answers with small, seemingly insignificant scenes. There is a perfect ending scene that resonates within my mind between Lulu and his prostitute sideline. It demonstrates the quality of Lulu's work, and summarizes this film in a small 10-minute scene. That seems to be Tavernier's trademark with this film. A full range of quality small scenes that tie our characters together. Individually, this is a rather bland film  difficult to begin and even longer to finish with nearly 2 ½ hours of play time, but intertwined, these scenes speak about the Parisian police force. "L.627" is a film that resonates within the mind. Oddly, I recently finished watching "La Haine" for the first time, and could argue that this is Tavernier's counter-discussion. Here, he shows why there may be police racism, why the law uses brutality, and why frustration between officers reigns supreme. Kassovitz's film gives us the counter-point, the view from the poverty on the streets.\n\nOverall, does "L.627" demand repeat viewing? Is it wronged not to have a DVD release? These are all important questions, but the answer is not readily available. "L.627" demonstrates powerful acting, documentary-esquire camera work, and a chilling theme, but the honesty lies within Tavernier's storytelling. While Lulu is our central character, this isn't a story about him. We don't have an emotional roller-coaster of a film where our hero redeems himself at the end. This isn't a Hollywood movie. In "L.627" social commentary is king, and we, as outsiders looking in, must just absorb the honest nature of the film. It is a tale of good corruption, hard working individuals, and the hardships of control. This will not be a film for everyone, but those privy enough to catch a viewing of this film will be impressed by every element of this film. From the filming to the unequivocal truths, "L.627" is a film to absorb. I am just sorry that I didn't see this film sooner.\n\nAlways remember, instead of WWVMD? (aka What Would Vic Mackey Do?)  try thinking of WWLD? (aka What Would Lulu Do?).\n\nGrade: **** out of *****","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1811,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT2H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First Brando. Brando is regarded by most movie fans as one of the greatest actors of all time, but people usually only mention a handful of his films - 'A Street Car Named Desire', 'On The Waterfront', 'The Godfather', 'Last Tango In Paris' and 'Apocalypse Now'. Without a doubt they are all fine movies but what about his equally worthy performances in his lesser known films (e.g. 'One-Eyed Jacks', and 'Burn!')? Secondly, Arthur Penn. An extremely underrated director in my opinion, especially for his almost forgotten 'Mickey One' and 'Night Moves'. Thirdly, the first rate supporting cast which includes Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, E.G. Marshall, James Fox, Jane Fonda, Angie Dickinson and Clifton James. Apparently there were lots of behind the scenes problems with this movie, but despite a few flaws it's definitely worth watching. The sexual and racial themes were pretty daring for the mid-60s, and while I can see what some people are saying about its "soap" feel, it's quite compelling. Brando plays a small town farmer turned sheriff who is despised by many of his contemporaries because they think he is the puppet of the local millionaire Val Rogers (Marshall). Rogers' son Jake (Fox) is having an affair with a local woman (Fonda) who is married to a convict Bubba Reeves (Redford). Bubba escapes from prison and an innocent bystander is killed by his fellow escapee. Bubba initially plans on heading to Mexico, but he desperately returns to his home town for help, not realizing that he is being hunted as a murderer.  News of his escape causes tensions to explode in the town, with catastrophic results for everyone. Brando is terrific throughout, and reason enough to watch this, but Fonda is surprisingly good, Robert Duvall is memorable as a cuckold, and character actor Clifton James ('Cool Hand Luke', 'Live And Let Die', 'The Last Detail') almost steals the movie as a hot headed drunken redneck. 'The Chase' may not be as great as it could have been, but I still think it deserves more attention than it gets. Brando fans shouldn't overlook this one!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10927,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First Brando. Brando is regarded by most movie fans as one of the greatest actors of all time, but people usually only mention a handful of his films - 'A Street Car Named Desire', 'On The Waterfront', 'The Godfather', 'Last Tango In Paris' and 'Apocalypse Now'. Without a doubt they are all fine movies but what about his equally worthy performances in his lesser known films (e.g. 'One-Eyed Jacks', and 'Burn!')? Secondly, Arthur Penn. An extremely underrated director in my opinion, especially for his almost forgotten 'Mickey One' and 'Night Moves'. Thirdly, the first rate supporting cast which includes Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, E.G. Marshall, James Fox, Jane Fonda, Angie Dickinson and Clifton James. Apparently there were lots of behind the scenes problems with this movie, but despite a few flaws it's definitely worth watching. The sexual and racial themes were pretty daring for the mid-60s, and while I can see what some people are saying about its "soap" feel, it's quite compelling. Brando plays a small town farmer turned sheriff who is despised by many of his contemporaries because they think he is the puppet of the local millionaire Val Rogers (Marshall). Rogers' son Jake (Fox) is having an affair with a local woman (Fonda) who is married to a convict Bubba Reeves (Redford). Bubba escapes from prison and an innocent bystander is killed by his fellow escapee. Bubba initially plans on heading to Mexico, but he desperately returns to his home town for help, not realizing that he is being hunted as a murderer.  News of his escape causes tensions to explode in the town, with catastrophic results for everyone. Brando is terrific throughout, and reason enough to watch this, but Fonda is surprisingly good, Robert Duvall is memorable as a cuckold, and character actor Clifton James ('Cool Hand Luke', 'Live And Let Die', 'The Last Detail') almost steals the movie as a hot headed drunken redneck. 'The Chase' may not be as great as it could have been, but I still think it deserves more attention than it gets. Brando fans shouldn't overlook this one!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10927,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Prije političkog angažiranja, malo je bio poznat u narodu, bavio se književnošću i narodnim umotvorinama. Čak ni televizija koja 2015. godine objavljuje rezultate izbora nije imala njegovu sliku. Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu. Umjesto napisanih političkih govora, on je govorio prosto, služeći se izrekama i tako postao vrlo popularan lik, omiljen u narodu. PREMIJER je sitkom serija na temu lica i naličja politike i političara. Junaci PREMIJERA iza viskokih državnih funkcija kriju ljudske mane i vrline, i mi pokušavamo, u neskrivenom nušićevskom maniru, da iznesemo pred gledatelji smiješnu a ponekad i gorku stranu osobnosti onih koji odlučuju o sudbini naroda i zemlje.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je ljubav dvoje mladih, fudbalera Marka Marušića i slikarke Nine Radić. Njihova ljubavna priča je puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče dva su naraštaja triju obitelji povezanih nogometom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz nogomet. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao nogometaši, jedan je postao uspješan trener, a posljednji je u menedžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane. Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovno u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže nogomet i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Usporedno pratimo i živote njihove djece, koji su odrastali pod utjecajem nogometa, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je, dakako, ljubav dvoje mladih, nogometaša Marka Marušića i slikarice Nine Radić. Njihova je ljubavna priča puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu.

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je ljubav dvoje mladih, fudbalera Marka Marušića i slikarke Nine Radić. Njihova ljubavna priča je puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Pare ili život</title>
    <desc lang="hr">"Pare ili život" prati glavne likove iz istoimene serije i njihovu nezaboravnu ljetnju avanturu u najljepšim predelima crnogorskog Primorja. "Pare ili život" je dramska, komična TV serija koja prati nekoliko različitih karaktera u sudaru s našom svakodnevnicom. Dramski realizam ove serije nekad se graniči s apsurdom, ali oslobođen je humora po svaku cenu i radije problematizuje neke socijalne fenomene. U društvu koje priželjkuje da je tranzicija već gotova, a ona tek što je počela, javljaju se brojne zamke za sve one koji se "nisu snašli". A Miki, Džoni, Višnja, Sunčica, Marun, Maja i Časlav, nisu sposobni da u novim okolnostima uspeju poput oca njihovog prijatelja Gagija. Razlozi za to nisu ni vaspitanje, ni "devedesete", ni komunizam (pa toliki zakleti komunisti veoma lako su postali uspešni kapitalisti). Na putu do uspeha smetaju im veliko srce i slab stomak. Svi njihovi poduhvati tužni su do smeha, jer je svako raspet između prevaziđenog osećanja zajedništva i želje za ličnim uspehom. Ipak, kad se u njihovim životima pojavi raspevani sanjar Džoni, počinje da se stvara jedna čudna porodica gde svi oni, hteli to ili ne, ostvaruju mnogo jače veze od onih rodbinskih. I usput dobijaju možda mnogo vredniju nagradu od one za kojom sve vreme jure.</desc>

Prije političkog angažiranja, malo je bio poznat u narodu, bavio se književnošću i narodnim umotvorinama. Čak ni televizija koja 2015. godine objavljuje rezultate izbora nije imala njegovu sliku. Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu. Umjesto napisanih političkih govora, on je govorio prosto, služeći se izrekama i tako postao vrlo popularan lik, omiljen u narodu. PREMIJER je sitkom serija na temu lica i naličja politike i političara. Junaci PREMIJERA iza viskokih državnih funkcija kriju ljudske mane i vrline, i mi pokušavamo, u neskrivenom nušićevskom maniru, da iznesemo pred gledatelji smiješnu a ponekad i gorku stranu osobnosti onih koji odlučuju o sudbini naroda i zemlje.</desc>

Deda mu je rekao da svaki uspešan Srbin mora da ima kafanu i on je ove godine osnovao svoju.

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Prije političkog angažiranja, malo je bio poznat u narodu, bavio se književnošću i narodnim umotvorinama. Čak ni televizija koja 2015. godine objavljuje rezultate izbora nije imala njegovu sliku. Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu. Umjesto napisanih političkih govora, on je govorio prosto, služeći se izrekama i tako postao vrlo popularan lik, omiljen u narodu. PREMIJER je sitkom serija na temu lica i naličja politike i političara. Junaci PREMIJERA iza viskokih državnih funkcija kriju ljudske mane i vrline, i mi pokušavamo, u neskrivenom nušićevskom maniru, da iznesemo pred gledatelji smiješnu a ponekad i gorku stranu osobnosti onih koji odlučuju o sudbini naroda i zemlje.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče dva su naraštaja triju obitelji povezanih nogometom. Dramska serija Ljubav u zaleđu obiteljska je priča čija se radnja odvija u prepoznatljivoj zagrebačkoj urbanoj sredini. U središtu priče dva su naraštaja triju obitelji povezanih nogometom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz nogomet. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao nogometaši, jedan je postao uspješan trener, a posljednji je u menedžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane. Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovno u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže nogomet i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Usporedno pratimo i živote njihove djece, koji su odrastali pod utjecajem nogometa, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je, dakako, ljubav dvoje mladih, nogometaša Marka Marušića i slikarice Nine Radić. Njihova je ljubavna priča puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu.

Prije političkog angažiranja, malo je bio poznat u narodu, bavio se književnošću i narodnim umotvorinama. Čak ni televizija koja 2015. godine objavljuje rezultate izbora nije imala njegovu sliku. Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu. Umjesto napisanih političkih govora, on je govorio prosto, služeći se izrekama i tako postao vrlo popularan lik, omiljen u narodu. PREMIJER je sitkom serija na temu lica i naličja politike i političara. Junaci PREMIJERA iza viskokih državnih funkcija kriju ljudske mane i vrline, i mi pokušavamo, u neskrivenom nušićevskom maniru, da iznesemo pred gledatelji smiješnu a ponekad i gorku stranu osobnosti onih koji odlučuju o sudbini naroda i zemlje.</desc>

Prije političkog angažiranja, malo je bio poznat u narodu, bavio se književnošću i narodnim umotvorinama. Čak ni televizija koja 2015. godine objavljuje rezultate izbora nije imala njegovu sliku. Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu. Umjesto napisanih političkih govora, on je govorio prosto, služeći se izrekama i tako postao vrlo popularan lik, omiljen u narodu. PREMIJER je sitkom serija na temu lica i naličja politike i političara.

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja.

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S.

Hardly","reviewBody":"I'd heard nothing but bad things about The Predator, wall to wall hatred and mockery. It was even suggested that it was one of the worst movies of 2018 and comparable with the messy AVP movies. Going in I was forced to have low expectations, and I firmly disagree.\n\nLet's make something clear, I am not saying The Predator is a good film because it simply isn't but worst of 2018? Absolutely not. It's just a badly flawed addition to the franchise yet manages to be oddly loyal at the same time.\n\nSo a Predator comes to Earth but this time the government is ready for it. Cue lots of action, blood shed but a pretty wafer thin plot that doesn't exactly go anywhere.\n\nWith a stellar cast including Thomas Jane, the stunning Olivia Munn and the excellent Keegan-Michael Key it had no problems on that front. Okay actually I retract that, the leading man Boyd Holbrook is less than impressive and just wasn't up to the task.\n\nWith an odd amount of comedy and levity The Predators tone isn't exactly in keeping with the original movies yet manages to solidly feel like a Predator film thanks to the original score and franchise tropes. I loved the first movie, I thought the second was passable and hated the third but this right here is underwhelming yet perfectly watchable despite the lashings of Hollywoodness it has.\n\nSure it's goofy and badly flawed but I'm not sure exactly what everyone expected. There are certainly a lot of problems with the film, I'd have liked it to be darker, I'd have liked it to be longer and I'd liked the original Predator to have gotten more screentime.\n\nRegardless despite it's many many problems it comes under the category of harmless take your brain out fun.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLoyal score\n\nSome great nods to previous movies\n\nQuite a few very funny moments\n\nDecent cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLacks elements that should be essential for a Predator movie\n\nNaff ending\n\nMuch of the cast feel wasted","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119612,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Hardly","reviewBody":"I'd heard nothing but bad things about The Predator, wall to wall hatred and mockery. It was even suggested that it was one of the worst movies of 2018 and comparable with the messy AVP movies. Going in I was forced to have low expectations, and I firmly disagree.\n\nLet's make something clear, I am not saying The Predator is a good film because it simply isn't but worst of 2018? Absolutely not. It's just a badly flawed addition to the franchise yet manages to be oddly loyal at the same time.\n\nSo a Predator comes to Earth but this time the government is ready for it. Cue lots of action, blood shed but a pretty wafer thin plot that doesn't exactly go anywhere.\n\nWith a stellar cast including Thomas Jane, the stunning Olivia Munn and the excellent Keegan-Michael Key it had no problems on that front. Okay actually I retract that, the leading man Boyd Holbrook is less than impressive and just wasn't up to the task.\n\nWith an odd amount of comedy and levity The Predators tone isn't exactly in keeping with the original movies yet manages to solidly feel like a Predator film thanks to the original score and franchise tropes. I loved the first movie, I thought the second was passable and hated the third but this right here is underwhelming yet perfectly watchable despite the lashings of Hollywoodness it has.\n\nSure it's goofy and badly flawed but I'm not sure exactly what everyone expected. There are certainly a lot of problems with the film, I'd have liked it to be darker, I'd have liked it to be longer and I'd liked the original Predator to have gotten more screentime.\n\nRegardless despite it's many many problems it comes under the category of harmless take your brain out fun.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLoyal score\n\nSome great nods to previous movies\n\nQuite a few very funny moments\n\nDecent cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLacks elements that should be essential for a Predator movie\n\nNaff ending\n\nMuch of the cast feel wasted","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119612,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hardly","reviewBody":"I'd heard nothing but bad things about The Predator, wall to wall hatred and mockery. It was even suggested that it was one of the worst movies of 2018 and comparable with the messy AVP movies. Going in I was forced to have low expectations, and I firmly disagree.\n\nLet's make something clear, I am not saying The Predator is a good film because it simply isn't but worst of 2018? Absolutely not. It's just a badly flawed addition to the franchise yet manages to be oddly loyal at the same time.\n\nSo a Predator comes to Earth but this time the government is ready for it. Cue lots of action, blood shed but a pretty wafer thin plot that doesn't exactly go anywhere.\n\nWith a stellar cast including Thomas Jane, the stunning Olivia Munn and the excellent Keegan-Michael Key it had no problems on that front.

It was even suggested that it was one of the worst movies of 2018 and comparable with the messy AVP movies. Going in I was forced to have low expectations, and I firmly disagree.\n\nLet's make something clear, I am not saying The Predator is a good film because it simply isn't but worst of 2018? Absolutely not. It's just a badly flawed addition to the franchise yet manages to be oddly loyal at the same time.\n\nSo a Predator comes to Earth but this time the government is ready for it. Cue lots of action, blood shed but a pretty wafer thin plot that doesn't exactly go anywhere.\n\nWith a stellar cast including Thomas Jane, the stunning Olivia Munn and the excellent Keegan-Michael Key it had no problems on that front.

All of these films share the same basic formula of 4 or 5 seemingly unrelated stories that ultimately converge on a particular holiday in a big city. If you're familiar with Gary Marshall's illustrious career including iconic films like "Pretty Woman" (1990) and going all the way back to 70s TV with "Happy Days" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley" (and yes! He is married to Penny "Laverne" Marshall who makes a brief but funny cameo in this movie), then you know basically what to expect: good clean fun that won't necessarily change your life or fix the ozone layer, but it's great entertainment for a night. Eeeh slightly on the sappy/predictable side, but heck, what do you expect from a PG-13 movie?\n\nAs with Marshall's other films, the appeal lies largely in a superstar studded cast. Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Ashton Kutcher, Hilary Swank, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jon Bon Jovi (wait... Who?), and buckets of cameos like James Belushi, Ludicrous (argh, IMDb's auto spell checker keeps messing up the spelling), Cary Elwes and Alyssa Milano whose scene actually got cut. However my biggest criticism is that, by splitting the screen time between so many show-stealers in so many little segments, nobody really gets a chance to shine. And for example you may be a little annoyed that a master thespian like Robert De Niro is on screen for only a combined 10 minutes, if even that. Thus, the big names come across as somewhat gimmicky.\n\nMy next biggest criticism is that the jokes and gags weren't that great. At times it felt like the movie was trying too hard to make a lukewarm joke work. You know, like when you start to tell a lame joke at the office water cooler, then in your mind you realize how lame it is, so you try to dramatize it with flourishes and big arm gestures. Yeah because that always works. Not that I do that. Much.\n\nBut then you realize that this really is a tale in the tradition of 70s sitcom, predictable, slightly flat, but with its own distinct style that might make you catch yourself grinning.\n\nGary, if you're out there reading this (yeah because award winning Hollywood directors like to waste their time trolling internet movie sites), I'd like to suggest that the darker, edgier segments work best. For example Ashton Kutcher (whom I normally don't care for) played an excellent role as a misanthropic hipster poseur, sort of a modern day scrooge, who spends his time tearing down party decorations in his apartment building. Most of the other segments were a bit too chipper, and thus they suffered from lack of humorous irony, which, ask Mel Brooks, is important in comedy. Of course, the most important thing in comedy is... well... (insert big arm gesture) ...you know... like... timing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He is married to Penny "Laverne" Marshall who makes a brief but funny cameo in this movie), then you know basically what to expect: good clean fun that won't necessarily change your life or fix the ozone layer, but it's great entertainment for a night. Eeeh slightly on the sappy/predictable side, but heck, what do you expect from a PG-13 movie?\n\nAs with Marshall's other films, the appeal lies largely in a superstar studded cast. Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Ashton Kutcher, Hilary Swank, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jon Bon Jovi (wait... Who?), and buckets of cameos like James Belushi, Ludicrous (argh, IMDb's auto spell checker keeps messing up the spelling), Cary Elwes and Alyssa Milano whose scene actually got cut. However my biggest criticism is that, by splitting the screen time between so many show-stealers in so many little segments, nobody really gets a chance to shine. And for example you may be a little annoyed that a master thespian like Robert De Niro is on screen for only a combined 10 minutes, if even that. Thus, the big names come across as somewhat gimmicky.\n\nMy next biggest criticism is that the jokes and gags weren't that great. At times it felt like the movie was trying too hard to make a lukewarm joke work. You know, like when you start to tell a lame joke at the office water cooler, then in your mind you realize how lame it is, so you try to dramatize it with flourishes and big arm gestures. Yeah because that always works. Not that I do that. Much.\n\nBut then you realize that this really is a tale in the tradition of 70s sitcom, predictable, slightly flat, but with its own distinct style that might make you catch yourself grinning.\n\nGary, if you're out there reading this (yeah because award winning Hollywood directors like to waste their time trolling internet movie sites), I'd like to suggest that the darker, edgier segments work best. For example Ashton Kutcher (whom I normally don't care for) played an excellent role as a misanthropic hipster poseur, sort of a modern day scrooge, who spends his time tearing down party decorations in his apartment building. Most of the other segments were a bit too chipper, and thus they suffered from lack of humorous irony, which, ask Mel Brooks, is important in comedy. Of course, the most important thing in comedy is... well... (insert big arm gesture) ...you know... like... timing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Slade is a portrait of turmoil. Not because he's blind, but because he's never been able to rise above the blindness and still find peace with himself and with the world. One of the great tragic characters of recent years. His story is much like Hickey's in "Iceman Cometh" or Howard Beale's in "Network." They never think they do good in the world with what they have, so they find themselves in this dark hole and they stay there. No one can help them out. No one looks after them. No one feels what they feel. As years go on and opportunities are lost, the dark hole gets filled with a lot anger, sorrow and possibly regret. Can they be healed? Do they want to be healed?  \n\nIn "Scent of a Woman," Pacino presents this dark, gloomy character perfectly in his Oscar winning performance. He overwhelms you with his constant bellowing and ordering of O'Donnell's Charlie. He's a man who never left the Military. My guess is that you can never take the military of out the man, only the man out of the military. He doesn't blame anyone or anything for his blindness. He's man who thinks that somehow, he was destined to "tour the battlefield" this way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":273147,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"duration":"PT2H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is supposed to be a tribute to the original. People who bash this movie without reading Aykroyd's interviews are ignorant to the intent here. This movie was originally to be a sequel back in 1981 just before Belushi died. When that happened, the idea for another adventure fell away. But after almost two decades, Aykroyd wanted to do something to revisit the classic film and pay homage to his friend and co-star Belushi, so he assembled this "Concert Movie", which is supposed to be all about THE MUSIC, not the story. The only reason a story was put in was to keep it moving from musical number to musical number, because everyone knows that straight concert films are pretty boring, even if you really like the performer(s). So here it is, for the true Blues Brothers fans to enjoy. P.S.-And if your problem with the plot was some of the cartoony style actions that occur (Cabel being pulled heavenward and his clothes magically "changing", et cetera), remember that the original had the same things. In the first one the entire band's clothing "magically" changes for a concert, but if you know that this is merely a representation of the character's psychological state and not a literal change, then the film works much better. The same idea works for the much-maligned "zombie" sequence near the end at Queen Mousette's mansion. Also, people complain about the Bluesmobile in this film being able to drive underwater. Well, in the first film the car flew, performed flips, and was nearly indestructible. In fact, if you watch the DVD of the first film, you find in the deleted scenes and "Making-of" section that the Bluesmobile is supposed to be "magic", because it was parked each night inside a power transformer. How is that for cheesiness on the first film? So that also explains Elwood's ability to smuggle himself in the dash of the car in this one, and the car being able to crash land from a fiery loop-de-loop at the fairgrounds. Even though I wish this film could have been a little edgier and darker in tone like the original, I do find its bold and effective use of color to be magnificent and fascinating.

It's a crime story, around the main character, trying to discover who he is, trying to understand what happened to the family he doesn't remember. It's well paced, even though is nothing fully original, these gimmicks were already made. But it is quite intense and powerful, and the main character is very well built.\n\nIt's a story every thriller fan around the world will enjoy for sure, just don't expect to finish with an awesome mood.

The movie is lame mix of futile teen comedy and horror. That's truly awful enough for a start, but the director goes even further with lameness as throwing in various right-wing/patriotic lines in such already disastrous mix. There's lots of urban "humor" combined with suggestive nationalist pseudo-mythology and there's so many desperate tries with even more fails at giving this garbage some kind of social commentary value. There's some people who praise it for it's camp value, but guess what? There's no fun, the movie just plods from fail to fail. The acting is so forgettable and unconvincing, as there's not even a single scene with deep or even real emotions or expressiveness, so the characters are defined just visually. Cool camera and professional mainstream production can't save this movie, as it's totally dire and pointless in itself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1746,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie is lame mix of futile teen comedy and horror. That's truly awful enough for a start, but the director goes even further with lameness as throwing in various right-wing/patriotic lines in such already disastrous mix. There's lots of urban "humor" combined with suggestive nationalist pseudo-mythology and there's so many desperate tries with even more fails at giving this garbage some kind of social commentary value. There's some people who praise it for it's camp value, but guess what? There's no fun, the movie just plods from fail to fail. The acting is so forgettable and unconvincing, as there's not even a single scene with deep or even real emotions or expressiveness, so the characters are defined just visually. Cool camera and professional mainstream production can't save this movie, as it's totally dire and pointless in itself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1746,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hackman is still the "knock down, drag out", shoot first ask later 2-fisted narc that doesn't know what Miranda means that he was in part I, but with a change of scenery that takes him across the pond. The terrain has changed, but the raw unadulterated character acting of Hackman still makes it one hell of a roller coaster ride.\n\nRife with dirty cops, drug smugglers, and French thugs, this movies direction and writing reminds instantly that it is part of the production catalyst that would later see series like The Shield have such success in prime time TV. The 70's rarely pulled punches when it came to top billed cop movies, starting with Dirty Harry, the original French Connection and then snowballing into classics like Serpico. The French Connection II is no exception. This movie won't disappoint any fan of either the original, or anyone that wanted to see for themselves Gene Hackman carrying a lead action role almost through the screen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17205,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Hackman is still the "knock down, drag out", shoot first ask later 2-fisted narc that doesn't know what Miranda means that he was in part I, but with a change of scenery that takes him across the pond. The terrain has changed, but the raw unadulterated character acting of Hackman still makes it one hell of a roller coaster ride.\n\nRife with dirty cops, drug smugglers, and French thugs, this movies direction and writing reminds instantly that it is part of the production catalyst that would later see series like The Shield have such success in prime time TV. The 70's rarely pulled punches when it came to top billed cop movies, starting with Dirty Harry, the original French Connection and then snowballing into classics like Serpico. The French Connection II is no exception. This movie won't disappoint any fan of either the original, or anyone that wanted to see for themselves Gene Hackman carrying a lead action role almost through the screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17205,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Seriously, when the characters behave NOTHING like they did in the original and the objective is to haul an elephant(!), you know you're in trouble.

I mean, what happened to the mild-mannered, likeable, laid-back country boy that we all knew and loved from the first one?

They made them even dumber than in the first, and while there are a few funny lines, it goes into overdrive and messes the whole thing up.  Another thing, Buford's Canadian cousin (I forget his name) was a disgrace.  Was he supposed to be gay?  If so, that wasn't funny either.\n\nI guess I've trashed this one enough.

Ipak, kada mu bogata braća, Mali i Veliki Enos, ponude posao, on i njegov stari, dobri kolega Kledis, bez razmišljanja prihvataju. Umesto piva, sada treba da prevezu - slona! Jedini "problem" je u tome što je u pitanju slonica, koja svaki čas treba da se porodi.

No, Don't get it. the photography and aesthetics are very well done, and camera angles awesome. And seeing Gerard Depardieu in a role for Jean Claude Van damme, you have to see it to believe this reality. I agree that Depardieu deserved better than this, but after all, why not? Gruesome torture scènes and a dark atmosphere, only spoiled by a silly and ankward ending.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.9,"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ljubavna, ali i snažna istorijska priča koja se tiče svih nas, smeštena je u period od avgusta 1913, nakon pobede Srbije u Balkanskim ratovima kada je povratila deo teoritorije, do kraja 1915. godine, kada je austrougarska vojska okupirala Beograd. Glavni junak, mladi srpski oficir, vraća se sa ratišta u rodnu kuću. Svadba mu je, tradicionalno, već zakazana, ali zaplet priče počinje kada ćerka austrougarskog poslanika, koju igra Ivana Dudić, "baci oko" na njega. Nedopustivo za to vreme, koketna mlada dama, ne krije svoja osećanja. Rasplet njihove ljubavne drame (koja je plod mašte autora) odvija se u realnom istorijskom periodu pred Veliki rat, pa se u scenariju pojavljuje još dvadesetak glavnih likova, uglavnom stvarnih istorijskih ličnosti. Biće tu dramatičnih događanja, špijunskih intriga, diplomatskih nadmudrivanja, političkih spletki i prevara...</desc>

Ljubavna, ali i snažna istorijska priča koja se tiče svih nas, smeštena je u period od avgusta 1913, nakon pobede Srbije u Balkanskim ratovima kada je povratila deo teoritorije, do kraja 1915. godine, kada je austrougarska vojska okupirala Beograd.

Svadba mu je, tradicionalno, već zakazana, ali zaplet priče počinje kada ćerka austrougarskog poslanika, koju igra Ivana Dudić, "baci oko" na njega. Nedopustivo za to vreme, koketna mlada dama, ne krije svoja osećanja. Rasplet njihove ljubavne drame (koja je plod mašte autora) odvija se u realnom istorijskom periodu pred Veliki rat, pa se u scenariju pojavljuje još dvadesetak glavnih likova, uglavnom stvarnih istorijskih ličnosti.

She's on the run with her father (David Keith) from various government people wanting to exploit her talent as she tries to control her gift. I haven't read the novel that this movie is based on so I can't comment on what this got right or wrong.

Clocking in just under two-hours, the film feels twice as long and I think a lot of the blame has to go to director Mark L. Lester.

I will say that not all of this might be his fault because the screenplay itself has a fair number of problems.

Heather Locklear does a nice job in her scenes as the mother and we get vets like Martin Sheen and George C. Scott offering up fine performances. The highlight of the film deals with a couple farmers played by Art Carney and Louise Fletcher. Yes, FIRESTARTER has three Oscar-winning actors. The special effects are another plus and help give the film some energy. I must admit that the entire story struck me as being silly and especially early on as we see Keith's character getting nosebleeds from doing his psychic powers and Barrymore crying from setting people on fire.

You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.\n\nYes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary.

I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.\n\nI was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.\n\nYes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34544,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.9,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>
