That however, would be equal to deny any actor making his own interpretation of a new role.\n\nOne of the things that really makes the series «better» is the explanations on screen and via voice-overs. \n\nAnd the claims about «cheesy lines»? Sorry again, this is not Hamlet. Nor is it Ibsen. This is run-of-the-mill-entertainment. This is off-the-rack, not tailor made.\n\nNow, one could discuss the cast, of course.

Yes, it is an updated show, but some of the changes actually makes the new episodes better and more vivid.\n\nVariety's statement that Lucas Till's performance is wooden and clunky, is centered on a stupid hope for a continuance of the old MacGyver. That however, would be equal to deny any actor making his own interpretation of a new role.\n\nOne of the things that really makes the series «better» is the explanations on screen and via voice-overs. \n\nAnd the claims about «cheesy lines»? Sorry again, this is not Hamlet. Nor is it Ibsen. This is run-of-the-mill-entertainment. This is off-the-rack, not tailor made.\n\nNow, one could discuss the cast, of course. But that is merely a matter of flavor. And flavor is like your backside, split in the middle.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I like that they're in their 30's and not all 90210 on viewers. Storyline: Definitely an action show, and it's done adequately. Script: Solid. Some cheesy stuff, some wow stuff, some well acted scenes. A few roll your eyes moments, but that keeps in part with the way the original was. \n\nPros: The script writing. The acting. The actors aren't Hollywood good-looking. But they are a good match with the scripts. Subtle little moments of humour, that you have to see visually and/or hear. Something ha ha will be thrown in there when you least expect it. The building of the characters. You find out little bits here and there and already starting to get a better understanding of how a character is the way he or she is. \n\nCons: The filming of a fight sequence, taking on the bad guys was terrible. That's not a spoiler. You'd fully expect to see one, seeing as it was in a huge amount of TV commercials. It sucks because you can see the distance between them, when they are at blows with each other. The editing is a shambles, it's so crappy in the action sequences. Could be much better. Hire more qualified people, it's worth it. \n\nThe believability of some legal situations are a bit dodgy. That detracts, and makes it a little hard to buy into it. But then again it is not a documentary. It's a TV show that's there to entertain you. Watch yourself a reality show like Cops if you're going to harp on it. \n\nSummarily. My take: I like it because it's fresh. The camaraderie reminds me (a little) of: some Starsky and Hutch, a dash of 21 Jump Street, and yes the feel of the original Hawaii Five-O is there. It's on location on beautiful Oahu, with little studio time in it. Outdoors: That's just how they roll on that island."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67810,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I like that they're in their 30's and not all 90210 on viewers. Storyline: Definitely an action show, and it's done adequately. Script: Solid. Some cheesy stuff, some wow stuff, some well acted scenes. A few roll your eyes moments, but that keeps in part with the way the original was. \n\nPros: The script writing. The acting. The actors aren't Hollywood good-looking. But they are a good match with the scripts. Subtle little moments of humour, that you have to see visually and/or hear. Something ha ha will be thrown in there when you least expect it. The building of the characters. You find out little bits here and there and already starting to get a better understanding of how a character is the way he or she is. \n\nCons: The filming of a fight sequence, taking on the bad guys was terrible. That's not a spoiler. You'd fully expect to see one, seeing as it was in a huge amount of TV commercials. It sucks because you can see the distance between them, when they are at blows with each other. The editing is a shambles, it's so crappy in the action sequences. Could be much better. Hire more qualified people, it's worth it. \n\nThe believability of some legal situations are a bit dodgy. That detracts, and makes it a little hard to buy into it. But then again it is not a documentary. It's a TV show that's there to entertain you. Watch yourself a reality show like Cops if you're going to harp on it. \n\nSummarily. My take: I like it because it's fresh. The camaraderie reminds me (a little) of: some Starsky and Hutch, a dash of 21 Jump Street, and yes the feel of the original Hawaii Five-O is there. It's on location on beautiful Oahu, with little studio time in it. Outdoors: That's just how they roll on that island.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67810,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

Finding its stride in season 2 with a formula which pushes the envelope while still being doable, this series packs ample portions of entertainment into 40 minute episodes while staying fresh, delivering palatable doses of science didactically, and, most of all, manifesting a strong sense of social responsibility in all of its subliminals. While most entertainment aims for the crotch, the gut, or the heart, "CSI" goes for the most difficult target, the head, as it teaches forensics and the empirical process while remaining cooly detached from sensationalism and melodrama all the while using the "truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction" thesis to its and our advantage. The results are fun and interesting lessons in everything from dwarfism to Down syndrome to anatomy to ballistics to etc. all the while maintaining a social conscience.

But it satisfies my first requirement of a good show--I like the characters. Holmes is a man struggling with his inept social skills while simultaneously reveling in them. Watson is a woman whose job has become a hobby and more. As they adapt, this could lead to more interesting interactions. The police characters are skeptical and protective of their turf, yet open to help. They grudgingly admire Holmes' results.\n\nHolmes is also a man who has no love of conventions. It is interesting to watch him navigate his way through a society that tries to force everyone to comply with its standards. In this process, Watson acts as liaison and interpreter. As she gains more information about Holmes, she becomes more useful to him and, perhaps, more of an annoyance to him. He wants to remain an enigma so that he can keep his secrets and demons to himself. She tells him it is good to talk of one's feelings, but he will do so only if forced. One can only hope that the writers eventually create a background for Watson that is equally engaging, though she is somewhat damaged from her experience with a malpractice case. This is only the first season, so there is time for more layers to be added.\n\nRegarding Holmes' crime solving techniques, they are best when he interacts with suspects or witnesses. He has an eye for the truths they reveal when they are trying to hide them. Can he see his own truths as well? Wlll he find the time to deal with his own issues when the world offers so many interesting diversions for his curiosity?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But it satisfies my first requirement of a good show--I like the characters. Holmes is a man struggling with his inept social skills while simultaneously reveling in them. Watson is a woman whose job has become a hobby and more. As they adapt, this could lead to more interesting interactions. The police characters are skeptical and protective of their turf, yet open to help. They grudgingly admire Holmes' results.\n\nHolmes is also a man who has no love of conventions. It is interesting to watch him navigate his way through a society that tries to force everyone to comply with its standards. In this process, Watson acts as liaison and interpreter. As she gains more information about Holmes, she becomes more useful to him and, perhaps, more of an annoyance to him. He wants to remain an enigma so that he can keep his secrets and demons to himself. She tells him it is good to talk of one's feelings, but he will do so only if forced. One can only hope that the writers eventually create a background for Watson that is equally engaging, though she is somewhat damaged from her experience with a malpractice case. This is only the first season, so there is time for more layers to be added.\n\nRegarding Holmes' crime solving techniques, they are best when he interacts with suspects or witnesses. He has an eye for the truths they reveal when they are trying to hide them. Can he see his own truths as well? Wlll he find the time to deal with his own issues when the world offers so many interesting diversions for his curiosity?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While it may not be as bloody as Kingdom of Heaven, the action still remains exciting and brutal. People who have not seen that film will be disappointed by the lack of action and scenes that are too long.\n\nWhile I found the film to be exciting, I couldn't help but realise that this would have been great if it was a 15 (UK age certificate) rather than a 12a. The first action sequence is great as English soldiers attack a French castle but it felt restricted that you would never see any blood when someone is killed; a soldier is shot in the neck by an arrow but other than the arrow, they look completely fine. Early on a character dies but from the way it was edited, you would never have known. A film where the violence is as savage and as brutal as this, requires you to feel as if the characters are in great danger.\n\nA lot has been said about Russell Crowe and his acting in the film but I found little to complain about. He suited his role well. The supporting cast including Mark Strong, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Kevin Durand and Oscar Isaac are fantastic. They are all completely immersed into their roles. I never felt that someone else could have been casted instead. \n\nThe cinematography is also really good but if only it was not let down by the editing. As a sword or axe is flung towards an enemies head, it cuts straight after the impact, loosing a sense of realism. The hurts the film much later on in the final action sequence.\n\nThe film maintained my interest and the final action sequence was exciting. This is a film worth watching but if you are expecting the next Gladiator, I suggest waiting for the director's cut on DVD/ Blu-ray.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":256105,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While it may not be as bloody as Kingdom of Heaven, the action still remains exciting and brutal. People who have not seen that film will be disappointed by the lack of action and scenes that are too long.\n\nWhile I found the film to be exciting, I couldn't help but realise that this would have been great if it was a 15 (UK age certificate) rather than a 12a. The first action sequence is great as English soldiers attack a French castle but it felt restricted that you would never see any blood when someone is killed; a soldier is shot in the neck by an arrow but other than the arrow, they look completely fine. Early on a character dies but from the way it was edited, you would never have known. A film where the violence is as savage and as brutal as this, requires you to feel as if the characters are in great danger.\n\nA lot has been said about Russell Crowe and his acting in the film but I found little to complain about. He suited his role well. The supporting cast including Mark Strong, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Kevin Durand and Oscar Isaac are fantastic. They are all completely immersed into their roles. I never felt that someone else could have been casted instead. \n\nThe cinematography is also really good but if only it was not let down by the editing. As a sword or axe is flung towards an enemies head, it cuts straight after the impact, loosing a sense of realism. The hurts the film much later on in the final action sequence.\n\nThe film maintained my interest and the final action sequence was exciting. This is a film worth watching but if you are expecting the next Gladiator, I suggest waiting for the director's cut on DVD/ Blu-ray.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":256105,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Scenarists Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman have devised a story set 20,000 years ago about an unlikely trio of companions who find themselves making a long trek through a harsh environment in an effort, ostensibly, to return a baby human to the tribe from which he has become separated.  The triumvirate is made up of a deadpan, cynical mammoth, a wisecracking, over-the-top sloth (whose mile-a-minute mouth more than makes up for his legendary slowness) and a malevolent saber-tooth tiger, who learns a thing or two about friendship and teamwork before the adventure is over.\n\n`Ice Age' is at its most amusing in those scenes in which the characters make prescient jokes about their own place in the evolutionary scheme of things.  One particularly clever scene involves the three travelers discovering what looks like an underground museum of natural history encased in ice, replete with ancient creatures caught in naturally occurring, chain-of-life exhibits.  Like most animated films set in the past, `Ice Age' derives much of its humor through the use of anachronism.  We chuckle to hear these creatures applying modern, scientific knowledge to the pre-scientific era in which they are living.\n\nThe animators and designers have done a beautiful job in achieving just the right look for this tale.  The backgrounds have a colorful, clean, streamlined look to them, and the animals themselves, in their appearance and design, provide a witty commentary on evolutionary history.   Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary do superb voiceover work, each achieving just the right tone for the character he has been assigned to play.

Scenarists Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman have devised a story set 20,000 years ago about an unlikely trio of companions who find themselves making a long trek through a harsh environment in an effort, ostensibly, to return a baby human to the tribe from which he has become separated.  The triumvirate is made up of a deadpan, cynical mammoth, a wisecracking, over-the-top sloth (whose mile-a-minute mouth more than makes up for his legendary slowness) and a malevolent saber-tooth tiger, who learns a thing or two about friendship and teamwork before the adventure is over.\n\n`Ice Age' is at its most amusing in those scenes in which the characters make prescient jokes about their own place in the evolutionary scheme of things.  One particularly clever scene involves the three travelers discovering what looks like an underground museum of natural history encased in ice, replete with ancient creatures caught in naturally occurring, chain-of-life exhibits.  Like most animated films set in the past, `Ice Age' derives much of its humor through the use of anachronism.  We chuckle to hear these creatures applying modern, scientific knowledge to the pre-scientific era in which they are living.\n\nThe animators and designers have done a beautiful job in achieving just the right look for this tale.  The backgrounds have a colorful, clean, streamlined look to them, and the animals themselves, in their appearance and design, provide a witty commentary on evolutionary history.   Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary do superb voiceover work, each achieving just the right tone for the character he has been assigned to play.  One could wish, perhaps, for a bit less sentimentality at the end, but that is a minor quibble in a film that works so well for both children and adults.  The kids will revel in the cuteness of the animals and the clever action sequences, while adults will savor the sly knowingness of the evolutionary and historical in-jokes.  Not bad in an era when most films can't find a way to please even ONE audience demographic.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":449170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.\n\nRidley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular.

The film unluckily missed a very well deserved 2010 Oscar birth telling the tale about an unthinkable journey of kinship created between a diverse group of Soviet Gulag escapees. Their journey covers 4,000 miles from Siberia to freedom in India giving meaning to the word incredible. The cinematography is used most majestically by capturing panoramas of the strikingly dangerous yet breathtakingly beautiful landscapes. The splendor of the film goes beyond the wilderness with the selection of a very accurate and diverse cast starring Jim Sturgess ("21"), Ed Harris ("The Rock"), Colin Farrel ("In Bruges"), Saoirse Ronan ("The Lovely Bones"), and Mark Strong ("Sherlock Holmes"). Together they recreate the peril and wonder of the impossible journey on foot that started with the idea of a man named Khabrov (Strong) to break out of the Godforsaken Soviet Gulag in Siberia. A Polish man named Janusz, driven by the fire to get back to his wife, puts the idea into action. An older, wise American known as Mr. Smith (Harris) joins ranks when he hears about Janusz's plans and warns him that Khabarov never had any aspiration to actually leave the place. However, the idea becomes a reality attracting an indebt prisoner named Valka (Farrel) and four other men escaping the Gulag and meeting a young girl named Irena (Ronan) on the path to freedom.\n\nThe story is synonymous with walking more than a marathon every day through harsh terrain, uncontrollable elements and lack of food and water for an open-ended amount of time. The gravity of the story is unmatched by any film released this year; told through the art of cinematography and the acting talents of the cast. Both Oscar worthy aspects of the film, however, the cinematography itself is unmatched by any 2010 film. Also, a lot can be said about the all-star cast concerning Jim Sturges, Ed Harris, Colin Farrel, Mark Strong, and Saoirse Ronan and their superb character portrayals; however, there is one other actor that stands out. A man in the group named Zoran played by Dragos Bucar is able to break through the thin layer of dramatic tension in the film with his clever social humor. The comedy he creates does not take away from the story and instead adds to the story allowing the characters to unwind and have a good time. \n\nThe outcomes to films within the "jailbreak" genre are inevitably easy to predict, therefore, causing films like "The Way Back" to work hard in order to be original. "The Way Back" does a very good job by differentiating the way it is captured on film through its beautiful cinematography; however, great films such as "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Great Escape" will always be on top of the genre. "The Way Back" isn't far off though with its main shortcoming stemming from the ending relying on a storyline tangent not fully developed (not the montage, the montage is great).\n\nThis is the most underrated movie of 2010 with its limited advertising exposure, release and lack of award fulfillment with only one Oscar nomination for Best Make Up (well deserved as the group of survivors' skin is torn apart by the elements).

That anyone could enjoy such a derivative, tongue-in-cheek, low ambition piece of schlock, is surely cause for venomous spleen venting from the serio film brigade. They call them guilty pleasures, but thing is, I just don't feel guilty about having such a wonderfully fun filled great time with the Luc Besson produced Lockout.\n\nPlot? Well it's the future and basically Guy Pearce (Snow) is wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to do stir in stasis until whenever. But up in space at the MS1 prison facility, home to all the maniacs found in "Demolition Man", the president's daughter, do-gooder babe Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), is suddenly taken captive and it's a big hostage situation. This looks like a mission for a serious hard bastard type! Well "Snake Plissken" wasn't available, so they get Snow, who is bulked up, full of wise cracks and has a point to prove. Guess what follows? Yep, complete popcorn frenzy as Pearce and Grace cut a swathe through MS1 and have a date with coolness personified.\n\nOn the way, via a truly gorgeous sci-fi affected Blu-ray print, we will tick off the homages and influences and compare notes with our viewing partners about how it's a "Snake Plissken" movie but with Shane Black type dialogue.

That anyone could enjoy such a derivative, tongue-in-cheek, low ambition piece of schlock, is surely cause for venomous spleen venting from the serio film brigade. They call them guilty pleasures, but thing is, I just don't feel guilty about having such a wonderfully fun filled great time with the Luc Besson produced Lockout.\n\nPlot? Well it's the future and basically Guy Pearce (Snow) is wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to do stir in stasis until whenever. But up in space at the MS1 prison facility, home to all the maniacs found in "Demolition Man", the president's daughter, do-gooder babe Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), is suddenly taken captive and it's a big hostage situation. This looks like a mission for a serious hard bastard type! Well "Snake Plissken" wasn't available, so they get Snow, who is bulked up, full of wise cracks and has a point to prove. Guess what follows? Yep, complete popcorn frenzy as Pearce and Grace cut a swathe through MS1 and have a date with coolness personified.\n\nOn the way, via a truly gorgeous sci-fi affected Blu-ray print, we will tick off the homages and influences and compare notes with our viewing partners about how it's a "Snake Plissken" movie but with Shane Black type dialogue. While those who are partial to a bit of sci-fi design are well served here.

Despite being aired on Showcase, Global and ABC, I didn't really hear too much about this show until the first season was done. With the series being filmed and set in Toronto, I was surprised it took me so long to watch it. This show might be old news to a lot of people but personally, I only know a handful of people who have seen this. So let me give a brief synopsis before getting into the review.\n\nOn the surface, Rookie Blue looks nothing more than a typical police drama with hardly any big name actors (No offence to Missy Peregrym and Gregory Smith) but it is so much more than that. Perhaps it holds a special place in my heart because of its Toronto and Canadian connections. The best way to describe this show is Grey's Anatomy with cops instead of surgeons. Replace the interns with rookies and Seattle Grace with 15 Division and you got yourself, Rookie Blue. The story is focused on 5 rookies (All Canadian actors btw) that just graduated from the academy, and follows their young careers as they experience the hardships of being a police officer both, on and off duty. Each rookie is assigned with a training officer and its a treat to watch the different dynamics of each pair, as well as the dynamics among the rookies as a group - learning together yet competing with one another to gain attention from the top dogs.\n\nThe main star of the show is rookie Andy McNally portrayed by the Montreal beauty, Missy Peregrym (Stick It), she's a cop that has a lot to prove because she carries the baggage of her father, a worn out, burnt out homicide detective. Other rookies include, over achiever, Dov Epstein (Gregory Smith, Everwood), nice-by-the-book-guy, Chris Diaz (Travis Mine), tough girl with an attitude, Gail Peck (Charlotte Sullivan), and the responsible single mother, Traci Nash (Enuka Okuma). Some of the veteran cops include, McNally's training officer, Sam Swarek (Ben Bass) - who's the direct opposite of her, goes by instinct and tends to break the rules to get the job done, homicide detective, Luke Callaghan (Eric Johnson) and Nash's training officer, Noelle Wlliams (Melanie Nicholls-King). With such a big ensemble cast of interesting characters, I need to cut myself short, or I'd be typing forever.\n\nPlease continue reading the full review at: http://goo.gl/3VH68","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" turned out to be a very beautiful and emotional movie, with just a pinch of great comedy added to spice it up.\n\nThe story is about the end of days approaching as an asteroid is bound for Earth, and will destroy the planet upon impact. Dodge (played by Steve Carell) finds himself abandoned by his wife upon this news and tries to go on with his life for the last 21 days before the world comes to end. He gets acquainted with a downstairs neighbor, Penny (played by Keira Knightley) whom he haven't talked with for the past 3 years of living in the same apartment building. These two very different spirits end up on a road trip together to get Dodge to his high school girlfriend and get Penny aboard an airplane for Great Britain. Their journey proves to be more than life changing.\n\nThe storyline for "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" was really great, and bizarre wonderful in a weird way. There is this whole gloomy downtrodden feel to it as people are trying to cope with coming to terms with life ending within 3 weeks. But at the same time, there is such a strong emotional journey taking place as we follow Dodge and Penny on their path to their destinations. The movie is driven by great characters and by superb acting. There is just the right amount of absurd and dark comedy to this movie that helps build up the right atmosphere.\n\nI was genuinely surprised by this movie. I knew that it wouldn't be a horrible movie, because Steve Carell usually delivers great performances and do good comedy. But his deliverance in this movie was just phenomenal. He was so well-cast for this movie. As was Keira Knightley, and their chemistry on the screen was just sizzling.\n\nThe movie also boasts some rather great cameo appearances, all of whom really helped adding to the movie, by actors and actresses such as Rob Corddry, Patton Oswalt, William Petersen and, of course, Martin Sheen.\n\n"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" is a definite to-watch-movie for any movie aficionado, because it is very beautiful and moving in many ways. I am really happy that I sat down to watch this movie. And to top it off, this is the type of movie that leaves you with a parting gift, something to think about; what would you do if you only had 21 days left before the world ended?\n\nOh, and as a final note, if you are prone to tear in beautiful movies, you might keep a tissue at hand for the ending of this movie. Just a word of advice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108580,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" turned out to be a very beautiful and emotional movie, with just a pinch of great comedy added to spice it up.\n\nThe story is about the end of days approaching as an asteroid is bound for Earth, and will destroy the planet upon impact. Dodge (played by Steve Carell) finds himself abandoned by his wife upon this news and tries to go on with his life for the last 21 days before the world comes to end. He gets acquainted with a downstairs neighbor, Penny (played by Keira Knightley) whom he haven't talked with for the past 3 years of living in the same apartment building. These two very different spirits end up on a road trip together to get Dodge to his high school girlfriend and get Penny aboard an airplane for Great Britain. Their journey proves to be more than life changing.\n\nThe storyline for "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" was really great, and bizarre wonderful in a weird way. There is this whole gloomy downtrodden feel to it as people are trying to cope with coming to terms with life ending within 3 weeks. But at the same time, there is such a strong emotional journey taking place as we follow Dodge and Penny on their path to their destinations. The movie is driven by great characters and by superb acting. There is just the right amount of absurd and dark comedy to this movie that helps build up the right atmosphere.\n\nI was genuinely surprised by this movie. I knew that it wouldn't be a horrible movie, because Steve Carell usually delivers great performances and do good comedy. But his deliverance in this movie was just phenomenal. He was so well-cast for this movie. As was Keira Knightley, and their chemistry on the screen was just sizzling.\n\nThe movie also boasts some rather great cameo appearances, all of whom really helped adding to the movie, by actors and actresses such as Rob Corddry, Patton Oswalt, William Petersen and, of course, Martin Sheen.\n\n"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" is a definite to-watch-movie for any movie aficionado, because it is very beautiful and moving in many ways. I am really happy that I sat down to watch this movie. And to top it off, this is the type of movie that leaves you with a parting gift, something to think about; what would you do if you only had 21 days left before the world ended?\n\nOh, and as a final note, if you are prone to tear in beautiful movies, you might keep a tissue at hand for the ending of this movie. Just a word of advice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108580,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was far from perfect, but was it bad enough to warrant a meager 43% score on Rotten Tomatoes? I don't think so. Some of the dialogue landed with a thud and Walton Goggins could've toned it down a bit, but otherwise American ULTRA was a pretty slick little action film. In a year full of spy films, most will forget this little tale of the CIA and experiments gone wrong. Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is a pothead living in rural West Virginia with his longtime girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart). He enjoys a peaceful life of smoking weed and working nights at the local general store and his only concerns are the occasional harassment from the local sheriff and crippling panic attacks whenever he tries to leave town. What Mike doesn't know (or, more accurately, doesn't remember) is that he was once part of an experiment with the CIA where he was trained to be the perfect assassin. When the program started showing adverse mental effects on the subjects, the project was closed and Mike, the most successful of the test subjects, had his memory wiped and was given his new life. But now a young CIA upstart (Topher Grace) sees his chance to make a name for himself in the agency and begins a new operation using his own trained killers to eliminate the remnants of the old program .including Mike. It'd be an easy enough mission, if someone hadn't activated Mike's programming to give him a fighting chance.\n\nAmerican ULTRA had been advertised as a stoner comedy, which was pretty deceiving. This is an action film with an equal balance of dramatic and comedic elements. There are few beats meant to get the audience chuckling but all of them are in the promotional materials, giving the impression this is more HALF BAKED than Jason Bourne. In reality, it's somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. And when you approach it from that angle, it's a pretty fun movie. It's a quick and easy 95 minutes that flies by at a sharp pace. The movie is pretty much in gear from the moment it begins, slowing down for a few brief moments to build on the relationship between Mike and Phoebe. I've seen this movie two or three times now and I haven't been bored yet. On the contrary, I dig it. Jesse Eisenberg is admittedly a strange choice of action star, but it works because Mike isn't supposed to be your average action hero. He's not supposed to be much to look at; as far as we (and he) are concerned, he's just a stoner who draws comics on the long, lonely nights sitting behind a cash register. Eisenberg works for the character because he can do neurotic incredibly well. When Mike starts slaughtering would-be killers with whatever mundane he's got handy, it's just as shocking to himself as it is to them. He has no idea what's happening; one minute he's straightening shelves, the next he's assaulted by a couple of men and he's jamming a spoon into one's neck with skills he's unaware he even has. With this disconnect and the resulting confusion, it's right in Eisenberg's wheelhouse and he rocks it. He's also got fantastic chemistry with Kristen Stewart\n\nIn fact, I'll come out and share my opinion that this is probably one of Stewart's best roles. I made a point of avoiding the TWILIGHT series so I've only really seen her perform as Joan Jett in THE RUNAWAYS and Snow White in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, and I've never shared the contempt most people have for her. I think she's got some skill and I've never seen her as good as she is in American ULTRA. Now, there's a "big reveal" halfway into the film that's a little hard to swallow but, for all of her interactions with Eisenberg and Topher Grace, I loved her. While Eisenberg and Stewart are a perfect pair of heroes, our villains aren't as strong. Topher Grace does really well at portraying smarmy and conniving and his character Yates is both of these things, but he's also too immature for me to believe he would've been promoted as far as he had and been given the opportunity to institute his own crazy operation. I loved his bickering with Stewart and some of his tantrums were amusing but whenever he tried to come across as threatening, he flat-lined. Walton Goggins is the other big baddie of the film as the only CIA super soldier worthy of remembering, Laugher. I love Goggins and it's great to see him in anything, but I hate Laugher's trademark forced hyena laugh with a passion. He's much better later in the film when he brings the craziness down a few pegs and his character starts coming to his senses a bit; I loved the final moments in the last battle between Mike and Laugher, almost as much as I loved this exchange earlier in the film when Laugher is preparing to set fire to a car that Mike's trapped inside:\n\nMike: (yells from inside car) "I hate you!" Laugher: (pauses in dumping gasoline on car to yell back): "Well, I f***in' hate you too, man!"\n\nIt's simple and stupid but it gets a laugh from me. There are a lot of little moments like that where humor peaks through the carnage. John Leguizamo has a small role as Mike's drug dealer that's good for some laughs and Mike's own naivety provides him with some good material. It's a perfect blend, really. I'm disappointed to see the lukewarm-to-cold response American ULTRA received. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm giving it a recommend. I think it's worth it and it might surprise you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86063,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with "Untouchable" because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism'   unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it. \n\nSo, I saw it   and loved it.\n\nThe story of "Untouchable" is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful François Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either. \n\nAnd this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but "Untouchable" goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in "Untouchable", the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul,  well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.\n\nSome movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in "Untouchable", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old  The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding. \n\nMany of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title "Untouchable" referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.\n\nThere are real people in "Untouchable", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. "Untouchable" is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue. \n\nAnd yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":779097,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare!

A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare! Burnt shouldn't be compared with other similar culinary movies in the library and you might relish it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108845,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare! Burnt shouldn't be compared with other similar culinary movies in the library and you might relish it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108845,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.\n\nThe movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.\n\nI feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.\n\nIf I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it.

Caruso, and everyman leading star Shia LaBeouf. These guys took us by storm with the pleasant surprise Disturbia last year, and pretty much anything with the name Spielberg on it has to be at least entertaining, if not excellent. That's what Eagle Eye is.\n\nFirst off, I cannot stress this enough: don't take this movie seriously. Please don't get mad because the movie isn't realistic. I know it's unrealistic. You know it. Shia LaBeouf knows it. That doesn't stop Eagle Eye from being one of the most entertaining and effective thrillers of recent memory. Is it as smart or as gripping as other chase and mystery thrillers such as the Bourne series? Of course not. However, whenever Eagle Eye stretches our minds to the breaking limits with the insanity on screen, it manages to throw in a mind boggling action sequence or two right as we start to get mad.\n\nThe film, very well masked by trailers that really only show the beginning of the film and small pieces of the end, deals with cyber-terrorism and a secret military project dealing with destruction and national security. The US Secretary of Defense is portrayed (Michael Chiklis), it's incredibly unrealistic, has Shia LaBeouf, and has a prominent military character (Anthony Mackie). I can already here the Transformers comparisons flying in. The film also lacks in the originality department elsewhere, as elements of I, Robot and Live Free or Die Hard are also present and quite obvious.\n\nI cannot give enough accolades to whoever thought up this action - Eagle Eye boasts arguably the best action sequences of the year. The CGI is seamless and more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. With car chases to rival the best of them, as well as one of the most clever "on-foot" chases I've ever seen within an airport, Eagle Eye never fails to grab your attention with the incredible action sequences.\n\nNow to our cast, the headliners of which are two of film's biggest rising stars. Both live up to their names and reputations admirably. Shia LaBeouf revisits the "troubled youth" character he created in Disturbia, though his turn here is darker and has more depth. He really stretches some acting muscle in the beginning of the film, and it is because of this early success that we are willing to go along for the ride with him, following, trusting, and believing in his Jerry Shaw. Michelle Monaghan, long one of the most underrated in the business, also helps us believe in her character with a convincing show of emotion early in the film. The whole film, despite the action sequences, rides on the shoulders of the leads. If the audience doesn't like them, the film will ultimately fail. I'm pleased to tell you that they rise to the occasion and carry the film with ease.\n\nOur supporting cast includes veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. Maybe it was the script, but Thornton's character was so stereotypical and overdone that it almost made him laughable - especially towards the end. Chiklis did great in his role as the Secretary of Defense - and the unfortunate "victim" of circumstance. Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie are acceptable in even smaller roles.\n\nI remember when I watched my first D.J. Caruso film a few years ago (Two For the Money), and I remember how much I hated that film. However, Caruso has certainly grown as a filmmaker and has found his niche in the hugely entertaining action blockbuster genre, even if a lot of "movie borrowing" is done. This will be his breakthrough that will allow him a little more freedom as a filmmaker and possibly allow him to blossom into more than just an action film director. The touches of Spielberg are obvious, as the legendary director/producer's presence is only a plus.\n\nEagle Eye, in short, is a summer blockbuster released in September. It feels like a summer film, and has the components of a summer film: explosions, terrorism, and Shia LaBeouf. It is everything you want in an entertaining action thriller. Don't go looking for your super realistic epic here - Eagle Eye prides itself on blowing your mind every way possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":178611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've always been a fan of these creature feature films where animals attack humans. I've seen this one a handful of times and will acknowledge, it isn't great, but its definitely a lot of fun for sure. The synopsis here is a "National Geographic" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest, and deadliest, snake.\n\nIt all begins in a boat on the Amazon River. There's a poacher (Danny Trejo) that's trying to call for help on a radio, but he cannot raise anyone. We see through the eyes of something that chases him up the radio tower on his boat. While up there, he kills himself with a hand gun.\n\nWe then shift to a documentary film crew that is going down the Amazon. They are looking for a Native American tribe that lives in the remote jungle. The director of the film crew is Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez). She has a past with a doctor of anthropology, Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz). It seems they've lost touch, but this trip might help to rekindle. He's an expert on tribes that live in the Amazon. Terri's camera man is Danny Rich (Ice Cube), her sound guy is Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) and the production manager is Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer). The man on camera and narrator is Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde). He is kind of rude, as he tells Denise to take his bags to his room, which she informs him that isn't her job.\n\nTheir barge is captained by Mateo (Vincent Castellanos). Early on we learn the different aspect of the characters. Hyde is uppity and has refined tastes, bringing expensive wine and golf clubs. Wilson and Wuhrer are seeing each other, with both of them acting somewhat childish about it.\n\nAs they begin their journey, they find a boat that is tangled some roots. The stranded man is Paul Serone (Jon Voight). He tells them that he is a snake catcher, which Terri calls him out for being a poacher. There is a moment where Serone and Mateo look at each other, which they seem to know who the other is, but nothing is shared. Serone just asks if they can take him to the next village so they can help him free his boat.\n\nIt actually turns out that they have might need to work together. Serone reveals that he knows the tribe of Native Americans they are looking for. He offers to help him. He doesn't reveal what he is actually trying to do though. The barge comes upon a snake totem and Serone suggests they take a path at a ford. Dr. Cale disagrees, stating that his logic is off and that way should be flooded. They take the other route.\n\nTheir barge gets stuck in some foliage and Dr. Cale goes into the water to free them. Before he can, he panics and begins to convulse. When he is brought back on the barge, his mouth is opened to reveal a wasp. It is large and poisonous. He can't breathe due to the stings, but Serone saves his life by giving him a tracheotomy with a knife and a pen casing. It is then decided that they have to go down the ford he said if they want to get to a hospital in time to save Dr. Cale.\n\nThe problem is that this other way is blocked by a wall. Serone has dynamite and wants to blow it up. Terri contends that the wall is there for a reason and that they do not know what. She is overruled to save Dr. Cale's life. We end up in the area where we saw the poacher in the beginning, but there's something else that is stalking them in the wild.\n\nAs I stated above, I've seen this film a handful of times. It definitely is a fun film, but it also has its flaws. I do really like the premise though. It isn't anything new as we've been seeing films with this idea for a long time. I like that a documentary film crew is going to the wilds to try to find this tribe. Even more than that, I do believe that we could get giant animals like this in isolated areas. It really is quite believable, especially with how difficult these places can be to reach. I like that there's no genetic engineering or anything man has done to influence them, this is just nature allowing it to do its thing.\n\nI really like the idea of Serone as well. He plays on the crew's gullibility. He's lived in these areas for awhile so he really knows things that they don't. When Dr. Cale is incapacitated, there is really no one to check him. He only reveals what you need to know as well. Going even farther, there is an interesting dynamic with Westbridge. He is very rude when he first comes aboard the boat. This is flipped when Serone takes over by commanding him around. I really dug that. There is also another interesting one as we see that stress ruins society. Gary sees what Serone is saying and joins in with his logic. If you know me, I'm nihilistic and it doesn't take much for society to break.\n\nI want to move now to the pacing of the film, which is where I think there are some issues. The film only has a runtime of 69 minutes. It does seem to drag a bit. While watching this, I was thinking and my assessment is that the build up to the film is too slow. We get a lot of action in the later part of the film, but I'm partially checked out by then so it doesn't have as much of an impact. It is interesting though, because I like the characters. I do think that it ends with a pretty solid flurry though.\n\nNext I want to cover the acting, which for the most part is actually pretty solid. Lopez is really good here. She is looking great and I like her character. She is looking out for her crew and doesn't care about the film they're supposed to me making when things take a turn. Cube is also really good. It interesting as he is a watered down version of characters we've seen him in the past, but it works for me. Voight is actually really good, which should surprise you. He makes a really good villain and I think part of that is he's naturally an asshole. The only issue I have is his horrible accent in the film. Stoltz, Hyde, Wilson and Wuhrer as well as the rest of the cast are solid and round out the film for what is needed. I do need to point out that Wuhrer is gorgeous.\n\nThis brings me to the effects of the film where they're hit or miss. I think the practical effects look good. The look of the snake is fine. It does look real and it moves that way as well. The only issue I have is that the head looks awkward at times as it seems closer to the characters, but the film just kind of ignores that. The real issue here is that pretty much all of the CGI doesn't hold up. I'm sure the first time I saw it; I was all in on it. With some time and reflection, it's not very good at all. The film is shot well which is something it has going for it.\n\nNow with that said, this film is definitely a fun creature feature. I think that it has a story that isn't new, but something that is still enjoyable. It does kind of look at society and I really like how Serone plays with this crew. There is a bit of a pacing issue, which doesn't make sense with how action packed the second half of the film is. I did somewhat check out if I'm honest. I do think that the acting is good for the most part, Voight's accent is bad. The effects of the film as I said are hit or miss, with the practical being mostly good and the CGI not so much. The soundtrack of the film is fine and does fit for what is needed. I would say don't come in expecting a great film. This is definitely a film that if you want to have some drinks with friends, it really works there. It is just slightly above average for me though.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://horrorreview.webnode.com/news/anaconda","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've always been a fan of these creature feature films where animals attack humans. I've seen this one a handful of times and will acknowledge, it isn't great, but its definitely a lot of fun for sure. The synopsis here is a "National Geographic" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest, and deadliest, snake.\n\nIt all begins in a boat on the Amazon River. There's a poacher (Danny Trejo) that's trying to call for help on a radio, but he cannot raise anyone. We see through the eyes of something that chases him up the radio tower on his boat. While up there, he kills himself with a hand gun.\n\nWe then shift to a documentary film crew that is going down the Amazon. They are looking for a Native American tribe that lives in the remote jungle. The director of the film crew is Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez). She has a past with a doctor of anthropology, Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz). It seems they've lost touch, but this trip might help to rekindle. He's an expert on tribes that live in the Amazon. Terri's camera man is Danny Rich (Ice Cube), her sound guy is Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) and the production manager is Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer). The man on camera and narrator is Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde). He is kind of rude, as he tells Denise to take his bags to his room, which she informs him that isn't her job.\n\nTheir barge is captained by Mateo (Vincent Castellanos). Early on we learn the different aspect of the characters. Hyde is uppity and has refined tastes, bringing expensive wine and golf clubs. Wilson and Wuhrer are seeing each other, with both of them acting somewhat childish about it.\n\nAs they begin their journey, they find a boat that is tangled some roots. The stranded man is Paul Serone (Jon Voight). He tells them that he is a snake catcher, which Terri calls him out for being a poacher. There is a moment where Serone and Mateo look at each other, which they seem to know who the other is, but nothing is shared. Serone just asks if they can take him to the next village so they can help him free his boat.\n\nIt actually turns out that they have might need to work together. Serone reveals that he knows the tribe of Native Americans they are looking for. He offers to help him. He doesn't reveal what he is actually trying to do though. The barge comes upon a snake totem and Serone suggests they take a path at a ford. Dr. Cale disagrees, stating that his logic is off and that way should be flooded. They take the other route.\n\nTheir barge gets stuck in some foliage and Dr. Cale goes into the water to free them. Before he can, he panics and begins to convulse. When he is brought back on the barge, his mouth is opened to reveal a wasp. It is large and poisonous. He can't breathe due to the stings, but Serone saves his life by giving him a tracheotomy with a knife and a pen casing. It is then decided that they have to go down the ford he said if they want to get to a hospital in time to save Dr. Cale.\n\nThe problem is that this other way is blocked by a wall. Serone has dynamite and wants to blow it up. Terri contends that the wall is there for a reason and that they do not know what. She is overruled to save Dr. Cale's life. We end up in the area where we saw the poacher in the beginning, but there's something else that is stalking them in the wild.\n\nAs I stated above, I've seen this film a handful of times. It definitely is a fun film, but it also has its flaws. I do really like the premise though. It isn't anything new as we've been seeing films with this idea for a long time. I like that a documentary film crew is going to the wilds to try to find this tribe. Even more than that, I do believe that we could get giant animals like this in isolated areas. It really is quite believable, especially with how difficult these places can be to reach. I like that there's no genetic engineering or anything man has done to influence them, this is just nature allowing it to do its thing.\n\nI really like the idea of Serone as well. He plays on the crew's gullibility. He's lived in these areas for awhile so he really knows things that they don't. When Dr. Cale is incapacitated, there is really no one to check him. He only reveals what you need to know as well. Going even farther, there is an interesting dynamic with Westbridge. He is very rude when he first comes aboard the boat. This is flipped when Serone takes over by commanding him around. I really dug that. There is also another interesting one as we see that stress ruins society. Gary sees what Serone is saying and joins in with his logic. If you know me, I'm nihilistic and it doesn't take much for society to break.\n\nI want to move now to the pacing of the film, which is where I think there are some issues. The film only has a runtime of 69 minutes. It does seem to drag a bit. While watching this, I was thinking and my assessment is that the build up to the film is too slow. We get a lot of action in the later part of the film, but I'm partially checked out by then so it doesn't have as much of an impact. It is interesting though, because I like the characters. I do think that it ends with a pretty solid flurry though.\n\nNext I want to cover the acting, which for the most part is actually pretty solid. Lopez is really good here. She is looking great and I like her character. She is looking out for her crew and doesn't care about the film they're supposed to me making when things take a turn. Cube is also really good. It interesting as he is a watered down version of characters we've seen him in the past, but it works for me. Voight is actually really good, which should surprise you. He makes a really good villain and I think part of that is he's naturally an asshole. The only issue I have is his horrible accent in the film. Stoltz, Hyde, Wilson and Wuhrer as well as the rest of the cast are solid and round out the film for what is needed. I do need to point out that Wuhrer is gorgeous.\n\nThis brings me to the effects of the film where they're hit or miss. I think the practical effects look good. The look of the snake is fine. It does look real and it moves that way as well. The only issue I have is that the head looks awkward at times as it seems closer to the characters, but the film just kind of ignores that. The real issue here is that pretty much all of the CGI doesn't hold up. I'm sure the first time I saw it; I was all in on it. With some time and reflection, it's not very good at all. The film is shot well which is something it has going for it.\n\nNow with that said, this film is definitely a fun creature feature. I think that it has a story that isn't new, but something that is still enjoyable. It does kind of look at society and I really like how Serone plays with this crew. There is a bit of a pacing issue, which doesn't make sense with how action packed the second half of the film is. I did somewhat check out if I'm honest. I do think that the acting is good for the most part, Voight's accent is bad. The effects of the film as I said are hit or miss, with the practical being mostly good and the CGI not so much. The soundtrack of the film is fine and does fit for what is needed. I would say don't come in expecting a great film. This is definitely a film that if you want to have some drinks with friends, it really works there. It is just slightly above average for me though.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://horrorreview.webnode.com/news/anaconda","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Action, adventure, and humor blends to perfection in this 80's classic.\n\n'Romancing the Stone' certainly is a fun ride - from beginning to end. They just don't make them like they used to. The chemistry between Douglas and Turner is wonderful, and is the key element to making this good old-fashioned romantic adventure comedy work. Funnyman Danny de Vito was also wonderful!\n\nBeing a comedy, not everything has to be realistic and justified. There are instances when they dodge bullets or escape when it shouldn't be possible, but in the name of adventure one can easily overlook these flaws. 'Romancing the Stone' is a feel-good, laugh-out loud, hold on to your seat adventure ride to enjoy again and again. I absolutely love this!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":84882,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I've always been a fan of these creature feature films where animals attack humans. I've seen this one a handful of times and will acknowledge, it isn't great, but its definitely a lot of fun for sure. The synopsis here is a "National Geographic" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest, and deadliest, snake.\n\nIt all begins in a boat on the Amazon River. There's a poacher (Danny Trejo) that's trying to call for help on a radio, but he cannot raise anyone. We see through the eyes of something that chases him up the radio tower on his boat. While up there, he kills himself with a hand gun.\n\nWe then shift to a documentary film crew that is going down the Amazon. They are looking for a Native American tribe that lives in the remote jungle. The director of the film crew is Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez). She has a past with a doctor of anthropology, Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz). It seems they've lost touch, but this trip might help to rekindle. He's an expert on tribes that live in the Amazon. Terri's camera man is Danny Rich (Ice Cube), her sound guy is Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) and the production manager is Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer). The man on camera and narrator is Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde). He is kind of rude, as he tells Denise to take his bags to his room, which she informs him that isn't her job.\n\nTheir barge is captained by Mateo (Vincent Castellanos). Early on we learn the different aspect of the characters. Hyde is uppity and has refined tastes, bringing expensive wine and golf clubs. Wilson and Wuhrer are seeing each other, with both of them acting somewhat childish about it.\n\nAs they begin their journey, they find a boat that is tangled some roots. The stranded man is Paul Serone (Jon Voight). He tells them that he is a snake catcher, which Terri calls him out for being a poacher. There is a moment where Serone and Mateo look at each other, which they seem to know who the other is, but nothing is shared. Serone just asks if they can take him to the next village so they can help him free his boat.\n\nIt actually turns out that they have might need to work together. Serone reveals that he knows the tribe of Native Americans they are looking for. He offers to help him. He doesn't reveal what he is actually trying to do though. The barge comes upon a snake totem and Serone suggests they take a path at a ford. Dr. Cale disagrees, stating that his logic is off and that way should be flooded. They take the other route.\n\nTheir barge gets stuck in some foliage and Dr. Cale goes into the water to free them. Before he can, he panics and begins to convulse. When he is brought back on the barge, his mouth is opened to reveal a wasp. It is large and poisonous. He can't breathe due to the stings, but Serone saves his life by giving him a tracheotomy with a knife and a pen casing. It is then decided that they have to go down the ford he said if they want to get to a hospital in time to save Dr. Cale.\n\nThe problem is that this other way is blocked by a wall. Serone has dynamite and wants to blow it up. Terri contends that the wall is there for a reason and that they do not know what. She is overruled to save Dr. Cale's life. We end up in the area where we saw the poacher in the beginning, but there's something else that is stalking them in the wild.\n\nAs I stated above, I've seen this film a handful of times. It definitely is a fun film, but it also has its flaws. I do really like the premise though. It isn't anything new as we've been seeing films with this idea for a long time. I like that a documentary film crew is going to the wilds to try to find this tribe. Even more than that, I do believe that we could get giant animals like this in isolated areas. It really is quite believable, especially with how difficult these places can be to reach. I like that there's no genetic engineering or anything man has done to influence them, this is just nature allowing it to do its thing.\n\nI really like the idea of Serone as well. He plays on the crew's gullibility. He's lived in these areas for awhile so he really knows things that they don't. When Dr. Cale is incapacitated, there is really no one to check him. He only reveals what you need to know as well. Going even farther, there is an interesting dynamic with Westbridge. He is very rude when he first comes aboard the boat. This is flipped when Serone takes over by commanding him around. I really dug that. There is also another interesting one as we see that stress ruins society. Gary sees what Serone is saying and joins in with his logic. If you know me, I'm nihilistic and it doesn't take much for society to break.\n\nI want to move now to the pacing of the film, which is where I think there are some issues. The film only has a runtime of 69 minutes. It does seem to drag a bit. While watching this, I was thinking and my assessment is that the build up to the film is too slow. We get a lot of action in the later part of the film, but I'm partially checked out by then so it doesn't have as much of an impact. It is interesting though, because I like the characters. I do think that it ends with a pretty solid flurry though.\n\nNext I want to cover the acting, which for the most part is actually pretty solid. Lopez is really good here. She is looking great and I like her character. She is looking out for her crew and doesn't care about the film they're supposed to me making when things take a turn. Cube is also really good. It interesting as he is a watered down version of characters we've seen him in the past, but it works for me. Voight is actually really good, which should surprise you. He makes a really good villain and I think part of that is he's naturally an asshole. The only issue I have is his horrible accent in the film. Stoltz, Hyde, Wilson and Wuhrer as well as the rest of the cast are solid and round out the film for what is needed. I do need to point out that Wuhrer is gorgeous.\n\nThis brings me to the effects of the film where they're hit or miss. I think the practical effects look good. The look of the snake is fine. It does look real and it moves that way as well. The only issue I have is that the head looks awkward at times as it seems closer to the characters, but the film just kind of ignores that. The real issue here is that pretty much all of the CGI doesn't hold up. I'm sure the first time I saw it; I was all in on it. With some time and reflection, it's not very good at all. The film is shot well which is something it has going for it.\n\nNow with that said, this film is definitely a fun creature feature. I think that it has a story that isn't new, but something that is still enjoyable. It does kind of look at society and I really like how Serone plays with this crew. There is a bit of a pacing issue, which doesn't make sense with how action packed the second half of the film is. I did somewhat check out if I'm honest. I do think that the acting is good for the most part, Voight's accent is bad. The effects of the film as I said are hit or miss, with the practical being mostly good and the CGI not so much. The soundtrack of the film is fine and does fit for what is needed. I would say don't come in expecting a great film. This is definitely a film that if you want to have some drinks with friends, it really works there. It is just slightly above average for me though.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://horrorreview.webnode.com/news/anaconda","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Caruso, and everyman leading star Shia LaBeouf. These guys took us by storm with the pleasant surprise Disturbia last year, and pretty much anything with the name Spielberg on it has to be at least entertaining, if not excellent. That's what Eagle Eye is.\n\nFirst off, I cannot stress this enough: don't take this movie seriously. Please don't get mad because the movie isn't realistic. I know it's unrealistic. You know it. Shia LaBeouf knows it. That doesn't stop Eagle Eye from being one of the most entertaining and effective thrillers of recent memory. Is it as smart or as gripping as other chase and mystery thrillers such as the Bourne series? Of course not. However, whenever Eagle Eye stretches our minds to the breaking limits with the insanity on screen, it manages to throw in a mind boggling action sequence or two right as we start to get mad.\n\nThe film, very well masked by trailers that really only show the beginning of the film and small pieces of the end, deals with cyber-terrorism and a secret military project dealing with destruction and national security. The US Secretary of Defense is portrayed (Michael Chiklis), it's incredibly unrealistic, has Shia LaBeouf, and has a prominent military character (Anthony Mackie). I can already here the Transformers comparisons flying in. The film also lacks in the originality department elsewhere, as elements of I, Robot and Live Free or Die Hard are also present and quite obvious.\n\nI cannot give enough accolades to whoever thought up this action - Eagle Eye boasts arguably the best action sequences of the year. The CGI is seamless and more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. With car chases to rival the best of them, as well as one of the most clever "on-foot" chases I've ever seen within an airport, Eagle Eye never fails to grab your attention with the incredible action sequences.\n\nNow to our cast, the headliners of which are two of film's biggest rising stars. Both live up to their names and reputations admirably. Shia LaBeouf revisits the "troubled youth" character he created in Disturbia, though his turn here is darker and has more depth. He really stretches some acting muscle in the beginning of the film, and it is because of this early success that we are willing to go along for the ride with him, following, trusting, and believing in his Jerry Shaw. Michelle Monaghan, long one of the most underrated in the business, also helps us believe in her character with a convincing show of emotion early in the film. The whole film, despite the action sequences, rides on the shoulders of the leads. If the audience doesn't like them, the film will ultimately fail. I'm pleased to tell you that they rise to the occasion and carry the film with ease.\n\nOur supporting cast includes veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. Maybe it was the script, but Thornton's character was so stereotypical and overdone that it almost made him laughable - especially towards the end. Chiklis did great in his role as the Secretary of Defense - and the unfortunate "victim" of circumstance. Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie are acceptable in even smaller roles.\n\nI remember when I watched my first D.J. Caruso film a few years ago (Two For the Money), and I remember how much I hated that film. However, Caruso has certainly grown as a filmmaker and has found his niche in the hugely entertaining action blockbuster genre, even if a lot of "movie borrowing" is done. This will be his breakthrough that will allow him a little more freedom as a filmmaker and possibly allow him to blossom into more than just an action film director. The touches of Spielberg are obvious, as the legendary director/producer's presence is only a plus.\n\nEagle Eye, in short, is a summer blockbuster released in September. It feels like a summer film, and has the components of a summer film: explosions, terrorism, and Shia LaBeouf. It is everything you want in an entertaining action thriller. Don't go looking for your super realistic epic here - Eagle Eye prides itself on blowing your mind every way possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":178611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Apart from the once in a while visuals, the movie has not been able to get even close to expectations. The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3 &amp; 4, I was expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes rather than being nail-biting, turned out to be hilarious and funny. There isn't a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued to screen.

The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3 &amp; 4, I was expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes rather than being nail-biting, turned out to be hilarious and funny. There isn't a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued to screen.

Nakon avanture svog života u prašumama Južne Amerike, spisateljica Joan Wilder i pustolov kojega glumi Michael Douglas pred novim su izazovima. Nakon samo šest mjeseci, u nastavku velikog hita "Lov na zeleni dijamant", njihova je veza klimava. Barem dok ne nalete na novu zagonetku, koja opet postavlja pitanje gdje je i što je skupocjeni dijamant? Kada je filmska publika posljednji put vidjela Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) i pustolova Jacka Coltona (Michael Douglas), oni su plovili u suton nakon urnebesne avanture u prašumama Južne Amerike. Međutim, romansa ne preživi uvijek završnu špicu i lagodni život ispunjen putovanjima na jahtama uskoro dolazi do zasićenja. Kada se ponovno pridružimo Jacku i Joan, šest mjeseci poslije, njihova je veza klimava, barem dok ne nalete na zagonetku koju kriju dijamanti. Zajedno se upuštaju u novu i još luđu pustolovinu svoga života. "Dragulj s Nila" prati Jacka i Joan na opasnu putu u sjevernu Afriku s njihovom sjenom, Ralphom (Danny DeVito), koji ih još uvijek progoni. Gdje je dijamant? Što je dijamant?</desc>

The new Charlie's Angels movie is cheesy and comical, and it means to be. What we have here is a mindless but fun outing that will have women cheering and guys laughing. Diaz, Liu and Barrymore portray the extraordinarily skilled team of crime-fighters who seem able to do everything except lead a normal life.

Of course things wind up to be more complicated than expected, and the Angels must use their "talents" to save the day. They quickly cross paths with a creepy individual played by Crispin Glover, who some of you my remember as the nerdy George McFly from Back To The Future. He's changed his look a bit since then, and ends up being one of the coolest big screen villains since Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode One, which he was surely patterned after. This film is fun, albeit silly fun, and will entertain you on many levels. First time director McG, pronounced Mick-G, borrows shots and styles from many recent films. The most obvious similarities come from The Matrix, allowing our heroes and villains to defy the laws of physics on numerous occasions. All of the fight scenes are spectacular and nicely choreographed, with the exception of one involving Drew Barrymore towards the end. You would think with all of the fancy wirework and effects capability that they could at least give the illusion of Drew's kicks connecting with the bad guys. Bill Murray adds some nice extra comedy to an already funny film. Don't expect any Academy Award nominations, but definitely expect a sequel. Mind-numbing entertainment can be great if you're in the right mood."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":178209,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Likewise the cast don't do a great deal but at least they seem to be having fun and at least not take it too seriously. Although I'm not about to claim he is anything other than a muscle-bound cable television actor, I was quite won over by Sorbo's charisma and good humour  he makes a good lead for stuff at this sort of level. Despite being stuck in a silly red wig that does nothing for her looks, Carrere enjoys overacting in a vampy role which is good even if she has little screen time. Lombard has a plainer, less fun role but I did enjoy her and she worked well with Sorbo. The princes are quite fun, in particular Griffith and, as always, Fierstein camps in up in the way only he can. None of them are great but at least they make the film seem like a bit more fun.\n\nOverall this is not the film to come to if you don't like the genre or have standards higher that daytime television (Hercules is now a kids TV filler on channel 5 here) but if you like that sort of thing then this does just about enough to be an entertaining little bit of modern sword and sorcery in the mould of, well, everything else Sorbo has been in!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7837,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

None of it makes any real sense and it's often unclear what on earth is going on. The movie just jumps from scene to scene with little thought for the sense of it all.\n\nThe movie also ends, not with a typical Chan action scene, but with a highway scene that uses none of Chan's talents, is confused and lacks any sort of excitement or suspense. It is a huge misstep in a film full of small missteps.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16578,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are some clever scenes, and while some, particularly one in which a naked Jackie tries to cover himself while his enemies seem determined to keep them off, make no sense, they are amusing.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is an absolute mess. None of it makes any real sense and it's often unclear what on earth is going on. The movie just jumps from scene to scene with little thought for the sense of it all.\n\nThe movie also ends, not with a typical Chan action scene, but with a highway scene that uses none of Chan's talents, is confused and lacks any sort of excitement or suspense. It is a huge misstep in a film full of small missteps.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16578,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, although I don't remember every single detail, the essential feelings as well as some of the vivid images still seem fresh in my mind, particularly the glittering performance of Koji Yakusyo and Tamiyo Kusakari.\n\nThe Hollywood remake, while not as good as the Japanese original, is at least passing grade, in capturing the essence of the film, 'a man seeking not so much a woman as an answer to his question. Why is she sad? What is she thinking' (Ebert, on 'Shall We Dansu', NOT 'Shall We Dance'), as well as everybody's passion for ballroom dancing.\n\nRichard Gere continues to exude his charm on the female audience. Jennifer Lopez, following Maid in Manhattan, continues to get more comfortable with more matured roles. Oscar best actress (and 5 times nominee) Susan Sarandon is dependable as ever. I'm trying very hard to think of a movie in which I can't find Stanley Tucci and    darn it, the more I watch the guy, the more I like him!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, although I don't remember every single detail, the essential feelings as well as some of the vivid images still seem fresh in my mind, particularly the glittering performance of Koji Yakusyo and Tamiyo Kusakari.\n\nThe Hollywood remake, while not as good as the Japanese original, is at least passing grade, in capturing the essence of the film, 'a man seeking not so much a woman as an answer to his question. Why is she sad? What is she thinking' (Ebert, on 'Shall We Dansu', NOT 'Shall We Dance'), as well as everybody's passion for ballroom dancing.\n\nRichard Gere continues to exude his charm on the female audience. Jennifer Lopez, following Maid in Manhattan, continues to get more comfortable with more matured roles. Oscar best actress (and 5 times nominee) Susan Sarandon is dependable as ever.

After what I felt was an iconic debut, the series has always remained consistently interesting, with one of the most compelling and ever expanding plots in film history. People may complain that the series is in decline, but what people need to realize is that each part is astronomically better than the corresponding parts of other horror series (for example, Saw IV is better than Halloween IV, or the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street film). The same holds true for Saw V, though the film definitely shows that the series is in decline and needs to end soon before it descends into pure absurdity.\n\nA universal truth of the Saw series is that every entry, no matter who does it, will always be well written and contain a plot twist or two at the end. Again, Saw V continues the tradition of revealing the 'huge' (if you could call it that) twist whilst "Hello Zepp" by Charlie Clouser plays in the background. The film answers as many questions as it raises, and serves as more of an origin movie, like Saw IV did. Only this time, the origin doesn't focus on John Kramer/Jigsaw, and therein lies the problem.\n\nWhy does Saw V fail to impress me? Simple. Not enough Jigsaw. Tobin Bell, who has managed to create an iconic villain over the last 5 years, delivers another sublime performance that is not to missed in the world of horror as perhaps the greatest villain of the decade. It really amazed me how Saw IV had the best acting of the series, but just one movie later, pretty much every performer falls flat on their face. This is especially sad considering most of the cast are returning characters, except your typical "why is this happening to me! AHHH!" type characters (which got unbearably annoying, considering they killed off the two least annoying ones first). Meagan Good and Costas Mandylor are acceptable in their roles, however.\n\nBack to the lack of Jigsaw. Tobin Bell really doesn't physically appear that much in the movie, and that is far and away its biggest flaw. The film is similar to Saw II more than the others. To get my drift a little better, imagine the second film, except reduce Jigsaw's screen time by about half. Yeah. This is the only weakness of the screenplay for me, which appears to have matured from the over the top torture porn in Saw III and the ridiculous attempt to run Saw IV concurrently with its predecessor. The film's biggest flaw is in the acting and lack of Jigsaw. Besides this, I really felt that it fit the mold as a worthy entry to the series.\n\nAfter watching this, however, I no longer feel that Saw is the standard of excellence in horror as it once was. That said, the film has the advantage of being short and never dragging. It's well paced and will more than deliver the thrills. Another thing I feel obligated to mention is that this is the least scariest film in the series, which is okay, because unlike every other cheap horror film, Saw V doesn't try to be scary. It's more of a thriller with some gruesome images (like the first film) than a full blown horror movie (like parts II &amp; III).\n\nIn the end, what it comes down to as far as your ability to enjoy the movie, you have to ask yourself this question: "why do I watch the Saw series?". If you watch it for the story and plot twists, you should be at least satisfied, if not entertained. If you watch the series for pure shock and awe and disgust, you'll be disappointed, because Saw V does not try to be a horror film outside of a few scenes. It's a decent entry to the series that is tolerable, despite a lack of the iconic Jigsaw, horrid acting, and a somewhat predictable plot twist (easily the most predictable of the series).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":117178,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After what I felt was an iconic debut, the series has always remained consistently interesting, with one of the most compelling and ever expanding plots in film history. People may complain that the series is in decline, but what people need to realize is that each part is astronomically better than the corresponding parts of other horror series (for example, Saw IV is better than Halloween IV, or the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street film). The same holds true for Saw V, though the film definitely shows that the series is in decline and needs to end soon before it descends into pure absurdity.\n\nA universal truth of the Saw series is that every entry, no matter who does it, will always be well written and contain a plot twist or two at the end. Again, Saw V continues the tradition of revealing the 'huge' (if you could call it that) twist whilst "Hello Zepp" by Charlie Clouser plays in the background. The film answers as many questions as it raises, and serves as more of an origin movie, like Saw IV did. Only this time, the origin doesn't focus on John Kramer/Jigsaw, and therein lies the problem.\n\nWhy does Saw V fail to impress me? Simple. Not enough Jigsaw. Tobin Bell, who has managed to create an iconic villain over the last 5 years, delivers another sublime performance that is not to missed in the world of horror as perhaps the greatest villain of the decade. It really amazed me how Saw IV had the best acting of the series, but just one movie later, pretty much every performer falls flat on their face. This is especially sad considering most of the cast are returning characters, except your typical "why is this happening to me! AHHH!" type characters (which got unbearably annoying, considering they killed off the two least annoying ones first). Meagan Good and Costas Mandylor are acceptable in their roles, however.\n\nBack to the lack of Jigsaw. Tobin Bell really doesn't physically appear that much in the movie, and that is far and away its biggest flaw. The film is similar to Saw II more than the others. To get my drift a little better, imagine the second film, except reduce Jigsaw's screen time by about half. Yeah. This is the only weakness of the screenplay for me, which appears to have matured from the over the top torture porn in Saw III and the ridiculous attempt to run Saw IV concurrently with its predecessor. The film's biggest flaw is in the acting and lack of Jigsaw. Besides this, I really felt that it fit the mold as a worthy entry to the series.\n\nAfter watching this, however, I no longer feel that Saw is the standard of excellence in horror as it once was. That said, the film has the advantage of being short and never dragging. It's well paced and will more than deliver the thrills. Another thing I feel obligated to mention is that this is the least scariest film in the series, which is okay, because unlike every other cheap horror film, Saw V doesn't try to be scary. It's more of a thriller with some gruesome images (like the first film) than a full blown horror movie (like parts II &amp; III).\n\nIn the end, what it comes down to as far as your ability to enjoy the movie, you have to ask yourself this question: "why do I watch the Saw series?". If you watch it for the story and plot twists, you should be at least satisfied, if not entertained. If you watch the series for pure shock and awe and disgust, you'll be disappointed, because Saw V does not try to be a horror film outside of a few scenes. It's a decent entry to the series that is tolerable, despite a lack of the iconic Jigsaw, horrid acting, and a somewhat predictable plot twist (easily the most predictable of the series).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":117178,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has a great cast, Amanda Tapping at her best. The premise of the show....excellent, offer sanctuary to those that might be "different" than the "normal" humans. the storyline is great....\n\nNow, the show just seems to be missing something. Maybe, as another reviewer put it, the show needs to pick up the pace a bit. It is certainly thought provoking. I cannot say the show is bad, nor can I say that it is great. I'll close by saying that it is certainly worth a watch, probably need to view a few episodes before making any kind of decision either way. \n\nI just can't get into it for some unknown reason.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19464,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Saw 4 plays more like a detective story lifted from a page of a who-dun-it novel. This time, we delve deeper into John's past, his ex-wife, and the real secrets about what made him Jigsaw. During his autopsy, it's reveled his stomach contains an audio tape. The tape warns that his work will continue.\n\nIt seems that die-hard fans don't wish to know about what's in the story, since I had to re-edit my comment so that none of the story would be revealed (except that which you see in the ads anyway). In my previous comment, I said nothing about the ending, yet just giving away some of the plot is enough of a no-no. I don't blame them, since this 4th outing has too many elements that make it easier to predict what's going to happen. Regardless, you'd have to be some kind of rare genius to figure out what will happen in the end.\n\nThe series has flowed like a smooth, well-oiled Rube Goldberg machine. It's the most complex of the bunch, in some ways, outdoing the previous ones. I repeat: it begs to be watched again. Just when you thought that the previous Saw Traps had done everything they can to a human body, this one has some clever ones of it's own (not as gruesome as Saw 3, though). The autopsy scene is set to the extreme; the MPAA stating that most viewers have now gotten used to seeing programs like CSI and other medical procedures, so they let this slide easier. \n\nDeceptive, dark, very edgy and well written, the Saw series can easily end here. It's almost necessary to have watched the previous Saws, but can stand on it's own as one of the best of the chapters. Of course, it leaves it open for yet another in the series, which will be in production soon. I don't know when I will tire of the series, but honestly, I can't wait to see what other delicious traps they cook up next.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142364,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Saw 4 plays more like a detective story lifted from a page of a who-dun-it novel. This time, we delve deeper into John's past, his ex-wife, and the real secrets about what made him Jigsaw. During his autopsy, it's reveled his stomach contains an audio tape. The tape warns that his work will continue.\n\nIt seems that die-hard fans don't wish to know about what's in the story, since I had to re-edit my comment so that none of the story would be revealed (except that which you see in the ads anyway). In my previous comment, I said nothing about the ending, yet just giving away some of the plot is enough of a no-no. I don't blame them, since this 4th outing has too many elements that make it easier to predict what's going to happen. Regardless, you'd have to be some kind of rare genius to figure out what will happen in the end.\n\nThe series has flowed like a smooth, well-oiled Rube Goldberg machine. It's the most complex of the bunch, in some ways, outdoing the previous ones. I repeat: it begs to be watched again. Just when you thought that the previous Saw Traps had done everything they can to a human body, this one has some clever ones of it's own (not as gruesome as Saw 3, though). The autopsy scene is set to the extreme; the MPAA stating that most viewers have now gotten used to seeing programs like CSI and other medical procedures, so they let this slide easier. \n\nDeceptive, dark, very edgy and well written, the Saw series can easily end here. It's almost necessary to have watched the previous Saws, but can stand on it's own as one of the best of the chapters. Of course, it leaves it open for yet another in the series, which will be in production soon. I don't know when I will tire of the series, but honestly, I can't wait to see what other delicious traps they cook up next.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142364,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has a great cast, Amanda Tapping at her best. The premise of the show....excellent, offer sanctuary to those that might be "different" than the "normal" humans. the storyline is great....\n\nNow, the show just seems to be missing something. Maybe, as another reviewer put it, the show needs to pick up the pace a bit. It is certainly thought provoking. I cannot say the show is bad, nor can I say that it is great. I'll close by saying that it is certainly worth a watch, probably need to view a few episodes before making any kind of decision either way. \n\nI just can't get into it for some unknown reason.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19464,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Detective Jack, he is a Man's man...my husband never grows tired of putting up with the girl's antics because there's just enough testosterone to balance. And, sex too so probably not appropriate for whatever you parents think is not appropriate for inappropriate you-know! Not every show but, may want to watch first...or keep this fun show for you and the man to cuddle up too. The ENTIRE cast is a blast!!

This time, its simply superb. Well cast and directed, with sumptuous Cornish scenery, the first episode introduces the main characters with a great deal of skill. We are not shown everything and not all is obvious, so there is an element of guesswork for the viewer, which always adds to the enjoyment. I can't wait for episode 2 and the others. Its fabulous, and shows how very skillful the team who put this together are. The narrative has strong sub texts which add richness to the feel of this and the acting is very fine. The whole experience was rich, costume and storyline, suspense and symbolism of the man who will not take hand-outs but instead, chooses to make his own way despite the fists of fortune punching his nose...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26999,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dowager Queen Elizabeth cast in this series does not hold a candle to the Dowager Queen Elizabeth in TWQ.\n\nMinus one star for fumble of a pilot; minus one star for Dowager Queen Elizabeth. They definitely should have brought back the original actress. The only original actor from the original series is Duchess Cecily, King Edward's grumpy Lady Mother.\n\nIt is *not* The White Queen, but it's still a good series. Just a corny pilot.

It doesn't have the richest plot ever. What it has is Bill Murray and Owen Wilson teaming up with Wes Anderson to portray a wonderful story. To like any of those three involved is to like this film. Definitely worth 2 hours out of any life, unless you'll be dying in less than 2 hours. This movie signifies the new way of storytelling for movies to come for years. The days of the old-fashioned drama starring a powerful actor, supported by wonderful character actors is over. To be a good movie anymore, the lead must have the capability to play more than himself in real life (i.e. Bruce Willis is always Bruce Willis). Bill Murray fits the mold perfectly, as he portrays the washed-up sea adventurer. Not to mention the wonderful cast around him, the best performance coming possibly from Willem Dafoe (who is great in every movie he's in)."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It doesn't have the richest plot ever. What it has is Bill Murray and Owen Wilson teaming up with Wes Anderson to portray a wonderful story. To like any of those three involved is to like this film. Definitely worth 2 hours out of any life, unless you'll be dying in less than 2 hours. This movie signifies the new way of storytelling for movies to come for years. The days of the old-fashioned drama starring a powerful actor, supported by wonderful character actors is over. To be a good movie anymore, the lead must have the capability to play more than himself in real life (i.e. Bruce Willis is always Bruce Willis). Bill Murray fits the mold perfectly, as he portrays the washed-up sea adventurer. Not to mention the wonderful cast around him, the best performance coming possibly from Willem Dafoe (who is great in every movie he's in).","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

'Annabelle' is inevitably compared to them, but to me it doesn't compare favourably and could have been much better.

Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do good jobs, though take a backseat to the younger cast.

Although there are moments of scares and suspense, there are not enough of either and could have done with more build up that would have made them less predictable.\n\nDid feel that the pacing was still very flawed. 'Annabelle Comes Home' takes too long to get going and then the climactic parts feel very rushed. The ending is one of the film's biggest issues, as well as being rushed it was very anti-climactic and bordered on plain ridiculous, as well as illogical.

Maybe it's because he focuses on the one thing that matters most in storytelling: compelling characters. And Creed II is full of them.\n\nFirst, there's Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), the brooding, bratty, world champion with a chip on his shoulder. There's Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), the downtrodden wise sage who only recognizes his role in things when the chips are down. There's Bianca Taylor, a talented singer suffering from hearing loss and her love for a self-destructive boxer. There's Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), the weary widow of Apollo Creed who is consistently forced to check her man-child son, and then there are the villains. Ivan and Victor Drago (Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu), the Russian outcasts seeking redemption for the failures of Ivan Drago. Everyone has a purpose in this film, and everyone has a place in moving the narrative forward: avenging the actions of Rocky IV.\n\nThis is a straight-up reboot of a Cold War classic, complete with the final match taking place in Russia. You know what to expect. The challenge from Ivan's son is the kind of storybook rematch the sports world loves. You know Creed has to take the fight to prove himself. And you know at some point, Victor Drago will get the better of him, setting us up for a training montage that never seems to get old. You see, when Rocky IV was released, it wasn't just a boxing film, it was practically a propaganda film about the superiority of American values and ideals. In Creed II, it's not about the country--it's personal. It's about discovering what matters most to you in your career and your own life. And as cliched as that may all sound, it works amazingly well in this film, thanks in part to the strength of the movies character development, phenomenal actors who keep the theatrical bits grounded and brilliant fight choreography and cinematography to settle scores.\n\nI'll be straight with you, we shouldn't like Adonis Creed, but we do. He's a temperamental grown man baby that even knocks himself in the movie for "acting like a b---h." We shouldn't care about Victor Drago--he's a carbon copy of his android like father Ivan and barely has enough dialogue earn a film credit. But we do because we know that his father is living through him. The once powerful Ivan is an outcast in his homeland, and Victor's mother walked out on both of them because she has no respect for losers, so they're surprisingly sympathetic characters in their quest to be menacing. And we shouldn't care about Rocky's meandering ruminations about putting family over boxing when at no point in his career, did he ever do the same. Yet somehow this movie manages to make you care because the film understands that it's real power are in those small reflective moments building up to the fight. Moments like Creed's return to the local cheesesteak house and being welcomed by the fans who urge him to take the battle against Drago. Moments like Bianca and Adonis laying on the floor together like they did in the first film pondering their relationship and what Adonis's decision means for them. It's moments like Rocky pondering the broken relationship he has with his own son and trying to figure out if he dares to make amends. This is the glue that holds these films together--putting family above career and ego. And when it finally comes time to fight, your emotions are so heavily invested in the outcome that you'll find yourself (as did my audience) verbally cheering on Adonis Creed.\n\nAnd in the end, it's the smallest of gestures by Sylvester Stallone (which I won't spoil) that lets you know that Rocky Balboa has nothing left to give and it is now Adonis Creed's time to shine in whatever sequel they have planned for us. Creed II a great time at the movies, even if it's a predictable one.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Creed II a great time at the movies, even if it's a predictable one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Maybe it's because he focuses on the one thing that matters most in storytelling: compelling characters. And Creed II is full of them.\n\nFirst, there's Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), the brooding, bratty, world champion with a chip on his shoulder. There's Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), the downtrodden wise sage who only recognizes his role in things when the chips are down. There's Bianca Taylor, a talented singer suffering from hearing loss and her love for a self-destructive boxer. There's Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), the weary widow of Apollo Creed who is consistently forced to check her man-child son, and then there are the villains. Ivan and Victor Drago (Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu), the Russian outcasts seeking redemption for the failures of Ivan Drago. Everyone has a purpose in this film, and everyone has a place in moving the narrative forward: avenging the actions of Rocky IV.\n\nThis is a straight-up reboot of a Cold War classic, complete with the final match taking place in Russia. You know what to expect. The challenge from Ivan's son is the kind of storybook rematch the sports world loves. You know Creed has to take the fight to prove himself. And you know at some point, Victor Drago will get the better of him, setting us up for a training montage that never seems to get old. You see, when Rocky IV was released, it wasn't just a boxing film, it was practically a propaganda film about the superiority of American values and ideals. In Creed II, it's not about the country--it's personal. It's about discovering what matters most to you in your career and your own life. And as cliched as that may all sound, it works amazingly well in this film, thanks in part to the strength of the movies character development, phenomenal actors who keep the theatrical bits grounded and brilliant fight choreography and cinematography to settle scores.\n\nI'll be straight with you, we shouldn't like Adonis Creed, but we do. He's a temperamental grown man baby that even knocks himself in the movie for "acting like a b---h." We shouldn't care about Victor Drago--he's a carbon copy of his android like father Ivan and barely has enough dialogue earn a film credit. But we do because we know that his father is living through him. The once powerful Ivan is an outcast in his homeland, and Victor's mother walked out on both of them because she has no respect for losers, so they're surprisingly sympathetic characters in their quest to be menacing. And we shouldn't care about Rocky's meandering ruminations about putting family over boxing when at no point in his career, did he ever do the same. Yet somehow this movie manages to make you care because the film understands that it's real power are in those small reflective moments building up to the fight. Moments like Creed's return to the local cheesesteak house and being welcomed by the fans who urge him to take the battle against Drago. Moments like Bianca and Adonis laying on the floor together like they did in the first film pondering their relationship and what Adonis's decision means for them. It's moments like Rocky pondering the broken relationship he has with his own son and trying to figure out if he dares to make amends. This is the glue that holds these films together--putting family above career and ego. And when it finally comes time to fight, your emotions are so heavily invested in the outcome that you'll find yourself (as did my audience) verbally cheering on Adonis Creed.\n\nAnd in the end, it's the smallest of gestures by Sylvester Stallone (which I won't spoil) that lets you know that Rocky Balboa has nothing left to give and it is now Adonis Creed's time to shine in whatever sequel they have planned for us. Creed II a great time at the movies, even if it's a predictable one.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Creed II a great time at the movies, even if it's a predictable one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Sluškinjina priča</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Serija prati ženu prisiljenu živjeti kao konkubina pod fundamentalističkom teokratskom diktaturom u bliskoj budućnosti u totalitarnom Gileadu, gdje ženska prava u osnovi ne postoje. Adaptacija klasičnog romana Margaret Atwood, "Sluškinjina priča" govori o životu u distopiji Gileada, totalitarnog društva u nekadašnjim Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama. Suočeni s ekološkom katastrofom i oštrim padom nataliteta, Gileadom vlada izopačeni fundamentalizam u svom militariziranom "povratku tradicionalnim vrijednostima". Kao jedna od rijetkih preostalih plodnih žena, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) je Sluškinja u Zapovjednikovu kućanstvu, jedna iz kaste žena prisiljenih na seksualno ropstvo u posljednjem očajničkom pokušaju da se svijet ponovno napuči. Emmyjem nagrađena dramska serija vraća se s drugom sezonom koja se vrti oko Offredine trudnoće i njezine trajne borbe da oslobodi svoje buduće dijete iz distopijskih užasa Gileada. "Gilead je u tebi", omiljena je uzrečica tete Lydije. U drugoj sezoni Offred i svi naši likovi borit će se protiv ove mračne istine - ili joj podleći.</desc>

Ben Affleck has a way of writing about life on the streets in Boston that just grabs you. Good Will Hunting was a fine example of that but Gone Baby Gone displayed his directing abilities as well.

Yet he also brought this authenticity in his acting like Ben did in his directing. Youn could just see the look in his eyes that he was totally into it, he was it. He gave a great portrayal of a detective that should have earned him an Oscar nomination. Also a great supporting cast was put in place with Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Amy Ryan. All of them gave engaging performances as well. Amy Ryan especially with her performance as the mother of her girl who is the centerpiece of this story. I believe if it was not for her this movie could have very easily fallen into an ordinary movie. \n\nWhat really made up the movie was the message. After all what is a movie without a message. This movie did not try to pretend to be deep or try to impress. It did what it had to do, asking the a very tough question. Is the right thing to do always the right decision to make and do the ends justify the means? I advise you not to miss this movie and definitely watch this with a friend or family member.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254591,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Suočeni s ekološkom katastrofom i oštrim padom nataliteta, Gileadom vlada izopačeni fundamentalizam u svom militariziranom "povratku tradicionalnim vrijednostima". Kao jedna od rijetkih preostalih plodnih žena, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) je Sluškinja u Zapovjednikovu kućanstvu, jedna iz kaste žena prisiljenih na seksualno ropstvo u posljednjem očajničkom pokušaju da se svijet ponovno napuči. Emmyjem nagrađena dramska serija vraća se s drugom sezonom koja se vrti oko Offredine trudnoće i njezine trajne borbe da oslobodi svoje buduće dijete iz distopijskih užasa Gileada. "Gilead je u tebi", omiljena je uzrečica tete Lydije. U drugoj sezoni Offred i svi naši likovi borit će se protiv ove mračne istine - ili joj podleći.</desc>

Truly exceptional adaptation of Dickens really shows how terrific writing can allow a film to work.  Yes, the cast was very capable and in fact, Christopher Plummer was  multi-layered, pure evil as Uncle Ralph.  The Squeers team of veterans Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson made escape from their "school" seem the only rational approach. Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous and capable as Nicholas, and herein lies the problem.  While not for the youngest of kids, those 12 and up would probably enjoy the movie very much.  As a way to touch Dickens, this is easily the least painful and most accessible for 7th through 12th graders.  Why aren't audience was filled with 40 and 50 somethings who read the novel growing up and a few (like me) brought teenagers with them.  My daughter and her friends loved it!  Very frustrating that studios will sink millions into drawing crowds for trash like "Planet of the Apes", "XXX", "Blue Crush", etc but almost nothing into this.  Of course, this offers an education in story structure and the supporting casting was inspired.  In addition to Hunnam, Anne Hathaway ("Princess Diaries"), Jamie Bell ("Billy Elliot"), Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming were all excellent.  Tom Courtenay was funny and pitiful at the same time.  Yes, the story is like much of Dickens, it provides hope for those who seem to have little.  Good prevails over evil.  Personally, I like that approach.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Truly exceptional adaptation of Dickens really shows how terrific writing can allow a film to work.  Yes, the cast was very capable and in fact, Christopher Plummer was  multi-layered, pure evil as Uncle Ralph.  The Squeers team of veterans Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson made escape from their "school" seem the only rational approach. Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous and capable as Nicholas, and herein lies the problem.  While not for the youngest of kids, those 12 and up would probably enjoy the movie very much.  As a way to touch Dickens, this is easily the least painful and most accessible for 7th through 12th graders.  Why aren't audience was filled with 40 and 50 somethings who read the novel growing up and a few (like me) brought teenagers with them.  My daughter and her friends loved it!  Very frustrating that studios will sink millions into drawing crowds for trash like "Planet of the Apes", "XXX", "Blue Crush", etc but almost nothing into this.  Of course, this offers an education in story structure and the supporting casting was inspired.  In addition to Hunnam, Anne Hathaway ("Princess Diaries"), Jamie Bell ("Billy Elliot"), Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming were all excellent.  Tom Courtenay was funny and pitiful at the same time.  Yes, the story is like much of Dickens, it provides hope for those who seem to have little.  Good prevails over evil.  Personally, I like that approach.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I loved it!!! Now 12 years later a finally purchase the film on DVD (ordered from the states as I can't find it anywhere in New Zealand) and I watched it with a couple friends who have never seen it before. Suddenly I was 14 again! A scared child, too frightened to look away from the screen. Caught in an icy grip of fear and excitement! A feeling I haven't felt since the first viewing of 'Event Horizon'. Brilliant! I jumped in all the same scenes I jumped in 12 years ago and i was so absolutely absorbed in this film. My friends felt the same way i did and we all sat on the same couch with the lights off while this film quietly terrified us!\n\nNow I'm not exactly a huge horror movie enthusiast as i find most horror films to be stupid, cheesy and just not scary in the slightest. Horror films now are especially ridiculous as that "Saw" series (when will it end?) is just silly and repetitive which is a shame as the first film is a pretty descent thriller, which seems to be another problem for horror films is that there are too many sequels with each film becoming further and further detached from the original making the whole premise and idea of the film pointless and boring.\n\nWhich is exactly the reason "Event Horizon" works. It is a stand-alone film. No sequels. No actual killer as such...it is the presence of an unseen evil which corrupts the characters into becoming warped and ultimately the cause of their own demise. For a horror film the kill count is surprisingly low and no one actually dies during the first hour of the film. It's the suspense of the film and the actual idea behind it which is so un-believable frightening that you find yourself absorbed and un-able to look away from the screen....gripped in fear. That's why this film is so brilliant. The cast is great. It's not overly convoluted. It's scary beyond belief. The story is good enough to keep the viewers attention and adrenaline pumping and the special effects have held up surprisingly well for a film that was filmed back in 1997.\n\nI really wish there was a Director's cut edition of this film.\n\nIf you've seen this film and you were not frightened...you are either really warped, lying, or talked all the way through it. i suggest a re-watch by yourself with the lights off and all other distractions (laptop, cellphone) switched off as well and just sit and watch...I guarantee fear will gnaw at you eventually.\n\nAnd if you enjoyed this film, you should also check out "Pandorum" as it is also fairly good, though not quite in the same league as "Event Horizon".\n\n"Liberate tutame...ex inferis."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I loved it!!! Now 12 years later a finally purchase the film on DVD (ordered from the states as I can't find it anywhere in New Zealand) and I watched it with a couple friends who have never seen it before. Suddenly I was 14 again! A scared child, too frightened to look away from the screen. Caught in an icy grip of fear and excitement! A feeling I haven't felt since the first viewing of 'Event Horizon'. Brilliant! I jumped in all the same scenes I jumped in 12 years ago and i was so absolutely absorbed in this film. My friends felt the same way i did and we all sat on the same couch with the lights off while this film quietly terrified us!\n\nNow I'm not exactly a huge horror movie enthusiast as i find most horror films to be stupid, cheesy and just not scary in the slightest. Horror films now are especially ridiculous as that "Saw" series (when will it end?) is just silly and repetitive which is a shame as the first film is a pretty descent thriller, which seems to be another problem for horror films is that there are too many sequels with each film becoming further and further detached from the original making the whole premise and idea of the film pointless and boring.\n\nWhich is exactly the reason "Event Horizon" works. It is a stand-alone film. No sequels. No actual killer as such...it is the presence of an unseen evil which corrupts the characters into becoming warped and ultimately the cause of their own demise. For a horror film the kill count is surprisingly low and no one actually dies during the first hour of the film. It's the suspense of the film and the actual idea behind it which is so un-believable frightening that you find yourself absorbed and un-able to look away from the screen....gripped in fear. That's why this film is so brilliant. The cast is great. It's not overly convoluted. It's scary beyond belief. The story is good enough to keep the viewers attention and adrenaline pumping and the special effects have held up surprisingly well for a film that was filmed back in 1997.\n\nI really wish there was a Director's cut edition of this film.\n\nIf you've seen this film and you were not frightened...you are either really warped, lying, or talked all the way through it. i suggest a re-watch by yourself with the lights off and all other distractions (laptop, cellphone) switched off as well and just sit and watch...I guarantee fear will gnaw at you eventually.\n\nAnd if you enjoyed this film, you should also check out "Pandorum" as it is also fairly good, though not quite in the same league as "Event Horizon".\n\n"Liberate tutame...ex inferis."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.\n\nAs I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.\n\nThis movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.\n\nThis film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.\n\nEven though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.\n\nMy Grade: A-","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":300546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.\n\nAs I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.\n\nThis movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.\n\nThis film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.\n\nEven though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.\n\nMy Grade: A-","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":300546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ono što je trebalo biti izlet oca i kćeri postaje iskustvo koje će im otvoriti oči i neočekivano putovanje obmane. Eva (8 godina) i njezin otac putuju iz Montréala do Meksika u velikom kamionu s 18 kotača. Emigrirali su u Quebec prije tri godine i, iako bi ona radije letjela avionom, Eva je vrlo uzbuđena što je na prvom dopustu s ocem.</desc>

Two stunningly shocking scenes occur in the first fifteen minutes of this film to set the tone of oppression and repression.\n\nTwo men, secret lovers, go on a trip through Siberia to visit a sick relative. The scenery, while wild and beautiful, does nothing to lessen the pervasive sense of doom of the film - it festers with ruined villages, depopulated industrial units, half-witted villagers too deprived to have moved, widows eking out an existence. It's a metaphor for the poison that has been instilled into the minds of these two men. What they have is beautiful like the landscape, but it is riddled with decay and hopelessness.\n\nThe denouement, when it comes, is shocking in its suddenness. The epilogue to this is just as dreadfully hard to watch.\n\nI was riveted throughout. The dialogue was to the point, alien to someone brought up in the milieu of cosmopolitan London despite homosexuality being forbidden during my formative years, but atrociously fascinating. The persecution shown in this film was of a different order from what went on in my youth. We had the swinging sixties, at least. Here in Siberia there is no relief even in an escape to a big city.\n\nI certainly recommend this film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":227,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Two stunningly shocking scenes occur in the first fifteen minutes of this film to set the tone of oppression and repression.\n\nTwo men, secret lovers, go on a trip through Siberia to visit a sick relative. The scenery, while wild and beautiful, does nothing to lessen the pervasive sense of doom of the film - it festers with ruined villages, depopulated industrial units, half-witted villagers too deprived to have moved, widows eking out an existence. It's a metaphor for the poison that has been instilled into the minds of these two men. What they have is beautiful like the landscape, but it is riddled with decay and hopelessness.\n\nThe denouement, when it comes, is shocking in its suddenness. The epilogue to this is just as dreadfully hard to watch.\n\nI was riveted throughout. The dialogue was to the point, alien to someone brought up in the milieu of cosmopolitan London despite homosexuality being forbidden during my formative years, but atrociously fascinating. The persecution shown in this film was of a different order from what went on in my youth. We had the swinging sixties, at least. Here in Siberia there is no relief even in an escape to a big city.\n\nI certainly recommend this film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":227,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Fragile humans experience life and death, joy and despair in the face of its power."},"datePublished":"2019-12-12","description":"Water and ice are shown around the world, in all of their many powerful forms.","keywords":"very little dialogue,water,ice,nature,boat","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt4920360/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"nehpetstephen"},"dateCreated":"2019-12-27","inLanguage":"English","name":"Aesthetic recklessness","reviewBody":"This film tries to overwhelm with the sublimity of nature, but the sublime is ultimately an enfeebling, passive experience, and what the world doesn't need right now is another passive art film.\n\nAQUARELA is ostensibly about climate change and how that will influence humanity--but what that effect is and how we should respond to it essentially boils down to one giant shrug by the time the film ends.\n\nThis isn't true of the film's opening scenes in Russia, which are entrancing and devastating. In the opening, with its scarce dialogue, the viewer gradually realizes that a rescue team must work full time to save people and vehicles from the ice. Normally, this ice would be frozen a full three weeks longer, allowing people to drive across it as a shortcut. These routines are interrupted, however, by the changing climate, and the rather brutal impact of that abrupt change is captured on camera. The opening scenes capture the truth of this global moment: that the world is changing quickly, that those changes have already begun to be devastating to certain human and nonhuman communities, and that those changes are going to continue to get worse and have increasingly miserable effects if major remediation does not begin immediately.\n\nOnce those opening scenes are over, however, the film devolves into narrative-free splendor--to very poor effect. Greenland glaciers crumble to heavy metal music. A woman in a boat does... something amidst heavy waves. Dolphins frolic, hunting for prey. People cower in a cave during a downpour. A Miami hurricane empties out the streets and whips palm trees into a frenzy. And Angel Falls in Venezuela dissolves into mist and rainbows.\n\nThis is all gorgeous, yes, and the music is pretty cool, but the overall effect of this decontextualized music video is to force viewers into a simple acceptance that nature is powerful and cool and beautiful. If one is of a Judeo-Christian background, then the rainbow at the end cannot help but remind one of the covenant made after Noah's Flood--that God will never again destroy the Earth by water. Does that mean our bases are covered, then? Are we in the clear? Is there nothing to worry about?\n\nSublimity in art is the presentation of massive, jaw-dropping splendor. The viewer cannot respond except with trembling awe and respect. (Given the hydro themes of the film, I'm reminded of the process of sublimation, when solid ice is exposed to a force so hot that it instantly converts to gaseous steam without first passing through the intermediate liquid phase. The sublime sublimates us--turns our minds from thoughts of this solid, material earth to matters of pure spirit.) The sublime is an entrancing experience, but its antithetical to any actual thought or action. With the sublime, we are told that our puny lives are inconsequential against the grand innerworkings of the cosmos. Like Job quaking before the Leviathan, we must accept that we cannot fathom the truth of things and so we should simply stick to smaller concerns.\n\nAll that may be so, but such a mindset masks the extent to which human systems, human choices, human lifestyles, human actions have played an enormous role in causing our present environmental crisis. A sublime worldview, like the one this film presents, not only masks that culpability--in doing so, it absolves us of all guilt and excuses us from not bothering to come up with solutions.\n\nHumanity will one day probably cease to exist, but life will still continue to thrive, and the Earth will remain a fearsome and majestic place.

Mountains of ice move and break apart as if they had a life of their own. Viktor Kossakovsky's film travels the world, from the precarious frozen waters of Russia's Lake Baikal and Miami in the throes of Hurricane Irma, to Venezuela's mighty Angel Falls in order to paint a portrait of this fluid life force in all its glorious forms. Fragile humans experience life and death, joy and despair in the face of its power.","datePublished":"2019-12-12","description":"Water and ice are shown around the world, in all of their many powerful forms.","keywords":"very little dialogue,water,ice,nature,boat","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt4920360/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"nehpetstephen","dateCreated":"2019-12-27","inLanguage":"English","name":"Aesthetic recklessness","reviewBody":"This film tries to overwhelm with the sublimity of nature, but the sublime is ultimately an enfeebling, passive experience, and what the world doesn't need right now is another passive art film.\n\nAQUARELA is ostensibly about climate change and how that will influence humanity--but what that effect is and how we should respond to it essentially boils down to one giant shrug by the time the film ends.\n\nThis isn't true of the film's opening scenes in Russia, which are entrancing and devastating. In the opening, with its scarce dialogue, the viewer gradually realizes that a rescue team must work full time to save people and vehicles from the ice. Normally, this ice would be frozen a full three weeks longer, allowing people to drive across it as a shortcut. These routines are interrupted, however, by the changing climate, and the rather brutal impact of that abrupt change is captured on camera. The opening scenes capture the truth of this global moment: that the world is changing quickly, that those changes have already begun to be devastating to certain human and nonhuman communities, and that those changes are going to continue to get worse and have increasingly miserable effects if major remediation does not begin immediately.\n\nOnce those opening scenes are over, however, the film devolves into narrative-free splendor--to very poor effect. Greenland glaciers crumble to heavy metal music. A woman in a boat does... something amidst heavy waves. Dolphins frolic, hunting for prey. People cower in a cave during a downpour. A Miami hurricane empties out the streets and whips palm trees into a frenzy. And Angel Falls in Venezuela dissolves into mist and rainbows.\n\nThis is all gorgeous, yes, and the music is pretty cool, but the overall effect of this decontextualized music video is to force viewers into a simple acceptance that nature is powerful and cool and beautiful. If one is of a Judeo-Christian background, then the rainbow at the end cannot help but remind one of the covenant made after Noah's Flood--that God will never again destroy the Earth by water. Does that mean our bases are covered, then? Are we in the clear? Is there nothing to worry about?\n\nSublimity in art is the presentation of massive, jaw-dropping splendor. The viewer cannot respond except with trembling awe and respect. (Given the hydro themes of the film, I'm reminded of the process of sublimation, when solid ice is exposed to a force so hot that it instantly converts to gaseous steam without first passing through the intermediate liquid phase. The sublime sublimates us--turns our minds from thoughts of this solid, material earth to matters of pure spirit.) The sublime is an entrancing experience, but its antithetical to any actual thought or action. With the sublime, we are told that our puny lives are inconsequential against the grand innerworkings of the cosmos. Like Job quaking before the Leviathan, we must accept that we cannot fathom the truth of things and so we should simply stick to smaller concerns.\n\nAll that may be so, but such a mindset masks the extent to which human systems, human choices, human lifestyles, human actions have played an enormous role in causing our present environmental crisis. A sublime worldview, like the one this film presents, not only masks that culpability--in doing so, it absolves us of all guilt and excuses us from not bothering to come up with solutions.\n\nHumanity will one day probably cease to exist, but life will still continue to thrive, and the Earth will remain a fearsome and majestic place. Perhaps the film wants to decenter us from our anthropocentric concerns and force us to view the wonders of nature from a broader geologic scale. The hurricane scene in Miami may be bereft of any human presence, but the herons look like they're doing just fine, and I'm sure the gators are having the time of their lives.\n\nAt this point in time, however--a point when humans have already set in motion these catastrophic changes yet all hope is not yet quite lost--it seems a little dangerous to be abandoning oneself to such nihilism without sufficiently attending to the immense cost--both human and non-human--that such change is bringing about.

It didn't seem like real people to me until I realised that yes, sometimes young immature people behave and talk like that (I'm 23). They scream and make assumptions and have trust issues. They are egotistic, overly jealous and completely ridiculous in how they act in their relationships. I mean they truly think that this is what real love is and feels like. If your significant other isn't toxic and doesn't make you cry 80% of the time then are you even in love? And then one day you grow up and realise that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood. You never search for the knife in your back because it's not there. Sometimes real relationships are so good they get boring and that's okay. Of course there are always hardships but they don't look remotely like the ones in this movie. Let me be clear. HARDIN AND TESSA SHOULD NOT BE TOGETHER. At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other. The trust is not there and they keep hurting each other. They retaliate and purposely try to hurt one another. I hope young people seeing this don't mistaken this for what it isn't. On the other hand who hasn't made mistakes regarding their love life. So I guess at the end of the day you should do you. Moving forward to the actual movie.. it's even worse. The dialogues, man, the dialogues. The direction makes me want to cry(not in a good way). I really think that many problems with the movie had to do with the problematic writing state that the books are in. Bad material can only get better to a certain point. If I were 14 I might have likes this movie. But I'm not.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It didn't seem like real people to me until I realised that yes, sometimes young immature people behave and talk like that (I'm 23). They scream and make assumptions and have trust issues. They are egotistic, overly jealous and completely ridiculous in how they act in their relationships. I mean they truly think that this is what real love is and feels like. If your significant other isn't toxic and doesn't make you cry 80% of the time then are you even in love? And then one day you grow up and realise that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood. You never search for the knife in your back because it's not there. Sometimes real relationships are so good they get boring and that's okay. Of course there are always hardships but they don't look remotely like the ones in this movie. Let me be clear. HARDIN AND TESSA SHOULD NOT BE TOGETHER. At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other. The trust is not there and they keep hurting each other. They retaliate and purposely try to hurt one another. I hope young people seeing this don't mistaken this for what it isn't. On the other hand who hasn't made mistakes regarding their love life. So I guess at the end of the day you should do you. Moving forward to the actual movie.. it's even worse. The dialogues, man, the dialogues. The direction makes me want to cry(not in a good way). I really think that many problems with the movie had to do with the problematic writing state that the books are in. Bad material can only get better to a certain point. If I were 14 I might have likes this movie. But I'm not.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They are egotistic, overly jealous and completely ridiculous in how they act in their relationships. I mean they truly think that this is what real love is and feels like. If your significant other isn't toxic and doesn't make you cry 80% of the time then are you even in love? And then one day you grow up and realise that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood. You never search for the knife in your back because it's not there. Sometimes real relationships are so good they get boring and that's okay. Of course there are always hardships but they don't look remotely like the ones in this movie. Let me be clear. HARDIN AND TESSA SHOULD NOT BE TOGETHER. At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other. The trust is not there and they keep hurting each other. They retaliate and purposely try to hurt one another. I hope young people seeing this don't mistaken this for what it isn't. On the other hand who hasn't made mistakes regarding their love life. So I guess at the end of the day you should do you. Moving forward to the actual movie.. it's even worse. The dialogues, man, the dialogues. The direction makes me want to cry(not in a good way). I really think that many problems with the movie had to do with the problematic writing state that the books are in. Bad material can only get better to a certain point. If I were 14 I might have likes this movie. But I'm not.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The characters are all so real, and deviate exceptionally from the standard roster of character archetypes in these sorts of films and shows. It's funny, because I never noticed how ubiquitous certain personality tropes are in this genre until watching this movie that defies the standards and is actually quite original.\n\nBonnie and the magpie are the best characters. Fight me. But everyone is pretty splendid in their own ways.\n\nI do wish they didn't feel the need to endorse tobacco cigarettes at the end.

Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take.  I can though.  But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris.  And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house.  But not without the climax.  While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl.  Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best.

Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take.  I can though.  But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris.  And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house.  But not without the climax.  While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl.  Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best.

Furthermore, being presented as a comedy makes it even better (there are a lot of very funny moments in which I couldn't stop laughing) but unfortunately it lacks a bit of complexity making it often predictable which somehow spoils the enthusiasm, not to mention the ending which is rushed and comes "out of nowhere".

Most 80s comedies were full of slapstick moments. Jamie Lee Curtis was at the height of her sexy image and I'd forgotten how well she'd played her role. The late Don Ameche is so animated that it played perfectly into the mood of the film.\n\nYou can find this film in the bargain bin of most stores these days. I saw it for sale for only $5.50. It's worth owning.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140461,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

David and Diana are basic but the real failing is in Gage; he should be a rather sinister figure who plays with people like he plays with his money but instead he is just a twinkling eye and a sly smile  in fact, he is Robert Redford. This is part of the problem because, although the material is weak, the cast cannot do anything to improve the situation. Redford is far too smooth and playboyish to really convince in the main role  he cannot tap into any darkness or complexity and his failing is just one of the film's failings. Moore doesn't help either with a basic role where she doesn't seem to understand what her character is supposed to be feeling and therefore cannot convince in many of her scenes. Meanwhile Harrelson puffs and blows on cue but adds little. The support cast features turns from Platt, Cassel, Connelly and Thornton but aside from being recognisable faces they don't add much. Lyne directs with typical glossy style but he has no clue how to get deeper into the characters and story so instead just throws in lots of exploitative but empty scenes in the hope of somehow emotionally engaging his audience.\n\nOverall this is not an awful film but it is so superficial and hollow that it is just bland and glossy. It only is made worse when you think of the potential it had to be a complex and insightful modern morally piece.

The trailer for the film admittedly didn't do much for me, but I was intrigued by the concept of a female-driven Apatow film. Ultimately, I went into the theater with modest expectations, hoping to get a few good laughs out of it.\n\nBy the time we came out of the theater, my three friends and I had smiles plastered across our faces, and we couldn't stop talking about the film for the next couple hours. We all loved it. I think it easily ranks with the best of the Apatow productions, and it might even be my personal favorite. Like all of Apatow's productions, there are admittedly scenes that arguably go a little too far or a little too long, but that's a small criticism when the film successfully fires on so many other cylinders.\n\nTo start with, the film is hilarious, and I think the comedy far exceeds the standalone bits shown in the trailer. Scene after scene is filled with humorous and often sidesplitting moments, and they had the theater in an uproar during the screening. I can't say enough about Kristen Wiig. Prior to this, I've always liked her to some extent but never really loved her. I think she's good at what she does, but I wasn't sure her shtick could sustain an entire film. Would her passive aggressive wit get old? Is it the only note she can play? Can she handle anything more dramatic? Ultimately, she blew me away in this film. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny, but her character is surprisingly well-developed, and Wiig brings the character to vibrant and dynamic life on-screen.\n\nAnd this brings me to my next point about Bridesmaids: the film has a surprising amount of depth that completely caught me off guard. Bridesmaids isn't a quickie 80-minute gag fest by any stretch of the imagination; it's actually a leisurely paced 2-hour character-driven comedy that takes time to develop its characters and establish the various relationships and resultant conflicts between them. Ultimately, the film ends up being quite heartfelt and even rather sad in places. Despite the over-the-top antics shown in the trailer, the themes that the film explores are actually quite grounded. Kristen Wiig's character is someone who is feeling completely let down by life, which is a place we've all been, and the personal journey of her character resonated strongly for me. While her character is easily the most well-developed of the bunch, even the other bridesmaids ultimately show some three-dimensionality as well, despite the fact that they are sometimes initially introduced as two-dimensional caricatures.\n\nUltimately, Bridesmaids was one of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen in a long time. It's certainly not perfect: it could probably do with some editing, there might be a few too many subplots (some of which are left unexplored), and it arguably goes too over-the-top at times, but everything else about the film works so well that these complaints are little more than nitpicks. While I applaud everyone involved in the production, it is Kristen Wiig who deserves the most accolades. As co-writer and lead actress, she plays a huge part in the film's success, and I sincerely hope this film puts her on the Hollywood map, as I would love to see more from her in the future. Whatever the case may be, Bridesmaids certainly makes for a successful maiden voyage for her into the world of feature-film comedies.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":273810,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The trailer for the film admittedly didn't do much for me, but I was intrigued by the concept of a female-driven Apatow film. Ultimately, I went into the theater with modest expectations, hoping to get a few good laughs out of it.\n\nBy the time we came out of the theater, my three friends and I had smiles plastered across our faces, and we couldn't stop talking about the film for the next couple hours. We all loved it. I think it easily ranks with the best of the Apatow productions, and it might even be my personal favorite. Like all of Apatow's productions, there are admittedly scenes that arguably go a little too far or a little too long, but that's a small criticism when the film successfully fires on so many other cylinders.\n\nTo start with, the film is hilarious, and I think the comedy far exceeds the standalone bits shown in the trailer. Scene after scene is filled with humorous and often sidesplitting moments, and they had the theater in an uproar during the screening. I can't say enough about Kristen Wiig. Prior to this, I've always liked her to some extent but never really loved her. I think she's good at what she does, but I wasn't sure her shtick could sustain an entire film. Would her passive aggressive wit get old? Is it the only note she can play? Can she handle anything more dramatic? Ultimately, she blew me away in this film. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny, but her character is surprisingly well-developed, and Wiig brings the character to vibrant and dynamic life on-screen.\n\nAnd this brings me to my next point about Bridesmaids: the film has a surprising amount of depth that completely caught me off guard. Bridesmaids isn't a quickie 80-minute gag fest by any stretch of the imagination; it's actually a leisurely paced 2-hour character-driven comedy that takes time to develop its characters and establish the various relationships and resultant conflicts between them. Ultimately, the film ends up being quite heartfelt and even rather sad in places. Despite the over-the-top antics shown in the trailer, the themes that the film explores are actually quite grounded. Kristen Wiig's character is someone who is feeling completely let down by life, which is a place we've all been, and the personal journey of her character resonated strongly for me. While her character is easily the most well-developed of the bunch, even the other bridesmaids ultimately show some three-dimensionality as well, despite the fact that they are sometimes initially introduced as two-dimensional caricatures.\n\nUltimately, Bridesmaids was one of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen in a long time. It's certainly not perfect: it could probably do with some editing, there might be a few too many subplots (some of which are left unexplored), and it arguably goes too over-the-top at times, but everything else about the film works so well that these complaints are little more than nitpicks. While I applaud everyone involved in the production, it is Kristen Wiig who deserves the most accolades.

Many of his films, mostly produced by Markus Selin of Solar Films, have achieved great popularity and often feature the most famous Finnish actors in lead roles. My own favourite of Mäkelä's work is probably The Tough Ones (1999), but his latest crime drama Rööperi is very watchable as well, an opinion shared by the common public (the film was the most watched domestic movie in its year of release).\n\nThe story is loosely based on a non-fiction book about the life of a former criminal Tom Sjöberg. At the beginning in 1966, Tomppa (Samuli Edelmann) and his friends Krisu and Kari (Peter Franzén and Kari Hietalahti) are getting fed up with the small scale of their illegal liquor selling business in Punavuori, Helsinki ("Rööperi" of the title). With hard fists and even harder attitudes they expand their territories and make more money, but are also aware that their criminal lifestyle can only have three different outcomes: going straight, prison or death. Tomppa is the most responsible of the bunch and opens a sex shop to earn a (somewhat) honest living for himself and his wife Monika (Pihla Viitala), while Kari cannot really get a grip on life after losing his mother. Krisu, in turn, becomes involved in drug trading with devastating consequences.\n\nMarkus Selin productions have always had an "international" feel to them, meaning that they have spent good money to make the films look professional and that the production values are decent. Rööperi is not an exception; the Helsinki of the 1960s and 70s looks very stylish, largely thanks to the experienced cinematographer Pini Hellstedt. Especially the streets in the menacing opening scene bask in beautiful green light and many of the shady interiors are handsomely shadowy. Certain camera angles and movements are also showier than in average Finnish movies, but luckily do not cross the border into annoying, distracting trickery.\n\nThe core of the film, the story, is fairly interesting too. The very spine of the plot is Tomppa's development from a street thug to an increasingly honest businessman despite personal tragedies and his feelings of responsibility regarding his wife and friends who just cannot see where their lives are heading at until it is already too late. Tomppa is very nicely portrayed by the charismatic singer-actor Samuli Edelmann, but Kari Hietalahti and Peter Franzén don't fall behind one bit in their roles of Kari and Krisu respectively – the latter's performance as the miserable junkie actually belongs among the best I have seen in any recent Finnish film. The supporting actors do good work as well, particularly Pekka Valkeejärvi as the brutal rivaling criminal Uki and Juha Veijonen as the fatherly police lieutenant Koistinen. The one exception would be the way too young-looking Jasper Pääkkönen in the role of the mobster Korppu: he makes without a doubt the least convincing gangster boss I have ever seen in any movie.\n\nIn spite of the mostly great acting and carefully created visuals, some things hold Rööperi back from being a really great film. For one thing, I feel the use of music is often too openly manipulative, even corny. The presumably exaggerated badassness of the antagonists Uki and Korppu does not always ring true and evokes feelings of style over substance at points, but on the other hand it is good that Finnish cinema is not always so afraid of stylization and flair. In any case, Tomppa's story is worth telling with or without flashiness and the movie never feels boring despite the 120+ minute runtime. The first time I saw it at the theater I didn't care for Rööperi much, but after a rewatch on DVD it started seeming a lot more dramatic and interesting than before. Perhaps a less tough, more low-key approach could have improved the movie, but I like it as it is now as well.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3276,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati.

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Vrijeme prvih televizora, igranki, epoha šlagera i rock and roll-a, duh i specifičan način života Banjaluke su okvirna tema serijala. Romantično ljubavna komedija "To toplo ljeto" serija je koja se sa osmijehom i sjećanjem posvetila Banjaluci i po mnogo čemu značajnoj i prelomnoj, 1968. godini. Vrijeme prvih televizora, igranki, epoha šlagera i rock and roll-a, duh i specifičan način života Banjaluke su okvirna tema serijala. U deset epizoda prati priču o lijepoj Anki i nadmetanju nekoliko, po svemu različitih ljudi koji se bore za njenu ljubav. Paralelne priče o nekoliko porodica utkanih u mentalitet Banjaluke i vremenski kontekst kraja šezdesetih godina čine dramaturšku fresku koja je namijenjena svim uzrastima i svim profilima gledalaca. Projekat je nastao u koprodukciji Radio-televizije Republike Srpske, Pink Internacional Company i MM Production, pod pokroviteljstvom Vlade RS i Grada Banja Luka.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

Na različit način u njihovom životu i životima ljudi koji ih okružuju, prelamaju se i njihove frustracije iz djetinjstva: odlaskom njihove majke Karoline kad je Vanji bilo 11, Matiji 7, a Saši su tada bile 3 godine. Susrećemo ih u trenutku kad svaka ima svoj samostalan život.Nakon Karolininog odlaska, najstarija sestra Vanja odigrala je "majčinsku figuru" u obitelji. Vodi restoran zajedno s najboljom prijateljicom Tamarom, dokljubavnu vezu održava s mladim instruktorom joge, Robertom, koji iz propalog braka ima maloljetnog sina Vedrana.Najemotivnija sestra Matija, u braku je s Lukom Draganom, sinom Ante Dragana, jednog od najuspješnijih auto-zastupnika u Hrvatskoj. Luka, kao i njegov brat Pavle rade za oca u Autokući Dragan.Najmlađa sestra Saša je diplomirala na Medicinskom fakultetu te je počela raditi na zagrebačkoj Peščenici. U vezi je s Slavenom, također budućim doktorom, kojeg je tokom cijelog fakulteta tetošila i pomagala mu da stekne doktorsku diplomu, a on joj je to sve vratio jednom prevarom, za koju i sama Saša ubrzo sazna. Iste noći, upušta se u seksualni odnos s nepoznatim muškarcem. Uskoro, Saša saznaje kako je trudna. No pitanje je : tko je otac?Majka koja ih je napustila, Karolina, upravo dobiva veliku glumačku šansu: ulogu žene svog bivšeg supruga i oca triju sestara, Ivice u obnovljenoj seriji koja je njemu donijela slavu. Karolina se vraća u njihove živote, što sestre ne ostavlja ravnodušnima, a bogme ni samog Ivicu, u kojeg se pak zaljubi mnogo mlađa kolegica Ema Knez.</desc>

Osnivač i vlasnik firme je Spiridon Don Karamarković, nekadašnji pripadnik Legije stranaca, ekspert za sva pitanja i najškrtiji gazda na svetu. Deda mu je rekao da svaki uspešan Srbin mora da ima kafanu i on je ove godine osnovao svoju. Poslove oko kafane poverio je misterioznoj Madam Žaklini koja je naše gore list, ali je ugostiteljsko znanje sticala u Parizu.</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Tom Cruise reprises the role of Ethan Hunt, IMF agent extraordinaire who is attempting to leave the IMF field work to others as he takes over training of new agents. Can he stand it? Of course not! or the movie would've ended in 10 minutes!\n\nHe's engaged to marry Michelle Monaghan as his fiancée Julia. I think their chemistry was pretty good. I recently watched her in Source Code and she's a terrific actress. At an engagement party, Ethan gets a call and next thing you know, he's back in the field. He just has that itch and needs to scratch it. Cruise does a decent acting job of a guy torn between two worlds, where he wants to be just another normal guy, but his whole team is telling him that he can't have a normal life. \n\nHis team delivers, particularly Ving Rhames, who is so Mr. Cool. Also Maggie Q has a unique ability to blend in as nobody special, but be made to be very sexy when needed. Jonathan Rhyss Myers was standard. I saw him in Bend it Like Beckham, and he's OK as an actor. Laurence Fishburne delivers as a mega boss type guy who takes no crap or bs from anyone. And finally Billy Crudup as Cruise's mission chief who aids and abets Cruise outside the authority of officialdom. \n\nThe plot is pretty simple, good guys against bad guys. Phillipe S. Hoffman absolutely delivers as evil, sadistic, feelingless arms dealer Owen Davian, who sells anything to anyone for a price with no concern about anyone. Hoffman, RIP, has some tremendous scenes with Cruise, where they go toe to toe in life or death struggles. Whoa, those scenes are really intense emotionally and physically.\n\nThe action spans the globe from the US to Germany to Italy to China and back. At a little over 2 hours, the film is nicely paced. There are no real down moments where you feel the movie drags - it's non-stop. At the end, you don't really care about the Rabbit's Foot as much as you do about how it's going to go down. Just strap yourself in and enjoy this fine installment to the MI series.

Tom Cruise reprises the role of Ethan Hunt, IMF agent extraordinaire who is attempting to leave the IMF field work to others as he takes over training of new agents. Can he stand it? Of course not! or the movie would've ended in 10 minutes!\n\nHe's engaged to marry Michelle Monaghan as his fiancée Julia. I think their chemistry was pretty good. I recently watched her in Source Code and she's a terrific actress. At an engagement party, Ethan gets a call and next thing you know, he's back in the field. He just has that itch and needs to scratch it. Cruise does a decent acting job of a guy torn between two worlds, where he wants to be just another normal guy, but his whole team is telling him that he can't have a normal life. \n\nHis team delivers, particularly Ving Rhames, who is so Mr. Cool. Also Maggie Q has a unique ability to blend in as nobody special, but be made to be very sexy when needed. Jonathan Rhyss Myers was standard. I saw him in Bend it Like Beckham, and he's OK as an actor. Laurence Fishburne delivers as a mega boss type guy who takes no crap or bs from anyone. And finally Billy Crudup as Cruise's mission chief who aids and abets Cruise outside the authority of officialdom. \n\nThe plot is pretty simple, good guys against bad guys. Phillipe S. Hoffman absolutely delivers as evil, sadistic, feelingless arms dealer Owen Davian, who sells anything to anyone for a price with no concern about anyone. Hoffman, RIP, has some tremendous scenes with Cruise, where they go toe to toe in life or death struggles. Whoa, those scenes are really intense emotionally and physically.\n\nThe action spans the globe from the US to Germany to Italy to China and back. At a little over 2 hours, the film is nicely paced. There are no real down moments where you feel the movie drags - it's non-stop. At the end, you don't really care about the Rabbit's Foot as much as you do about how it's going to go down. Just strap yourself in and enjoy this fine installment to the MI series. Enjoy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":335050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Each character is extremely well acted and leaves the viewer understanding them, and feeling deeply for them. As the film progresses, we are moving with them in their situations,and begin to understand why we all do things that seem to be just not the way we thought they would go. The scenery and setting all tell the story beautifully, and the ending is brought together perfectly to leave us with a feeling of everything can be whatever we can make it to be. Sadness, guilt, relief, all the feelings we all experience every day. All brought together wonderfully in this great film. This is one of those films that makes us remember what it was like to be a child, what we became as adults, as we learned to judge ourselves and others, how it is to see loved ones hurt and to feel loss. I was greatly surprised by everyone in this film, because I initially watched it because I admire Juliette Lewis, and she is tremendous in this film, but everyone else matches her. This is one of those films that stays with you, and makes you want to watch it over and over.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":686,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Each character is extremely well acted and leaves the viewer understanding them, and feeling deeply for them. As the film progresses, we are moving with them in their situations,and begin to understand why we all do things that seem to be just not the way we thought they would go. The scenery and setting all tell the story beautifully, and the ending is brought together perfectly to leave us with a feeling of everything can be whatever we can make it to be. Sadness, guilt, relief, all the feelings we all experience every day. All brought together wonderfully in this great film. This is one of those films that makes us remember what it was like to be a child, what we became as adults, as we learned to judge ourselves and others, how it is to see loved ones hurt and to feel loss. I was greatly surprised by everyone in this film, because I initially watched it because I admire Juliette Lewis, and she is tremendous in this film, but everyone else matches her. This is one of those films that stays with you, and makes you want to watch it over and over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":686,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's been over three weeks since my screening of Steven Spielberg's emotionally harrowing epic about a robot boy.  Before writing my review, I wanted to let its themes, content, and characters sink into my head and make a solid impact. The film was based on an idea by Stanley Kubrick, but when he died in 1999, Speilberg took charge of the project. I could spend pages discussing the techniques of Kubrick's intentions and Spielberg's decisions, but I will not. Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg are two of the greatest directors American cinema has to offer; it's pure pleasure watching their ideas clash and flow.\t I am not going to examine each individual theme here, either. That would ruin the movie for you. \n\n"AI - Artificial Intelligence" presents many themes on screen, but it's important to take what you get out of it. Whenever I read a review of Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" or "2001: A Space Odyssey" I feel influenced by the reviewer's interpretation of the movie's themes. Every time I watch either of those movies I get something new out of it. I hate it when other critics state the movie's themes on paper as if it's a fact. There is far too much room for interpretation to reveal this movie's message, or the message of any Kubrick film for that matter. Ask 100 people, and you might get 100 different answers. "AI - Artificial Intelligence" is that kind of movie-one of the year's best.\n\nCritics and audiences alike have torn apart this movie's ending-a clear miscalculation by Spielberg. If Kubrick were in charge, the movie would have called it quits about twenty minutes earlier in an unsettling sequence that takes place in the ocean. But Speilberg, who always seems entranced by science fiction, injects an additional segment into the mix that does not work quite as well, but isn't so completely awful that it deserves such harsh criticism. It still leaves us with an open, startled emotional disorientation. I left the theater with tears in my eyes. The movie before the conclusion is so complex, moving, and involving in so many different ways the last twenty minutes didn't even come close to spoiling the movie for me.\n\n\t"AI" transpires sometime in the near future after the polar ice caps have melted and flooded coastal cities and reduced natural resources. Mechanical androids have become popular since they require no commodities. Reproduction has also become highly illegal. Machines provide sexual services and if anyone wants a child, they will purchase a robot. However, the difference between a robot child and a living child is that robots cannot love. That's the task professor Hobby (William Hurt) of Cybertronics Manufacturing has solved. He has made a robot child that can love. \n\n\tWe can separate "AI" into two separate segments.  I do not want to reveal too much about each plot because the pleasure of watching this movie evolves from the revealing of the connecting plots. I will, however, briefly say the first details a robot child's interaction within a family, and the second deals with the robot's estrangement from its family and the quest to regain the mother's love. \n\nI can imagine the material in Kubrick's hands. The movie's opening scene has a female robot begin to undress in a public office. Speilberg cuts the action before she reveals any explicit nudity. Kubrick would have had various shots of full frontal nudity. Spielberg, never comfortable with sexual material, leaves out much of the motivation behind Kubrick's ideas. One of the biggest problems in "AI" is the lack of edge with the sexual content. Jude Law plays a robot gigolo who lives in a sex fantasy called Rouge City where people from everywhere come to seek sexual satisfaction. The central character, a robot boy played by Haley Joel Osment, motivates every action in the story except for the scenes in Rouge City. Why contain such a perverse character and setting when his entire existence simply displays a mood that has already been well established.  Obvious, the filmmakers toned the aspects of "AI" down to warrant a gutless PG-13 rating-but why? The movie isn't appropriate for children anyway, and it's far too complex. Undoubtedly if Kubrick were in charge "AI" would have to be re-cut to avoid an NC-17 rating. Spielberg should have either taken advantage of the perverse material or completely eliminated it.\n\n \tHere I am, doing exactly what I said that I wouldn't do, and at nearly 900 words, I still have not clearly expressed my own opinions on the film. I have many notes in front of my that display my reaction as I watched the film, but I am not going to use them-they reveal too much about the movie. "AI" is a very personal film, a deeply moving, scientific, careful, and harrowing motion picture that displays startling talent on screen and behind the scenes. The special effects are extraordinary. The performances are alarming-the immensely talented Haley Joel Osment may once again be up for an Academy Award nomination. Go see the movie, then talk about it with others. It's the kind of film that you can spend hours thinking about, then go see it again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":293629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie was right on the money in its portrayal of Northern New Mexico, both in its culture and in its politics. The movie itself is one of the most sublime films I've ever seen in the true sense of the word. It has grandeur of thought, emotion and spirit. It has been bashed in this comment area by those raised on Star Wars, Predator, and the Matrix. To enjoy a movie like TMBW, you have to have a sense of awe, wonder and joy...and a good sense of humor. If you don't, you may get bored. If you do, then you'll find two hours well spent. I obviously love this movie. The music alone will transport you to a pleasant part of your mind, and the absolutely gorgeous New Mexico scenery will make you want to go there to see if it's really real. Try it, you'll like it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5998,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie was right on the money in its portrayal of Northern New Mexico, both in its culture and in its politics. The movie itself is one of the most sublime films I've ever seen in the true sense of the word. It has grandeur of thought, emotion and spirit. It has been bashed in this comment area by those raised on Star Wars, Predator, and the Matrix. To enjoy a movie like TMBW, you have to have a sense of awe, wonder and joy...and a good sense of humor. If you don't, you may get bored. If you do, then you'll find two hours well spent. I obviously love this movie. The music alone will transport you to a pleasant part of your mind, and the absolutely gorgeous New Mexico scenery will make you want to go there to see if it's really real. Try it, you'll like it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5998,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm not convinced he can write anything properly dramatic or serious, but he has proved again and again that he has a wonderful knack for comedy, where his television work on the likes of "Blackadder" and "The Vicar of Dibley" has occasionally outshone his fantastic work on films like "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "The Girl in the Cafe". Curtis is also a good fantasy writer. No, not fantasy in the Lord of the Rings sense, fantasy as done in Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life". "Love Actually" is a beautiful, touching, and genuinely affecting romantic fantasy in which the bits of humor work extremely well.\n\n"Love Actually" works so well as a narrative for several reasons, one of them being that it's fairly unique. The easiest way to describe it would be 'interlocking', but that would sadly put it in the company of trash like Paul Haggis' abortion of a movie "Crash" and Inarritu's similarly unsuccessful "Babel". "Love Actually" is best described as a series of vignettes about various varieties of love.\n\nThe star-studded cast don't exactly have to act their hearts out but they work perfectly together, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy being the most affecting actors in the film. The film is not especially remarkable visually, but it is satisfyingly well-shot. Curtis' script is nothing short of brilliant, at least until the final scenes. If "Love Actually" has flaws, they come in those final scenes. They are certainly contrived, but the rest of the movie does such a good job drawing you in that you barely notice it at the end.

I'm not convinced he can write anything properly dramatic or serious, but he has proved again and again that he has a wonderful knack for comedy, where his television work on the likes of "Blackadder" and "The Vicar of Dibley" has occasionally outshone his fantastic work on films like "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "The Girl in the Cafe". Curtis is also a good fantasy writer. No, not fantasy in the Lord of the Rings sense, fantasy as done in Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life". "Love Actually" is a beautiful, touching, and genuinely affecting romantic fantasy in which the bits of humor work extremely well.\n\n"Love Actually" works so well as a narrative for several reasons, one of them being that it's fairly unique. The easiest way to describe it would be 'interlocking', but that would sadly put it in the company of trash like Paul Haggis' abortion of a movie "Crash" and Inarritu's similarly unsuccessful "Babel". "Love Actually" is best described as a series of vignettes about various varieties of love.\n\nThe star-studded cast don't exactly have to act their hearts out but they work perfectly together, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy being the most affecting actors in the film. The film is not especially remarkable visually, but it is satisfyingly well-shot. Curtis' script is nothing short of brilliant, at least until the final scenes. If "Love Actually" has flaws, they come in those final scenes. They are certainly contrived, but the rest of the movie does such a good job drawing you in that you barely notice it at the end. This is a remarkable film, one that is hard to forget.\n\n9/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Napušta dom i u drugom gradu, okružen prijateljima sklonim veselju, upoznaje novu ženu. Nade da će novi život da protiče bez briga odlaze u nepovrat. I tako akter ove obične životne priče, zabrinut i uznemiren, pokušava, u skladu sa utvrđenim moralnim normama, da spase ustaljeni red stvari: da sačuva porodicu i sinove izvede na "pravi put". Ali, prestup koji je počinio, glad za promenom, dovode ga u bezizlaznu situaciju. Izluđen beznađem, kroz ubistvo, opredeljuje se za patnju kao jedini vid čistote ljudskog trajanja.</desc>

It Doesn't Make Sense " - You're Not Wrong","reviewBody":"This is a remake of a 1980s film where America gets occupied by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Hardly a credible premise but you have to meet it on its own right wing terms . Originally this remake was going to feature an occupation of America by the Chinese . Hardly a credible premise but the fact American films get shown in China nowadays means there's a massive potential market and being worried about losing money the producers then changed the enemy invasion force to the North Koreans . This is where the whole movie collapses from the outset \n\nSome people have defended this film on the grounds that such an invasion could be possible down to the fact that NK has an army of one million people under arms . Indeed it does but this misses out that it lacks any logistical capacity . While amateurs talk tactics professionals talk logistics . NK lacks any force projection . By this I mean it lacks any capacity to invade neighbouring countries . It has no real serviceable navy and even a possible invasion of South Korea would involve hundreds of thousands of troops being transported in either trucks or on foot so any surprise attack on America by NK is laughable . The screenplay does try to get around this unconvincing premise by stating the Koreans have launched an attack by EMP weapons that have destroyed America's communication systems and are are being helped by the Russians though it's never stated why the Russians would be brothers in arms with North Korea \n\nJohn Milius wrote the original RED DAWN as a right wing wish fulfillment . The world has changed beyond all recognition since then so what's the political subtext ? Is there one ? I'm not sure . One of the protagonists is a former veteran of the Iraqi conflict and leading the band of guerrilla fighters he makes the point " When I was abroad we were the good guys because we brought order . Now we're the bad guys because we bring chaos " I fail see the thinking behind this . Order=good , chaos = bad ? How is that then ? Surely it should be democracy good , tyranny bad ? If you're expecting any profound discussion about the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter you're watching the wrong film because the remake of RED DAWN is more concerned about setting up action packed set-pieces where brave Americans kill nasty Asiatic commies \n\nEven then the action scenes collapse when you give them any thought . Don't the North Korean soldiers have things like road blocks where anyone passes through has to be searched for weapons ? There's also a lack of internal continuity . You can guarantee that when the script demands it there's literally thousands of NKs patrolling the streets of the city then when the guerrillas launch an attack there's only a handful of North Koreans who are cannon fodder , then the good guys are back in their camp safe and sound . Why didn't the thousands of communists just head them off in the pass ? \n\nThe original film was bad enough but this one is worse . You can perhaps say this remake has better action scenes but for an action scene to successfully work then there has to still an element of credibility involved and everything about this film lacks any credible element and feels anachronistic in any point it might be making . Indeed in the 1980s American control was criticised in case America became a target of foreign invasion . Try claiming people should be allowed access to guns in case of a sneak attack by North Korea and listen to the laughter","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It Doesn't Make Sense " - You're Not Wrong","reviewBody":"This is a remake of a 1980s film where America gets occupied by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Hardly a credible premise but you have to meet it on its own right wing terms . Originally this remake was going to feature an occupation of America by the Chinese . Hardly a credible premise but the fact American films get shown in China nowadays means there's a massive potential market and being worried about losing money the producers then changed the enemy invasion force to the North Koreans . This is where the whole movie collapses from the outset \n\nSome people have defended this film on the grounds that such an invasion could be possible down to the fact that NK has an army of one million people under arms . Indeed it does but this misses out that it lacks any logistical capacity . While amateurs talk tactics professionals talk logistics . NK lacks any force projection . By this I mean it lacks any capacity to invade neighbouring countries . It has no real serviceable navy and even a possible invasion of South Korea would involve hundreds of thousands of troops being transported in either trucks or on foot so any surprise attack on America by NK is laughable . The screenplay does try to get around this unconvincing premise by stating the Koreans have launched an attack by EMP weapons that have destroyed America's communication systems and are are being helped by the Russians though it's never stated why the Russians would be brothers in arms with North Korea \n\nJohn Milius wrote the original RED DAWN as a right wing wish fulfillment . The world has changed beyond all recognition since then so what's the political subtext ? Is there one ? I'm not sure . One of the protagonists is a former veteran of the Iraqi conflict and leading the band of guerrilla fighters he makes the point " When I was abroad we were the good guys because we brought order . Now we're the bad guys because we bring chaos " I fail see the thinking behind this . Order=good , chaos = bad ? How is that then ? Surely it should be democracy good , tyranny bad ? If you're expecting any profound discussion about the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter you're watching the wrong film because the remake of RED DAWN is more concerned about setting up action packed set-pieces where brave Americans kill nasty Asiatic commies \n\nEven then the action scenes collapse when you give them any thought . Don't the North Korean soldiers have things like road blocks where anyone passes through has to be searched for weapons ? There's also a lack of internal continuity . You can guarantee that when the script demands it there's literally thousands of NKs patrolling the streets of the city then when the guerrillas launch an attack there's only a handful of North Koreans who are cannon fodder , then the good guys are back in their camp safe and sound . Why didn't the thousands of communists just head them off in the pass ? \n\nThe original film was bad enough but this one is worse . You can perhaps say this remake has better action scenes but for an action scene to successfully work then there has to still an element of credibility involved and everything about this film lacks any credible element and feels anachronistic in any point it might be making . Indeed in the 1980s American control was criticised in case America became a target of foreign invasion . Try claiming people should be allowed access to guns in case of a sneak attack by North Korea and listen to the laughter","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like a good painting, his movies tell a story, which much like an abstract painting, is not always easy to figure out. But what a treat it is to try.\n\nBlue Velvet is a story about a young man returning to his hometown to visit his father who is sick in the hospital. Upon his return he stumbles upon a frightening discovery: a human ear lying on the grass as he walks through the forest behind his parents home. He then takes it upon himself to discover where this ear came from and discovers that that ear will be the reason why he discovers that this is in fact a very strange and dangerous world in which we live in.\n\nLynch is synonymous with the strange and unusual and Blue Velvet is a good example of this. For those who have ventured into Lynchian territory with films like Mullholland Dr. or Lost Highway get ready for some more crazy imagery and messed up situations. But Ill be honest this time around, even though the situations and images are very very surreal and strange the story itself is pretty easy to understand. Lost Highway remains a total mystery to me to this day, Mullholland Dr. I had to watch about 6 times to figure out....but Blue Velvet though equally as strange and fascinating as those films mentioned, is actually easy to follow and understand.\n\nI loved Kyle MacLachlans character and it was very interesting to see him go through the changes he goes through after he makes his discoveries. He isn't quite the same anymore after he sees the things he sees and does the things he does. Loved that scene in which Laura Dern tries to let him see that even though there's some crazy things in this world there's some good bound to show up sooner or later. Laura Derns character was beautiful and innocent, the one thing that could bring balance to MacLachlans character. By far the most interesting and memorable thing in this film is Dennis Hoppers character, yes my friends, I'm talking about that crazy, demented, sex-crazed freak known as Frank Booth.\n\nFrank Booth is one of those characters that just oozes with evil. You don't feel like its this actor playing some villain, when that happens you totally stop believing that said villain is dangerous. Not so here. Hopper looks, breaths and speaks pure evil! Your kind of scared that there might actually be people like him out in the real world. His scenes and dialog is truly disturbing stuff....."Ill f##C@ anything that moooves!" \n\nI loved the visual aspect of the film which was -as is usual in a Lynch film- extremely beautiful. We may be looking at sliced human ears and demented sex freaks...but everything is photographed within the context of beautiful haunting colors, exotic plays of shadows and lights. Great visuals. The music is incredible as well. Lynch seems to be fond of lounge singers cause very much like he did in Mullholland Drive in Club Silencio, we get another sequence much like that one, with Isabella Rosellini singing us "Blue Velvet" the title song. And there's also a sequence which is very very humorous yet strange and alluring....Dean Stockwell singing Roy Orbinsons "In Dreams". Awesome sequence, one of the most memorable sequences on this film or any other Lynch film. When that scene comes on, you'll be transported to another time and place. What time and place it is Ill leave it up to you.\n\nAll in all a great Lynch film not to be missed. A masterpiece that lets me know why Lynch is one of the greatest American directors ever to be in the business of making bizarro, beautiful cinema.\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 (and very very much so!)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No chemistry among the cast, Dominic Cooper just didn't have the presence or physicality you would expect of a SBS Agent. The villain was underwhelming and even at the end of the film I'm still not sure what the motive was.\n\nEven with all the great locations and scenery, it couldn't carry the bland and unimaginative story line.

Like a good painting, his movies tell a story, which much like an abstract painting, is not always easy to figure out. But what a treat it is to try.\n\nBlue Velvet is a story about a young man returning to his hometown to visit his father who is sick in the hospital. Upon his return he stumbles upon a frightening discovery: a human ear lying on the grass as he walks through the forest behind his parents home. He then takes it upon himself to discover where this ear came from and discovers that that ear will be the reason why he discovers that this is in fact a very strange and dangerous world in which we live in.\n\nLynch is synonymous with the strange and unusual and Blue Velvet is a good example of this.

But Ill be honest this time around, even though the situations and images are very very surreal and strange the story itself is pretty easy to understand. Lost Highway remains a total mystery to me to this day, Mullholland Dr. I had to watch about 6 times to figure out....but Blue Velvet though equally as strange and fascinating as those films mentioned, is actually easy to follow and understand.\n\nI loved Kyle MacLachlans character and it was very interesting to see him go through the changes he goes through after he makes his discoveries. He isn't quite the same anymore after he sees the things he sees and does the things he does. Loved that scene in which Laura Dern tries to let him see that even though there's some crazy things in this world there's some good bound to show up sooner or later. Laura Derns character was beautiful and innocent, the one thing that could bring balance to MacLachlans character. By far the most interesting and memorable thing in this film is Dennis Hoppers character, yes my friends, I'm talking about that crazy, demented, sex-crazed freak known as Frank Booth.\n\nFrank Booth is one of those characters that just oozes with evil. You don't feel like its this actor playing some villain, when that happens you totally stop believing that said villain is dangerous. Not so here. Hopper looks, breaths and speaks pure evil! Your kind of scared that there might actually be people like him out in the real world. His scenes and dialog is truly disturbing stuff....."Ill f##C@ anything that moooves!" \n\nI loved the visual aspect of the film which was -as is usual in a Lynch film- extremely beautiful. We may be looking at sliced human ears and demented sex freaks...but everything is photographed within the context of beautiful haunting colors, exotic plays of shadows and lights. Great visuals. The music is incredible as well. Lynch seems to be fond of lounge singers cause very much like he did in Mullholland Drive in Club Silencio, we get another sequence much like that one, with Isabella Rosellini singing us "Blue Velvet" the title song. And there's also a sequence which is very very humorous yet strange and alluring....Dean Stockwell singing Roy Orbinsons "In Dreams". Awesome sequence, one of the most memorable sequences on this film or any other Lynch film. When that scene comes on, you'll be transported to another time and place. What time and place it is Ill leave it up to you.\n\nAll in all a great Lynch film not to be missed.

It Doesn't Make Sense " - You're Not Wrong","reviewBody":"This is a remake of a 1980s film where America gets occupied by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Hardly a credible premise but you have to meet it on its own right wing terms . Originally this remake was going to feature an occupation of America by the Chinese . Hardly a credible premise but the fact American films get shown in China nowadays means there's a massive potential market and being worried about losing money the producers then changed the enemy invasion force to the North Koreans . This is where the whole movie collapses from the outset \n\nSome people have defended this film on the grounds that such an invasion could be possible down to the fact that NK has an army of one million people under arms . Indeed it does but this misses out that it lacks any logistical capacity . While amateurs talk tactics professionals talk logistics . NK lacks any force projection . By this I mean it lacks any capacity to invade neighbouring countries . It has no real serviceable navy and even a possible invasion of South Korea would involve hundreds of thousands of troops being transported in either trucks or on foot so any surprise attack on America by NK is laughable . The screenplay does try to get around this unconvincing premise by stating the Koreans have launched an attack by EMP weapons that have destroyed America's communication systems and are are being helped by the Russians though it's never stated why the Russians would be brothers in arms with North Korea \n\nJohn Milius wrote the original RED DAWN as a right wing wish fulfillment . The world has changed beyond all recognition since then so what's the political subtext ? Is there one ? I'm not sure .

It Doesn't Make Sense " - You're Not Wrong","reviewBody":"This is a remake of a 1980s film where America gets occupied by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Hardly a credible premise but you have to meet it on its own right wing terms . Originally this remake was going to feature an occupation of America by the Chinese . Hardly a credible premise but the fact American films get shown in China nowadays means there's a massive potential market and being worried about losing money the producers then changed the enemy invasion force to the North Koreans . This is where the whole movie collapses from the outset \n\nSome people have defended this film on the grounds that such an invasion could be possible down to the fact that NK has an army of one million people under arms . Indeed it does but this misses out that it lacks any logistical capacity . While amateurs talk tactics professionals talk logistics . NK lacks any force projection . By this I mean it lacks any capacity to invade neighbouring countries . It has no real serviceable navy and even a possible invasion of South Korea would involve hundreds of thousands of troops being transported in either trucks or on foot so any surprise attack on America by NK is laughable . The screenplay does try to get around this unconvincing premise by stating the Koreans have launched an attack by EMP weapons that have destroyed America's communication systems and are are being helped by the Russians though it's never stated why the Russians would be brothers in arms with North Korea \n\nJohn Milius wrote the original RED DAWN as a right wing wish fulfillment . The world has changed beyond all recognition since then so what's the political subtext ? Is there one ? I'm not sure . One of the protagonists is a former veteran of the Iraqi conflict and leading the band of guerrilla fighters he makes the point " When I was abroad we were the good guys because we brought order . Now we're the bad guys because we bring chaos " I fail see the thinking behind this . Order=good , chaos = bad ? How is that then ? Surely it should be democracy good , tyranny bad ? If you're expecting any profound discussion about the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter you're watching the wrong film because the remake of RED DAWN is more concerned about setting up action packed set-pieces where brave Americans kill nasty Asiatic commies \n\nEven then the action scenes collapse when you give them any thought .

His wife, Lori (Sharon Stone) isn't so keen on it--she'd prefer a trip to Saturn, or a space cruise. Riding on the subway one day, Quaid notices a television advertisement for a company named Rekall, which specializes in memory implants of vacations. Quaid checks into it as an alternate means of having a "Mars vacation". While at Rekall, he chooses an alternate personality upgrade of a secret agent. However, while undergoing the procedure, something goes wrong. He learns that his Quaid identity was a memory implant and he really _is_ a secret agent. Now that he has his real memory back, he's on the run and he escapes to Mars. But why is everyone after him? \n\nTotal Recall, based on "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale", a short story from 1974 by Philip K. Dick (and novelized in conjunction with the film production by Piers Anthony), had a laborious history getting to the silver screen. Tens of drafts were written. Production companies were attached then went out of business. Many directors and stars were attached who either changed their minds or who were dropped. Luckily, Arnold Schwarzenegger talked Carolco into picking up the project for him, with Paul Verhoeven--who'd already proved his mettle on the similarly toned RoboCop (1987)--on board as director, because this is an excellent film.\n\nWhile Total Recall certainly has influences, including "The Martian Chronicles" (1980), Dune (1984) and the first major film based on a Philip K. Dick work, Blade Runner (1982), it's more notable for the films that it has influenced in subsequent years, including The Fifth Element (1997) and many of the "rubber reality" films such as Abre los ojos (1997)/Vanilla Sky (2001) and The Thirteenth Floor (1999). It's also yet another film on the very long list that have had various elements "adapted" into part of The Matrix (1999)--most explicitly here, the "bug" that Quaid has to remove from his body with a high-tech machine and the possibility of "waking up" from a particular reality by taking "the red pill".\n\nAlthough it's easy to interpret Total Recall in a very straightforward manner, so that the bulk of what we're seeing at any particular moment and the bulk of the dialogue are the literal reality, very convincing arguments can be made that the majority of the film is a depiction of Quaid's memory implant while in the "patient's chair" at Rekall. And those certainly aren't the only two interpretations possible.\n\nWhat matters more than thinking one has a "right answer", though, is the deeply captivating story that provokes our interpretations and the amount of fun we have getting there. Verhoeven and the scriptwriting team, which included Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, the writing team behind the Alien films (beginning with Alien, 1979), never let us go very long without another plot twist, most of which force a reinterpretation of the material that went before. The twists occur about once per every ten minutes, if not more frequently.\n\nThe film is notable for its special effects by Rob Bottin, which were far ahead of their time, and its fantastic production and art design, which manage to make us feel both that we're experiencing a vicarious trip to a "future grunge" Mars and an almost "Doctor Who" (1963)-ish absurdly artificial reality, complete with supersaturated red skies, ala Frank R. Paul's illustrated covers for the Amazing Stories fiction magazine.\n\nSome locations in Mexico were used for the film, including some subway shots on Mars, and actual commercial sign age was incorporated into the film. There's a lot of fun to be had noticing all of the cultural differences and similarities that the future era of the film will bring. Verhoeven delights in subtle glimpses of various symbols and accoutrement's. His view of the future is one full of corruption, commercialism and decadence. He doesn't have much confidence in a "bright new world" as humans spread out to new territory.\n\nVerhoeven is basically extending the way things are now to the future; it's as if he sees our state as indicative of human nature, so that as long as we're humans, people are going to be taking advantage of one another, trying to control one another, engaging in behavior that's a conflict between desires and societal mores, but also helping out each other when the going gets tough. In these respects, Total Recall has culture-satirical similarities to later films such as Starship Troopers (1997), which isn't surprising given that Verhoeven directed both films. It's notable that Total Recall's future is not quite as bleak as Starship Trooper's.\n\nBut the film is hardly less violent. Verhoeven's initial cut was given an X by the MPAA for violence. A number of scenes had to have small edits, most of which have thankfully been restored on at least one special edition DVD. The violence here is a lot more small scale and personal than Starship Troopers. In terms of the visceral, Total Recall often rides a gray area somewhere between action and horror. While the action isn't as explosive as many Schwarzenegger films, the suspense never resolves until the end. This is an amazing thrill ride of a film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":307664,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now don't get me wrong, this most certainly is a sick and twisted film, but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected.  Maybe that is due to this film having a different director, but nonetheless the film wasn't as graphic as I'd expected.

If you like thrillers and can handle the subject of pornography and "snuff" films, then you should definitely give this film a chance.\n\nI'm a little surprised that this film has such a low rating on IMDB.  I can see why someone wouldn't like it, but I can't see why it would have such a low rating.  I would assume that most viewers couldn't handle the subject and therefore gave the film a low rating.\n\nAll of the actors involved in this film did a very good job.  Nicholas Cage was great as always (sometimes a little over-acting, but most of the time he was great).  James Gandolfini, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Storemare, Anthony Heald, Catherine Keener, and the rest of the supporting cast all pulled off solid performances.\n\nJoel Schumacher really needs to stick with films like this.  He really does a great job with thriller/drama type films (and needs to steer clear of certain super-hero films).  Joel did a great job with this film and I look forward to his next work.\n\nThe only complaint I have about the film is the music.  There were some times were the music was perfect or tolerable, but there were others where it was just horrible and detracted from the film.  Some of the music in the film was too bizarre and didn't fit with the film.\n\nLike I said, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I thought this was an excellent film.  I hope you enjoy the film.

(Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1043597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"duration":"PT2H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Elif je priča o dobrodušnoj djevojčici koja postaje pijun u suparničkim igrama obitelji Emiroglu... Elif je priča o dobrodušnoj djevojčici koja postaje pijun u suparničkim igrama obitelji Emiroglu. Elif ima samo šest godina kada je njena majka Melek tajno prepušta imućnom Emiroglu domaćinstvu da u njemu, poput svoje majke, odraste kao sluškinja na imanju. Iako to ona ne zna, Elif je dijete Kenana Emiroglua, najstarijeg sina u obitelji. On nije svjestan da je Elif njegovo dijete, iako je bio zaljubljen u njenu majku Melek prije nego ga je ona, kako on to misli, napustila. Zapravo, Melek je prije šest godina pobjegla sa imanja, plašeći se za život svoje kćerke. Da li sada Elifina urođena dobrota može ispraviti sva zla učinjena njoj i njenoj obitelji i donijeti sreću na Emiroglu imanje?Melek je bila sluškinja koju je primila bogata obitelj Eiroglu. Zaljubila se u njihovog omiljenog sina, Kenana, te joj je on uzvratio ljubav. Kenanova obitelj je bila protiv ove veze i njegova majka - Aliye - je otjerala Melek od njega kada je saznala da Melek nosi Kenanovo dijete. Rekla joj je da ode ili će joj ubiti dijete. Melek nije imala drugog izbora do da ode te ostavi Kenana u uvjerenju da ga je napustila. Kenan ne zna za bebu.Aliye je imala druge eplanove za svog sina, brak sa Arzu, koja ju je uvjerila da je ona bolji izbor za Kenana. Kenan zapravo ne voli Arzu koja je vrlo pakosna osoba, sa svojim razlozima za brak sa Kenanom. Nakon odlaska Melek, Kenan slomljenog srca pristaje na brak sa Arzu sa kojom ima šestogodišnju kćerku Tu?çe. Kenan ne zna da on u stvari nije njen otac.Melek je nesretna osoba. Napustila je imanje i započela vezu sa Veyselom Şimşekom, besciljnim čovjekom, ne samo nesposobnim da se brine za obitelj već i nasilnikom i zaduženim kockarom. On prijeti da će prodati Elif da otplati neke dugove i Melek je ponovo prisiljena na velike odluke da bi spasila svoju kćerku. Potajno posjećuje Emiroglu imanje i Elif prepušta na brigu dobroćudnoj šefici posluge, Ayşe Do?an. Ayşe je religiozna osoba i Melek joj se jako dopala. Ona zna sve o Kenanu, Melek i Elif te pristaje prihvatiti dijete i pomoći koliko može.Serija prati život Elif na imanju. Ona ima dobar utjecaj na ljude i zbog njene osjećajnosti i šarma, svi dobri ljudi na imanju je jako vole. Ipak, razmažena Tu?çe je često zlostavlja i loše se odnosi prema njoj. Kenan je očaran sa Elif ne znajući da mu je ona zapravo kćerka. Postaju bliski i Elif uvijek uspjeva da ga oraspoloži.Puno je tajni i suparništava među obitelji i poslugom. Serija prati kako svako nastoji manipulirati drugima ali to naposlijetku ne uspijevaju zahvaljujući utjecaju Elif, nevinog i dobroćudnog djeteta.</desc>

Shortly after their arrival, a series of brutal ritualistic child murders plague the city, and his son becomes gravely endangered.\n\nThis little-talked-about late '80s quasi-horror film starts out promising--there are ominous deaths, grim warnings, and disturbing occult murders involving young children. The focus here is urban take on Santeria that has been appropriated and perverted for nefarious purposes. The first half of the film is quite engaging, with Sheen's character slowly descending into this world and learning more and more about it, including benevolent forms of it, which are practiced by his Puerto Rican housekeeper.\n\nAt its core, the film is truly about the blind leading the blind--people so dedicated to an ideological belief that they are willing to engage in horrific acts to validate it, and drag others into their underworld. Like much of John Schlesinger work, "The Believers" is quite stylish, and there is a fair amount of suspense in the first two-thirds of it--but by the final act, the film begins to wobble into the realm of ridiculousness a bit. Despite the fact that it runs nearly two hours, there is a surprising amount of connective tissue missing from the film, particularly regarding the cult practices and their overall intentions--while there are so vague implications, it feels quite oblique. There are two plot twists thrown into the mix in the last twenty minutes, and a showdown in a warehouse that feels frightfully overwrought and unbelievable. The film does end on a grim, immediate note, however, which does mitigate some of this.\n\nOverall, I found this film quite engaging, though it lacks cogency, particularly in the third act. It is admittedly stylish and well-acted, but it leaves too many unnecessary voids behind given its runtime. I suspect the film may have been a victim of editing problems based on the way it is pieced together, though it's difficult to know for certain. Worth a watch for fans of cult-themed films, despite its lack of clarity at times. 6/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6394,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In this movie there are four scary stories being told some written by Stephen King from his short stories and some written by Romero and SK. These stores, for that time, were pretty scary and freaked me out when they came in theaters. There are many great things about this movie that I enjoyed but there was, however, one huge things that I did not like about this movie. Regardless, it's about time for two horror geniuses to team up and do something good for a change.\n\nFirst off, the movie itself is about a comic book similar to Tails and the four stories in the movie come directly from the Creepshow comic books. The reason why that this idea works in not only the principle of bringing a comic book to life but the way it was shot, edited and lit. The camera angles had very defined and geometrical angels, similar to those that you would see in a comic book. The lighting when something horrible happens turns red, or if somebody is screaming the background turns to a shattered red background, thereby giving each scene a more comic book-like feel to visual picture. It had choppy edits and quick cuts, which we all know that comic books have. So we have a visual perspective of a comic, the overall pattern and texture of a comic and now we have the quick stimulus of a comic.\n\nBetween each story there is a sub-story dealing with a young boy who finds the Creepshow comic book and how little by little he becomes more possessed by it. These intermissions also incorporate The Creep or our host for the evening. This character is by far the Crypt Keeper or the Vault Keeper to our mockup of Tales. Like the Crypt Keeper in the actual comic, he begins each segment with a scene setup and a conclusion, however he does not talk, he just blows around in the wind. With the beginning of each new story it starts out with a still scene of that story with heavy rotoscoping to make it look as if it is a comic book page, then fades out to a real-life still image and then begins. The same could be said about the ending. The clever technique gives the viewer a further illustration that this is a comic book come to life.\n\nThough this movie strikes it rich on my scare-o-meter there is just one thing that took me out of the movie just a little. I know what they where going at when they decided this concept and I understand it was a good idea but it doesn't work when it gets put on film. The campy one-liners, the cheesy sub-story and the lame screams. Of course its predecessor did the same thing, I don't think that it works as well on film as it does on paper. I think it was a nice try though.\n\nOverall I do believe that this is a horror/parody classic and that many horror fans, if not cult horror fans, would like this movie for what it is.

A movie worth buying a ticket for.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43249,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta.

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.\n\nThe show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).\n\nFor pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?!

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Grenvile je i dalje na usluzi zajednici na svoj neponovljivi način. Željan zarade, Grenvile smišlja razne nepromišljene planove za podsticanje kupaca da ostave što više novca, ali retko kad postiže očekivane rezultate. Liroju ne nedostaje ženske pažnje, a Grenvilovo udvaranje staroj ljubavi Mavis stalno ometa njena žestoko zaštitnička sestra Madž.

Iako se međusobno odlično razumiju, vanjski svijet je za njih zagonetka. Srećom, Pejdž Dinin (Katharine McPhee) ima mladog sina koji će ih "prevesti" u vanjski svijet.

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela.

Iako se međusobno odlično razumiju, vanjski svijet je za njih zagonetka. Srećom, Pejdž Dinin (Katharine McPhee) ima mladog sina koji će ih "prevesti" u vanjski svijet.
