U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

Lately, the show has been more focused on Iris...which is a huge mistake! Ever since they put her as pretty much the lead since the Crisis crossover, every episode has been the lowest rated in series history! Go back to making this show about The Flash bc when you did it was still entertaining! I absolutely don't mind women as leads in action shows but the CW is getting ridiculous. This is even coming from a liberal who's all about equality but EVERY show now has a woman as it's lead now (Supergirl, Catwoman, Stargirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Green Arrow &amp; The Canaries, and now even The Flash and Black Lightening are all about girl power! They even have a Kung-Fu remake coming that changed the lead to a woman. I mean WTF?)! Every woman is portrayed as smart and tough while the men are stupid and weak! Most of them like Laurel Lance &amp; Catwoman look so ridiculous in their fight scenes. It doesn't look like their kicks would hurt a 3-year old but a grown man goes flying or knocked out from a hit that again, wouldn't hurt a child!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":314668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Lately, the show has been more focused on Iris...which is a huge mistake! Ever since they put her as pretty much the lead since the Crisis crossover, every episode has been the lowest rated in series history! Go back to making this show about The Flash bc when you did it was still entertaining! I absolutely don't mind women as leads in action shows but the CW is getting ridiculous. This is even coming from a liberal who's all about equality but EVERY show now has a woman as it's lead now (Supergirl, Catwoman, Stargirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Green Arrow &amp; The Canaries, and now even The Flash and Black Lightening are all about girl power! They even have a Kung-Fu remake coming that changed the lead to a woman. I mean WTF?)! Every woman is portrayed as smart and tough while the men are stupid and weak! Most of them like Laurel Lance &amp; Catwoman look so ridiculous in their fight scenes. It doesn't look like their kicks would hurt a 3-year old but a grown man goes flying or knocked out from a hit that again, wouldn't hurt a child!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":314668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If the producers want to use the original theme song, then why shorten it? It reminded me of the truncated TV tunes of re-runs in syndication.\n\nNow for the pilot episode. I thought it odd that Hawaii 5-0 would open with a scene in South Korea. It's like stumbling out of bed in the morning not exactly sure what you're going to do that day.\n\nThere are also seemed to be to much gun play and not enough acting. The dialog and some of the background setup (Danno's family situation, for example) was a bit too cliché. Some of the personal background could be better developed over time rather than cramming it into one episode while chasing the bad guys.\n\nThe overall storyline for the pilot was excellent, though. It gave background to 5-0's beginnings and it maintained a certain consistency and plausibility with TOS while adding the dimension of McGarrett and his father.\n\nSome of the dialog resulted in an approving chuckle from me.\n\nThe episode began to gel about 2/3 in and by the end of the show, I felt comfortable with the main characters and looked forward to the next chapter.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":681307,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":681307,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(movie directed by Rob Reiner), Nora Ephron has finally matched it, at least with one story in her latest attempt titled Julie &amp; Julia. In the meantime, combining it with her writing talents, she has directed a string of movies, including her commonly most acclaimed film Sleepless in Seattle, as well as seriously under-appreciated, though oddly amusing lineup of eccentric characters, brought together in the movie Mixed Nuts, remade from its French original.\n\nJulie &amp; Julia has immediately placed itself on top of my personal list of her self-penned directorial accomplishments. Based on two true stories, movie combines six decades separated lives of Julia Child (Meryl Streep), wife of an American diplomat (Stanley Tucci) in post-WW2 Paris, discovering her passion for French cuisine, then introducing it to American amateurs, and modern era Julie Powell (Amy Adams), professionally reduced to a hot line counselling 'cubicle girl', desperately entertaining her unfulfilled literary ambitions via blogging about her attempt to try and finish all 524 recipes from Julia Child's cookbook in 365 days.\n\nMs. Streep's acting is great as always, this time even aided by the physical grandeur of her greater-than-life on-screen persona, undoubtedly achieved by means of never visible pair of platform shoes, providing that she's impersonating genuinely tall person, as real Julia Child apparently was. Adding to it Mr. Tucci's notable performance in his role of a diplomat and supportive husband, as well as Ms. Adams's, well, not so remarkable, but still passable performance in her role of Julie, backed by yet another understanding and supportive husband (Chris Messina), combined they present us with the movie abundant not only with gastronomic treats, but cinematic ones, as well. (8-star rating as a rounded up average between 9-star Julia's and 6-star Julie's story.)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110856,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

(movie directed by Rob Reiner), Nora Ephron has finally matched it, at least with one story in her latest attempt titled Julie &amp; Julia. In the meantime, combining it with her writing talents, she has directed a string of movies, including her commonly most acclaimed film Sleepless in Seattle, as well as seriously under-appreciated, though oddly amusing lineup of eccentric characters, brought together in the movie Mixed Nuts, remade from its French original.\n\nJulie &amp; Julia has immediately placed itself on top of my personal list of her self-penned directorial accomplishments. Based on two true stories, movie combines six decades separated lives of Julia Child (Meryl Streep), wife of an American diplomat (Stanley Tucci) in post-WW2 Paris, discovering her passion for French cuisine, then introducing it to American amateurs, and modern era Julie Powell (Amy Adams), professionally reduced to a hot line counselling 'cubicle girl', desperately entertaining her unfulfilled literary ambitions via blogging about her attempt to try and finish all 524 recipes from Julia Child's cookbook in 365 days.\n\nMs. Streep's acting is great as always, this time even aided by the physical grandeur of her greater-than-life on-screen persona, undoubtedly achieved by means of never visible pair of platform shoes, providing that she's impersonating genuinely tall person, as real Julia Child apparently was. Adding to it Mr. Tucci's notable performance in his role of a diplomat and supportive husband, as well as Ms. Adams's, well, not so remarkable, but still passable performance in her role of Julie, backed by yet another understanding and supportive husband (Chris Messina), combined they present us with the movie abundant not only with gastronomic treats, but cinematic ones, as well. (8-star rating as a rounded up average between 9-star Julia's and 6-star Julie's story.)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110856,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That is the new FBI.\n\nIn almost every episode, the FBI agents discuss the criminals, murderers, terrorists, etc., as being the victims of U. S. society, American values, white America, etc. Every story throws new shade on the FBI and/or the USA as a nation, or American culture.\n\nI have never seen any of the FBI agents say, "Wow that guy was just plain evil," unless it was a white Anglo who was (always) a racist, Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, etc. The message of this show is that white people are evil, and everyone else, including the criminals, are victims of "White America."

I never imagined that any show about the FBI could be so hateful against the United States.\n\nThe assistant Chief of the New York division, played by the lame Jeremy Sisto, spends his time trying to overturn convictions because he spent ten years in the FBI blacking out due to alcoholism, and sleeping with his subordinate, who covered for his mis-deeds. That is the new FBI.\n\nIn almost every episode, the FBI agents discuss the criminals, murderers, terrorists, etc., as being the victims of U. S. society, American values, white America, etc. Every story throws new shade on the FBI and/or the USA as a nation, or American culture.\n\nI have never seen any of the FBI agents say, "Wow that guy was just plain evil," unless it was a white Anglo who was (always) a racist, Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, etc. The message of this show is that white people are evil, and everyone else, including the criminals, are victims of "White America." I am not white, and I find this show incredibly disturbing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you like movies where nothing happens, "New York, I Love You" is a good one to catch.\n\nSo if nothing happens, what's it all about? Well, here we have 10 slice-of-life vignettes of people living in New York City focusing on interpersonal relationships, character drama, and in almost every story some sort of quirky ironic twist.\n\nIn a few cases the ironic twist is enough to make you say to yourself, "Aha! Good one." Segments in this category include a segment starring Robin Wright &amp; Chris Cooper about a woman &amp; man who meet on the street flirting with the idea of anonymous sex, or in the segment starring Olivia Thirlby, James Caan &amp; Anton Yelchin about a boy who goes to the prom with a girl in a wheelchair, or the opening segment starring Hayden Christensen &amp; Andy Garcia about a petty thief who meets his match. Or an impressive directing debut from Natalie Portman about a man who takes a young girl to the park for a day. Each of these may seem light on story, but there's a nice twist to each.\n\nOther segments are a little less twisty in plot, but they make up for it with charming characters or quirky conversations, like the segment with Ethan Hawke using every line in the book to pick up a mysterious woman, or the segment starring the screen legends Eli Wallach ("The Good, the Bad and the Ugly") &amp; Cloris Leechman ("Frau Blucher!" in Young Frankenstein) about an elderly couple who go to Coney Island for the day.\n\nAnd then there's the segment starring Julie Christie as a lonely, retired opera singer who checks into an ancient hotel for a night. That segment stands out for its haunting style and quiet desperation.\n\n"New York, I Love You" is the American version of "Paris je t'aime" released two years earlier, each film featuring a series of shorts highlighting the human love affair with an iconic city. Oddly enough, "New York" features all but 2 directors who were born outside America (including Natalie Portman--did you know she was born in Israel?), so there is a very culturally diverse vibe. This ain't no "Friends" centered around young professional caucasians. It often digs deep into the ethnic perspective with characters who are Jewish (Hacidic), Hindu (Jain...although he points out that Jains are not Hindu because Hinduism is too materialistic haha), Chinese, Iranian, British, and a few I couldn't figure out.\n\nMy only real gripe with this film is that it seemed uneven at times, with the directing styles and stories often shifting gears so abruptly, and without any signals to let you know the prior story had ended and we're on to the next, that you can easily get disoriented. Transitions with characters' paths criss-crossing were inserted to make it more of a cohesive whole, but I think the opposite effect happened. I might've liked it better if the stories were kept very separate, like in the excellent "Tokyo!" featuring 3 very different stories from very different directors. But as far as short film compilations go, "New York, I Love You" is a good solid package that should tickle your nostalgia bone whether or not you hail from the Big Apple.\n\nI can't end without mentioning my favorite film in this genre, "Coffee &amp; Cigarettes" by Jim Jarmusch, featuring 11 short films set in Coffee Shops around the world. If you like this sort of thing, definitely check that one out."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you like movies where nothing happens, "New York, I Love You" is a good one to catch.\n\nSo if nothing happens, what's it all about? Well, here we have 10 slice-of-life vignettes of people living in New York City focusing on interpersonal relationships, character drama, and in almost every story some sort of quirky ironic twist.\n\nIn a few cases the ironic twist is enough to make you say to yourself, "Aha! Good one." Segments in this category include a segment starring Robin Wright &amp; Chris Cooper about a woman &amp; man who meet on the street flirting with the idea of anonymous sex, or in the segment starring Olivia Thirlby, James Caan &amp; Anton Yelchin about a boy who goes to the prom with a girl in a wheelchair, or the opening segment starring Hayden Christensen &amp; Andy Garcia about a petty thief who meets his match.

One of the most essential yet unwritten rules of the genre states: the bigger the names involved in the production, the weaker the shocks and the tamer the blood &amp; gore effects. If this statement were an exact science then "Gothika" would be one movie to avoid at all costs, with its all-star ensemble cast including Halle Berry, Robert Downey Jr., Penelope Cruz, Charles S. Dutton, Bernard Hill and John Caroll Lynch. But this really isn't a bad movie at all, in fact, and the acclaimed names seemingly didn't form any restriction for director Mathieu Kassovitz (creator of "The Crimson Rivers" and the brilliant crime thriller "La Haine"). The good news is that "Gothika" is a surprisingly grim and darkly atmospheric ghost story, with a handful of genuinely eerie set pieces and uncomfortable moments. Perhaps it's the influence of the French director, but it honestly feels like the movie aimed for chills &amp; shock rather than to come across as politically correct.

Next thing she knows, Miranda wakes up as a patient in her own asylum and she's accused of murdering her husband. Shortly after, she has ghostly visions again of the girl she saw on the road, and it seems as if she's trying to tell Miranda something very important, so she better learns to really listen. Even in spite of the sadly transparent and derivative plot, "Gothika" manages to remain compelling and even somewhat engaging. Halle Berry is a marvelous actress (as well as one of the most ravishing women on the planet) and a joy to behold as the 'dame in distress'. She receives excellent support from the always-cool Robert Downey Jr. and I never saw Penelope Cruz deliver a better performance. If I were her, I would accept more crazy-lady roles. This certainly isn't the kind of stuff nightmares are made of, but it's a worthwhile little thriller nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":107762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

An enormous relief, in a film that needed to tell a story, and not turn the experiences of the four girls, and their manager, in to a musical.\n\n'The Sapphires' tells a uniquely Australian story of four Aboriginal girls who overcame the prejudice of the 60s to find themselves sent off to Vietnam to entertain the troops, along with their charismatic, but occasionally inept, manager (Chris O'Dowd). There's a decent ensemble cast, with exceptional performances from Deborah Mailman and Shari Sebbens.\n\nThe film is uplifting, gently deals with some big issues that faced Aborigines and is entertaining to just about anyone. Some criticism of the film was that it underplayed both the Vietnam War itself, and a couple of related events (easily spotted in the film), however I disagree. The film was busy drawing together the strands of storyline concerning the girls. To have emphasised any further the war, or any particular event, could only have detracted from the audience's appreciation of the other characters.\n\nHighly recommended for just about anyone. Non-Australians will be introduced to a little of Aboriginal culture and their struggle for equality, as well as a ripper movie that's fun and funny; Australians will be glad to see a rare story of Aboriginal triumph in the 20th century.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13747,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

An enormous relief, in a film that needed to tell a story, and not turn the experiences of the four girls, and their manager, in to a musical.\n\n'The Sapphires' tells a uniquely Australian story of four Aboriginal girls who overcame the prejudice of the 60s to find themselves sent off to Vietnam to entertain the troops, along with their charismatic, but occasionally inept, manager (Chris O'Dowd). There's a decent ensemble cast, with exceptional performances from Deborah Mailman and Shari Sebbens.\n\nThe film is uplifting, gently deals with some big issues that faced Aborigines and is entertaining to just about anyone. Some criticism of the film was that it underplayed both the Vietnam War itself, and a couple of related events (easily spotted in the film), however I disagree. The film was busy drawing together the strands of storyline concerning the girls. To have emphasised any further the war, or any particular event, could only have detracted from the audience's appreciation of the other characters.\n\nHighly recommended for just about anyone. Non-Australians will be introduced to a little of Aboriginal culture and their struggle for equality, as well as a ripper movie that's fun and funny; Australians will be glad to see a rare story of Aboriginal triumph in the 20th century.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13747,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Out of all the series, this one was the best. \n\nBella is new and improved as a vampire after childbirth killed her mortality. And although her union with Edward was fully accepted amongst the vampire community, their new baby Renesmee (a composite name of Renee, Bella's mother, and Esme, Edward's "mother") wasn't so lucky. After a false accusation, the new family is in grave trouble with the powerful Volturi who only happen to be the largest vampire regime. Even still, the Cullen's are prepared to use their special gifts against anyone who threatens their family.\n\nThere are certain details of this film that one has to accept in order to appreciate it. First, aside from the vampires' requisite to drink blood, the Twilight saga movies focuses on the majestic viewpoint of vampires rather than their dark side. And, when assessing the situation in that way, it might make it easier to digest that teenage Bella was literally dying to be a vampire in order to be with Edward, unbeknownst to her parents and only has to loose her soul to do it. Furthermore, even with Bella and Edward being married, there's no way around the fact that Twilight glorifies teenage pregnancy.\n\nIf these details can be accepted or moved past for the sake of fiction, this film is awesome! I've seen the previous films in the Twilight saga and I thought they were captivating at times but I've never been impressed this much. For starters, it continues to evolve the intense Romeo and Juliet type romance, with a twist. However, the writing in Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 seems to be the best yet. I found myself laughing out loud. The storyline is more witty, interesting, cleverly done and the action scenes are completely unexpected.\n\nEven the actors gave better performances. The highlight performances for me were from the beautiful Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan. Not only did she give a believable performance as an incredibly strong vampire in such a tiny frame, but she made it funny and fascinating to watch. Also giving an always reputable performance was Michael Sheen, who plays Aro, one of the three leaders of the Volturi. There's something about his malicious depiction that is so grimy, yet you'll love to loath him! Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward, was funnier than I ever remember him being. Taylor Lautner, whose character is Jacob, gives another vigorous performance and the other wicked actor that amplifies inhumanity is Dakota Fanning.\n\nI saw this movie surrounded by a packed theater of energetic Twilight fans. It was almost as equally entertaining to watch the film as it was to be amongst the energy of the crowd for Team Edward vs. Team Jacob. And especially all the boisterous fans who were anti- Volturi. Of course the second Jacob took off his shirt, girls in the audience went bananas. Aro and his crew got an equal amount of rowdy boos.\n\nRegarding the topic of appropriateness for young impressionable teens, this film warrants at the least a conversation to your youngsters on issues like intense sexual content, violent murder and teen defiance.\n\nOverall, if you've never seen any of the Twilight saga films, this is the one to see. If you're a fan already you will be blown away with how this final movie goes out with a blast. Go see Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2; it's worthy! Surprisingly, one of my favorite films this year!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235320,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For me I think of a few scenarios that come to mind: an action pack shoot em up movie, something on the lines of James Bond, or following down the rogue agent Bourne pathway. So I can't help but say I was excited for this movie this weekend, especially with Sean Penn leading the cast. With few trailers to give me insight, I eagerly headed to my local theater to give this film a try. \n\nUnfortunately the movie did not go down the expected path, and even worse it took the wrong direction for this reviewer. For those uncertain of the plot, Gunman is about a sniper named Terrier who is targeted for assassination by an unknown group. In order to save himself and his loved ones, he must dig deep into a convoluted scheme that may related back to an incident. I know sounds awesome right, if old hat, but Gunman held some promise of action mixed in with good old fashioned spying. \n\nNot the case my friends. Gunman is actually a snooze fest, being one of the first movies to make me nap in almost half a year. It starts with the pace of the movie, not necessarily too slow, but just enough that you start to lose interest. For me, it wasn't that the plot was boring, but the details they tried to lay out for us were very convoluted, many details ambiguous and confusing in their presentation. May of the scenes involved him obsessing over his former love, which after a few arguments and an unnecessary sex scene, started to grow staler than month old bread. Now don't get me wrong, convoluted plots can be a good thing, but they require a good presentation that keeps one engaged in the movie. And this film did not do it for me. \n\nPerhaps I could have been entertained more if the action had lived up to my, I'll admit, high expectations. The opening shot scene was nothing special, but the following skirmish held some promise for excitement down the line. And in truth, two or three battles brought the flash in the pot, bang in your ear entertainment that I so crave. Despite being an elite shooter, Terrier didn't have perfect accuracy, and had to pull some creative stunts to take down his killers, who by the way could actually hit him. Taking away our hero's invincibility was a smart move, but some battles get led down the wrong path, or are a repeat of an earlier fight. Kills are graphic, the camera not shying away from someone's head getting a new hole, as torrents of red litter the ground. If you are up for this kind of stuff, then by all means stop reading this review and head down to the theater. Looking back over the movie though, I can't say the action was as on point or exciting as I had hoped, nor as fast as these scenes sometime need to be. \n\nHelping save this movie from complete failure was the acting. Sean Penn as Terrier was good. The actor was able to transition across the emotional spectrum, being a relief worker with a little troublemaker streak to an angry killer on the loose. Penn has always had a talent for playing well developed characters, and while annoying as this role is, he still plays it well. Jasmine Trica as Annie was a decent addition to the cast, though I must say her character could have been much stronger than they made her. Trica's main talent involved huffing, puffing, and crying as people died. Her dialog was too shallow for me and they threw her as nothing but an object for Terrier to protect. Javier Barden brings his Hispanic background back to the screen, but his role was very short and unfortunately very sad as a love obsessed, drunk who loses his min. Not my favorite role, but again he does okay. As for Idris Elba, he is hardly in the film for fifteen minutes, really only to bring some "coded" advice and a means to end the movie. No offense Elba, but had you been tailing Penn for the whole movie, I might have boosted your score.\n\nSpecial effects wise the editing worked for me in this movie. Stable camera angles and detailed fighting helped bring the action to life. The battlefields that became the stage for our fights were also beautiful, crafted or located in a variety of settings. Some were cool like a mansion, and others were ridiculous, like at a matador arena. Nevertheless we had an epic soundtrack to add some slight touches of excitement to the mix, as well as high definition pings, twacks, and booms to nearly deafen your ears. Unfortunately the team's cuts of the footage were nowhere near perfect for me, even though they were under the 2 hour mark. I don't know why they kept half of the dialog heavy scenes in, especially when they kept us going in circles. Oh what a waste of good film..\n\nThe Gunman is not the movie I expected it to be, and despite the assembled cast of actors, the potential is lost to fast production. With an overly ambiguous plot, and a pace that moves like a snail, the execution of this movie was below par. Those who are fans of extreme violence and profanity, as well as shots of poverty Africa are at home in this film, but otherwise skip this film for something better. A trip to the theater is not recommended from me, but we all know enough desire can make you see anything. Overall my scores for Gunman are:\n\nAction/Crime/Drama: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.5","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39696,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I saw her in this movie, and I became baffled as to why she wasn't considered for an Oscar nomination.  She carries this film on her shoulders, and never once budges.  Not only does she totally get rid of her Australian accent and perfectly don a Southern accent, but she gives a deep, powerful performance as the innocent widow, Annie Wilson, who is looked down by many in her community but simply wants to share her psychic gifts with her willing clients.  Blanchett communicates great emotion with a simple facial expression.\n\nOf course, I also have to give it up for the multi-talented supporting cast. Though most of them, with the exception of Hilary Swank, couldn't really nail down the Southern accent, they are absolutely terrific.  The only actor I felt was miscast was Katie Holmes.  Not only is her accent phony and over-the-top, but she just seems too young and innocent for the role. Giovanni Ribisi, on the other hand, is a revelation.  I knew, ever since his breakthrough performance in "Suburbia," that he had great promise as an up-and-coming actor, but in "The Gift" he delivers his most powerful performance up-to-date.  I would even argue that he deserved an Oscar nod. He constantly stirs up sympathy in his audience, despite his mental instability and momentary outbursts of anger.  I was also extremely impressed with Keanu Reeves, who delivers a genuinely haunting performance. It's times like this where I just can't fathom why many people still insist on picking on Keanu, regarding him as dull and cardboard.  Personally, I thought he was great ever since his emotional performance in "Permanent Record."  But he better demonstrates his versatility as an actor as the abusive Donny.  He made his debut, as a villain, in the throwaway thriller "The Watcher," but I found him much more haunting in this role.  Plus, he sports a rugged look, totally shedding his pretty-boy image.  Greg Kinnear is good and subtle, and Hilary Swank continues to flaunt her brilliant acting abilities as the vulnerable wife of Donny who constantly takes beatings from him, yet still maintains her love for him.\n\nThe story is very intriguing, revolving around a cast of colorful characters.  This isn't a "scary" movie as it somewhat looks in the previews, but it is full of mystery and thrills, without cheaply going for shock value.  There is a nifty twist at the end, which is credible and not thrown from left field, but the plot isn't packed with surprises.  We're simply going along on an emotional journey, through the mind of our protagonist, Annie, and that's how the tension is created.  Sam Raimi creates a haunting mood and Billy Bob Thornton wrote a fine script.  The story is easy-to-follow, and not as mind-bending as some of these other supernatural thrillers.  Just keep in mind that this is not a horror movie. But it's a good mystery and a good mood piece and a damn good film altogether.\n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64901,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I saw her in this movie, and I became baffled as to why she wasn't considered for an Oscar nomination.  She carries this film on her shoulders, and never once budges.  Not only does she totally get rid of her Australian accent and perfectly don a Southern accent, but she gives a deep, powerful performance as the innocent widow, Annie Wilson, who is looked down by many in her community but simply wants to share her psychic gifts with her willing clients.  Blanchett communicates great emotion with a simple facial expression.\n\nOf course, I also have to give it up for the multi-talented supporting cast.

The hit-man isn't cheap, so to pay the $100,000 he demands for the job, they kidnap a pizza delivery guy, Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), strap a bomb to him and tell him they will blow him up unless he robs a bank and brings them at least $100,000. Then things get weird...\n\nSilly, but fun. Plot is ridiculous, but the movie is carried by the over-the-topness of the performances, especially those of Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari. Very funny, especially McBride and Ansari's dialogue.\n\nJesse Eisenberg plays the straight guy to McBride and Ansari's antics, and does a good job. Nick Swardson is perfect as McBride's sidekick. Good support from Michael Pena, Dilshad Vadsaria and Fred Ward.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96041,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Soon, ghostly forces are at work to attack her and her baby, and once again she enlists the help of the Ghostbusters.  The film is a strong sequel and is almost as fun as the original, but some plot holes and loose ends make this not nearly as good.  The romance of Annie Potts' Janine and Rick Moranis' Louis is funny, but there is no explanation of what happened with her romance with Egon from the first one.  A lot of the story and humor is recycled from the original, but fans of the first film will definitely enjoy this above-average sequel.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Soon, ghostly forces are at work to attack her and her baby, and once again she enlists the help of the Ghostbusters.  The film is a strong sequel and is almost as fun as the original, but some plot holes and loose ends make this not nearly as good.  The romance of Annie Potts' Janine and Rick Moranis' Louis is funny, but there is no explanation of what happened with her romance with Egon from the first one.  A lot of the story and humor is recycled from the original, but fans of the first film will definitely enjoy this above-average sequel.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So unless you at least like cats a little, you may not like Nine Lives. But I can tell you that the kids in the audience I was in--loved it. And so did the adults who came to the movie with me. (Yeah, OK, I admit we like cats.) And I think in the end that may be all that matters. What saddens me are the many critics, and wannabe critics who are trashing, and I mean trashing, this film. Now that they have had their opinions and comments, everyone has a right to MY opinions and comments. Here are a few... \n\nI grew up going to see Disney live action family comedy/fantasy films such as The Shaggy Dog (to which this film is similar), The Absent Minded Professor, Son of Flubber, the Love Bug films and so on. (I think the great theatre actress Helen Hayes was in a Love Bug.) Were these Oscar caliber films? No, they were made to be good family entertainment. Did Oscar award winning actors appear in them...you bet your life they did. If in doubt, check IMDb for the casts of Disney live action films made in the 50's 60's and 70's. \n\nI liked the characters in the film, their connections to each other, and the love shown throughout the film. (Note: I am not mentioning Kevin Spacey, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Garner et al. here, because I saw them as characters not actors. One of the criticisms of the film is that some critics could not believe a certain actor(s) would make this kind of film or play that kind of part. That is not a criticism. Actors play all kinds of characters. It's their job. So I look at how well they played the characters. Were the characters believable? I admit there is some broad character acting. This is not uncommon, however, in a fantasy/comedy, especially one playing to a kid audience. So taking this into consideration—were they believable for a comedy/fantasy film? Yes. Back to what I liked about the characters--I loved that the daughter clearly loved BOTH her mother and her neglectful father. I loved that the ex wife and wife, both very different people, were friends. I loved that the older step brother loved his younger step sister, loved his father and was loyal to him despite the rude things his father said to him. I loved that family love remained constant, although wavering at times, even when the head of the family had a difficult time sharing his love with them. In a cynical world, this kind of family love does not exist, but we can hope for it.\n\nThird, I liked the story. Nine Lives is a comedy but it is also a fantasy. I think this is what some of the critics forget. Fantasy requires that we believe things that may not be possible or logical. If we believe all the things Harry Potter and his friends did, why can't we believe a man could change places with a cat to learn a lesson. (By the way, one of the professors in Harry Potter could change into a cat and she was an Academy Award/Emmy winner.) I do think the business story about the tallest building was weak, but I think that may matter more to adults than kids. (And, who knows it might be the kind of thing that might matter to someone like, say...Mr. Trump.) This part of the story gave an opportunity for the villain(s)to be established, and again for the son to show his loyalty and love for his father and his father's ultimate love for him. \n\nFourth, and this is a personal/technical thing...it was not animated, except for CG effects. I love animated films. Some of my favorite films are animated. In fact there was 15 minutes of nothing but animated film previews before this film started. I felt it was nice to see actual humans...and cats...for a change. Thankfully, too, the cat's mouth is not animated to look like it's talking. There is no Academy Award to-be-nominated song, although I did like "Three Cool Cats".\n\nSo I can't trash this film. It made me laugh. It made me feel good. The underlying message is simple, love your family...if you are human, you only live once so do it right. And if this message is cliché, it can't be said enough, especially in these times. So, if just this is enough motivation for you or you and your kids to see it...Don't paws, go! \n\nPS: By the way, real cats are not allowed in the movie theatre. They will need to wait for the DVD. But I hear that stuffed toy cats are welcome.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21419,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of the criticisms of the film is that some critics could not believe a certain actor(s) would make this kind of film or play that kind of part. That is not a criticism. Actors play all kinds of characters. It's their job. So I look at how well they played the characters. Were the characters believable? I admit there is some broad character acting. This is not uncommon, however, in a fantasy/comedy, especially one playing to a kid audience. So taking this into consideration—were they believable for a comedy/fantasy film? Yes. Back to what I liked about the characters--I loved that the daughter clearly loved BOTH her mother and her neglectful father. I loved that the ex wife and wife, both very different people, were friends. I loved that the older step brother loved his younger step sister, loved his father and was loyal to him despite the rude things his father said to him. I loved that family love remained constant, although wavering at times, even when the head of the family had a difficult time sharing his love with them. In a cynical world, this kind of family love does not exist, but we can hope for it.\n\nThird, I liked the story. Nine Lives is a comedy but it is also a fantasy. I think this is what some of the critics forget. Fantasy requires that we believe things that may not be possible or logical. If we believe all the things Harry Potter and his friends did, why can't we believe a man could change places with a cat to learn a lesson. (By the way, one of the professors in Harry Potter could change into a cat and she was an Academy Award/Emmy winner.) I do think the business story about the tallest building was weak, but I think that may matter more to adults than kids. (And, who knows it might be the kind of thing that might matter to someone like, say...Mr. Trump.) This part of the story gave an opportunity for the villain(s)to be established, and again for the son to show his loyalty and love for his father and his father's ultimate love for him. \n\nFourth, and this is a personal/technical thing...it was not animated, except for CG effects. I love animated films. Some of my favorite films are animated. In fact there was 15 minutes of nothing but animated film previews before this film started. I felt it was nice to see actual humans...and cats...for a change. Thankfully, too, the cat's mouth is not animated to look like it's talking. There is no Academy Award to-be-nominated song, although I did like "Three Cool Cats".\n\nSo I can't trash this film. It made me laugh. It made me feel good. The underlying message is simple, love your family...if you are human, you only live once so do it right. And if this message is cliché, it can't be said enough, especially in these times. So, if just this is enough motivation for you or you and your kids to see it...Don't paws, go! \n\nPS: By the way, real cats are not allowed in the movie theatre. They will need to wait for the DVD. But I hear that stuffed toy cats are welcome.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21419,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's hard not to fall in love with these people! Each of the 3 movies happens in a totally different place.

Both Aniston and Bateman performed great, but the lack of chemistry was palpable. The funniest thing about this film was how poorly Goldblum fit into his role. He essentially plays the low-screen time advice friend to consult Bateman's character, yet he maintains Goldblum's "larger than life" persona.

Aniston was the only one who felt like she belonged, but like any romcom, a love interest is required and Bateman fell flat. Both Aniston and Bateman performed great, but the lack of chemistry was palpable. The funniest thing about this film was how poorly Goldblum fit into his role. He essentially plays the low-screen time advice friend to consult Bateman's character, yet he maintains Goldblum's "larger than life" persona. I am not typically crazy about romcoms and this one lands right at the median for them in my opinion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99742,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Cowboys are based on a hit theater show that was seen by well over 100.000 viewers (some say even 150.000), proving that an art experiment need not necessarily be abstract, hermetic and addressed to narrow elitist circles. However, one need not see the theater show to enjoy the movie. In fact, it might be quite refreshing to see it without preconceptions. A gloomy middle-aged theater director Sasha (Sasa Anocic) returns to his home town, even gloomier industrial province, where an old friend, the local mayor (Niksa Butijer) convinces him to put on a theater show with a group of amateurs. A group of weirdoes and bizarre looking types arrives for the audition, none of them having any acting or theater experience whatsoever, and the disillusioned director ends up taking them all. From the first shots we are aware of all the fullmonthy and other underdog clichés, but instead of seeing them as a potential flaw, surprisingly they turn out to be one of the best qualities of this movie. Considering that everything has already been said in film (and music) and it is not easy to be original, especially on such slippery ground as with popular comedy, I have to point out the work of the director and scriptwriter Tomislav Mrsic, acclaimed documentarist, who has managed to use all the character, situational and dramatic clichés in such a way that the viewer doesn't feel annoyed by the fact that they have all been seen. Which is a good feeling! The movie Cowboys is an ensemble comedy, and it's all about the roles they play – even if there were only two or three great actors, it would be a success. Mrsic was lucky in that regard, mostly thanks to the fact that he used the same cast as in the theater show. There is the dumb Domagoj (the incredible Zivko Anocic), who remains a mystery until the end: is he a complete idiot, mentally challenged, or both, or is he just pretending? Then, the friendly gypsy Miodrag (played by the equally great Rakan Rushaidat); the postman Javor, an annoying wannabe actor, busy bee and mama's boy played by Hrvoje Barisic, a pleasant surprise. I can only imagine how irritable he could get if directed by such masters of annoyance like Gervais, Merchant or Larry David, but Mrsic manages to keep him likable. That is the main forte and the charm of this movie – a feel good atmosphere, light humor, discreet pathos, free of any presumptuousness. Not to mention the grand finale. Comedy is a tricky business, especially when it aims to appeal to the masses. Anybody can make some drunken friends laugh, but big audiences are tough, and critics even tougher. Mrsic and Cowboys did it, and the fact that they reached their goal without over psychologizing the characters or overdramatizing and by using a bunch of commonplace devices, makes their triumph even greater","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A group of weirdoes and bizarre looking types arrives for the audition, none of them having any acting or theater experience whatsoever, and the disillusioned director ends up taking them all. From the first shots we are aware of all the fullmonthy and other underdog clichés, but instead of seeing them as a potential flaw, surprisingly they turn out to be one of the best qualities of this movie. Considering that everything has already been said in film (and music) and it is not easy to be original, especially on such slippery ground as with popular comedy, I have to point out the work of the director and scriptwriter Tomislav Mrsic, acclaimed documentarist, who has managed to use all the character, situational and dramatic clichés in such a way that the viewer doesn't feel annoyed by the fact that they have all been seen. Which is a good feeling! The movie Cowboys is an ensemble comedy, and it's all about the roles they play – even if there were only two or three great actors, it would be a success. Mrsic was lucky in that regard, mostly thanks to the fact that he used the same cast as in the theater show. There is the dumb Domagoj (the incredible Zivko Anocic), who remains a mystery until the end: is he a complete idiot, mentally challenged, or both, or is he just pretending? Then, the friendly gypsy Miodrag (played by the equally great Rakan Rushaidat); the postman Javor, an annoying wannabe actor, busy bee and mama's boy played by Hrvoje Barisic, a pleasant surprise. I can only imagine how irritable he could get if directed by such masters of annoyance like Gervais, Merchant or Larry David, but Mrsic manages to keep him likable. That is the main forte and the charm of this movie – a feel good atmosphere, light humor, discreet pathos, free of any presumptuousness. Not to mention the grand finale. Comedy is a tricky business, especially when it aims to appeal to the masses. Anybody can make some drunken friends laugh, but big audiences are tough, and critics even tougher. Mrsic and Cowboys did it, and the fact that they reached their goal without over psychologizing the characters or overdramatizing and by using a bunch of commonplace devices, makes their triumph even greater","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not sure if he's heard of a gimbal or a cam tripod, but it was really needed in 80% of this film, as I was getting a headache trying to stay focused on the main scenes. The score was decent, but overbearing and unnecessary in some parts. JCVD was great in this, although not much of his martial arts talent was showcased. For a B-grade film, it was decent. Would I recommend it? Sure, if you're a fan of JCVD, as this is better than some of his recent previous work. Would I see it again? Nope.

His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe.

The Action and special effects, were awesome and Hugh Jackman was funny and cool. But the overall acting in the film was very average. The beginning of the movie felt very rushed, it seemed they wanted to get to the middle very quickly. The middle of the movie was cool but somewhat confusing if you arnt Knowledgebale about X-Men. The ending was the best part, i don't want to give anything away but there is a pretty epic battle at the end. And the ending bridges this movie with the others quite well. I liked this better than X-Men 3 Last Stand, but this wasn't a great movie.

A prequel to a series that i liked a lot. I wasn't worried so much about Hugh Jackman as i was worried about the rest of the cast. After watching it i came out with mixed feelings. The Action and special effects, were awesome and Hugh Jackman was funny and cool. But the overall acting in the film was very average. The beginning of the movie felt very rushed, it seemed they wanted to get to the middle very quickly. The middle of the movie was cool but somewhat confusing if you arnt Knowledgebale about X-Men. The ending was the best part, i don't want to give anything away but there is a pretty epic battle at the end. And the ending bridges this movie with the others quite well. I liked this better than X-Men 3 Last Stand, but this wasn't a great movie. It's a gap filler nothing more.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":475238,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Tako mu daju samo rutinske poslove, poput premještanja sitnog lopova Eddieja na obližnji sud radi svjedočenja. Ali dok napuštaju stanicu, crni kombi im blokira put i maskirani napadači pokušavaju automatskim oružjem ubiti Eddieja. Jack mu spasi život slučajno, ubacuje se u obližnju trgovinu i odmah pozove pojačanje. Detektiv Frank Nougat stiže uskoro, ali Jack shvaća da je jedan čovjek u njegovom timu upravo policajac protiv kojeg je Eddie trebao svjedočiti. Ne znajući kome vjerovati, Jack pokušava pronaći izlaz iz obruča kriminalaca i korumpiranih policajaca i pratnje Eddieja do suda na sigurno, što je ujedno i jedina šansa njih dvojice da prežive ...</desc>

Za vrijeme bombandiranja grada, Logana spašava japanski oficir Ichirō Yashida, koji ga zaštiti od atomske eksplozije. Danas Logan živi u Yukonu i izbjegava svaki društveni kontakt. I dalje ga muče halucinacije Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), koju je morao ubiti kako bi spasio svijet. Pronalazi ga Yukio (Rila Fukushima), mutant koji ima sposobnost predvidjeti kada će neka osoba umrijeti. Šalje ga Ichirō, sada predsjednik Uprave velikog tehnološkog konglomerata u Japanu, koji želi da Logana dođe k njemu kako bi mu vratio davnu uslugu. U Tokiju se Logan susreće s Ichirōvim sinom Shingenom (Hiroyuki Sanada) i kćerkom Mariko (Tao Okamoto). Ichirō želi da Logan svoje moći iscjeljenja prenese u njegovo tijelo i tako mu spasi život te se ujedno oslobodi svoje besmrtnosti. Logan odbija, no te iste noći Ichirōv doktor ubrizga Loganu nešto u tijelo.</desc>

This movie belongs to my top 3 Bebel's movies together with L'animal and Le magnifique.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2249,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kudos to all involved. Rob Marshall has done a fine job in adapting this beloved musical to the big screen (not an easy task), and considering the fact that this is his first big-budget feature, his accomplishment is even more resounding.\n\nThe movie follows the lives of two women, living in the tough city of "Chicago" in the 1920's. Velma Kelly (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) is a sexy stage performer, who finds herself thrown into prison after a fit of rage results in the death of both her husband and her sister who have been carry on an illict affair with each other. The other lady in question is wannabe starlet Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger), a married woman, who after being seduced and duped by her devious lover, get revenge on him by shooting him dead. This act of vengeance also see's her taking a trip to prison, and it's here that a battle of one-up-man-ship commences between the two ladies, as both use whatever means at their disposal to get (a) out of jail and (b) gain the most publicity doing it. The connecting factor between Velma &amp; Roxie comes in the form of an unscrupulous high profile defense attorney Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere), who also knowing when to take advantage of an opportunity, becomes counsel for both women and their respective cases.\n\n"Chicago" is fortunate enough to have several things going for it. Aside from strong direction from Rob Marshall, the film is blessed with memorable performances from it's three leads. Catherine Zeta Jones oozes a vampish nature to her portrayal of Velma Kelly. Looking every inch the star, she commands a strong presence in the film, and appears right at home handling both the singing and dancing aspects of the role with ease and class, not to mention a high degree of sexiness. Richard Gere also plays his part in the movie with aplomb. Despite his questionable tactics and somewhat dubious nature, Gere lends a roguish charm to his character which has you walking away if not liking then at the very least admiring his character's quick skill and cunning guile. Gere is also a strong performer in the areas of singing and dancing (much to my surprise!!). However, it's Renee Zellweger who takes centre-stage in "Chicago" - and boy, does she relish every moment of it. She is without doubt, the "star performer" of this film. With sly nods to past "blonde bombshells" such as Jean Harlow &amp; Marilyn Munroe, Zellweger runs the gauntlet of high and lows that require of her character. From demure &amp; sweet, to sly &amp; munipulative, you never know what she gonna do next. And as with Zeta-Jones &amp; Gere, Zellweger also does justice when it comes to belting out a tune, or doing the hot step.\n\nOur three principals are lucky to have an equally talented supporting cast to back them up. From John C Reilly as the down-trodden husband of Roxie Hart, to Queen Latifah as the "larger-than-life"  matron of a women's prison, everyone in this film is right on the mark with their performances. Yet at the heart of any good musical, is of course the musical numbers, and in this respect "Chicago" does not disappoint.\n\nFrom the opening heat of "All That Jazz", to the saltry "When You're Good To Mama", through to the electric "Cellblock Tango", onto the wistful "Roxie", then to the playful kitsch of "Razzle Dazzle" to the all-out "Finale" featuring Velma &amp; Roxie, "Chicago" scores big-time. The choreography, costume &amp; set designs are all terrific, giving the film the look and feel it's rightly deserves.\n\nWith the high-profile success of "Moulin Rogue" in 2001, "Chicago" is likely to follow in the same footsteps, and hopefully this will continue a trend in Hollywood to bring back "the musical" - with the same love &amp; attention that has obviously gone into making "Chicago". I highly recommend this film.

This time, Antonio Banderas steps into the role of the troubled Mariachi as he continues his quest to rid Mexico of the corrupted drug lord that destroyed his life. Using friends like Steve Buscemi, he finds the town that is harboring his villain named Bucho. The Mariachi's form of questioning normally leads to several dead, a cinematic gun fight, and some classic Sergio Leone verbiage. Unfortunately, our hero does not escape unscathed and finds himself being healed by the likes of Carolina, a bookstore beauty played by Selma Hayek. Together they build a steamy relationship that will help our Mariachi reach his final destination.\n\nAs more gunfights, explosions, and blood rock this independent blockbuster, we soon discover a hidden secret about our hero, one that could change the course of his destination.\n\nThis was an impressive second outing by director Robert Rodriguez. While I was worried that Hollywood would have drained too much of his imagination, it was instead the direct opposite. Hollywood gave him the tools to build an amazing 'sequel'. While different, yet the similar to his independent feature 'El Mariachi', Rodriguez sets the stage for a roller coaster film that makes you hold your breath and pray for more. He has taken elements from his first film and expanded them to new levels. Banderas is perfect as our 'new' Mariachi and the chemistry between him and Selma Hayek cannot be contested. Banderas' ability to control this enraged man was spectacular. They worked as our two main focuses of this film. Coupled with some humorous moments with Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino, this film successfully stood on its own two feet thanks not just to the action, but the actors in their respective roles. \n\nFinally, Rodriguez is a genius behind the camera. He is able to give us exactly the right amount of action, drama, and comedy for our liking. He is the proverbial salad bar of cinema. While giving us this deeply rooted character hell-bent on destroying this drug lord, he also lets our imaginations wander with his comical and cartoonish action sequences. The scenes of men flying through the air after being shot are somewhat comical, yet completely Rodriguez. He has successfully created this world that is all uniquely his own. Rodriguez has done this by giving the world depth and outside characters. He builds suspense and also suspicion all at the same time.\n\nOverall, an amazing film (in case you haven't noticed) that should be found in nearly everyone's film collection. \n\nGrade: ***** out of *****"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Mostly this is just another lightweight Freddie Prinze, Jr. romantic comedy where Jessica Biel is the catch of the day.\n\nPrinze plays his standard romantic hero role and tries to throw in some baseball.  He is fair at both but keeps getting outshined by his supporting cast.  I've never really understood the big sensation over Jessica Biel. She shows in this film that her acting is far inferior to her looks.  Biel and Prinze interact like marble statues, nice to look at but no chemistry whatever.\n\nThe best performances were given by supporting cast members.  Fred Ward does a terrific job as Ryan's dad.  Brian Dennehy is always fabulous in supporting roles and does not disappoint as the coach of the A's.  Brittany Murphy does a fantastic wild thing, with a provocative earthiness that is simultaneously seductive and cute.\n\nThere is not much substance here.  The baseball scenes are weak and the romance is tepid.  The film has some endearing moments but fails to distinguish itself except that it gets goofy far too often.  I rated it a 5/10.  Fans of Prinze and Biel will enjoy seeing them look sexy for an hour and three quarters.  Others might want to miss it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well 3 later and I am hooked. I think Harlots has some good writing and is not at all gratuitous in any way for a show about prostitution. People on here that are trashing it are probably holy rollers that are so uncomfortable with their own sexuality that they cant bother to see it done by others. Other than that I really started watching because of Jessica Brown Findlay. I really enjoyed her in Downton Abbey and was excited to see her in another television series. Well she has not disappointed. Neither has the rest of the cast. I will enjoy the rest of the season and future seasons to come. Very worth your time!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7292,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unfortunately, Frankie ain't no Phryne. The main character lacks the drive and personality one would expect from a female detective in an 1920s male dominated environment. Indeed, aside from very soft references to prohibition and slavery (in that order) the series appears to ignore the social references and culture of the times, and the aforementioned 1920s female detective appears to glide through unencumbered, except for the very soft and predictable love interest from the local news hack. Hardly believable, and only suitable for a kid's series. It's a shame, the period locations, sets and costumes were enjoyable, and the supporting cast was OK. But if the script and the main character are not up to scratch, then you can only produce a mediocre piece. CBC wasted their money on this one. Don't waste your time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1782,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Heck, a lot has changed since the LAST Harry Potter film was released in 2011. The franchise helped change our modern interpretation of what a film series can be. And this prequel spin-off is proof of that. While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.\n\nIn the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.\n\nThe Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films. By the time we got to the last few Harry Potter movies, we weren't exactly looking for a brisk narrative. And I was hoping for this in Fantastic Beasts--albeit, probably unrealistically.\n\nSet in 1926, an English wizard, Newt (Eddie Redmayne), comes to America for McGuffin-like reasons (and unclear, at that). He gets into some trouble as some of the fantastic beasts escape from the suitcase where he's keeping them. As this is happening, he gets mixed in with a normal non-magical human, Jacob (Dan Fogler).\n\nOther assorted things happen that are appealing to the audience. We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.\n\nThis is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.\n\nYou will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the ingress back into the beloved world of Harry Potter.And Easter eggs are scattered all around. Just don't go into it with the same expectations as its predecessors.\n\nTwizard Rating: 93","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":420387,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.\n\nThis is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.\n\nYou will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the ingress back into the beloved world of Harry Potter.And Easter eggs are scattered all around. Just don't go into it with the same expectations as its predecessors.\n\nTwizard Rating: 93","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":420387,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Baš kad se odluče razdvojiti, Linda i Paxton zaglave kod kuće u obveznom lockdownu. Suživot je izazov, ali potpomognut poezijom i obilnim količinama vina, zbližit će ih na najnevjerojatniji način. Nakon nedavnog prekida Linda (Anne Hathaway) i Paxton (Chiwetel Ejiofor) nađu se na nesretnom raskrižju kada ih obvezan londonski lockdown uslijed bolesti COVID-19 prisili da ostanu pod istim krovom. Dok nove odgovornosti ostavljaju uspješnu direktoricu marketinga Lindu razočaranu korporativnim svijetom, Paxton, kreativac kriminalne prošlosti, nalazi se na dopustu. Potpomognuti poezijom i obilnim količinama vina, njihovi napori za miran suživot pomoći će im da ponovno otkriju slobodne duhove kakvi su nekada bili - i postanu opijeni neočekivanom prilikom za visokorizičnu krađu nakita. Pametan, seksi i iznenađujući, U LOCKDOWNU slijedi Lindu i Paxtona dok stavljaju na kocku svoje partnerstvo za priliku da si zauvijek promijene život.</desc>

Sure the book is the story, but the beauty of the book is that your imagination fills in the holes. So no movie will ever be as good as a book in that sense.\n\nPersonally I love movies far more than I could ever love a book. Purely because I get tired of authors spending 20 minutes telling me what a room looks like when with a movie I see it in a blink of an eye and be more than satisfied.\n\nThis for me is a quality movie. It has a great story, a great cast and is more than worth watching.\n\nThis movie will have you thinking all kinds of things. Not just things about the movie, but also you're own life along the way.\n\nI strongly recommend this movie. And hey, it's gotta be better than a book.

However, I feel that the time has come as I'm sick and tired of bookworms always saying'It's not as good as the book' ..\n\nFact of the matter is, a film and a book are two entirely different mediums, so let's dispense with your take on what the film should have been like and how it actually is.\n\nWhen you're reading a book, you're visualising everything yourself. Sure the book is the story, but the beauty of the book is that your imagination fills in the holes. So no movie will ever be as good as a book in that sense.\n\nPersonally I love movies far more than I could ever love a book. Purely because I get tired of authors spending 20 minutes telling me what a room looks like when with a movie I see it in a blink of an eye and be more than satisfied.\n\nThis for me is a quality movie. It has a great story, a great cast and is more than worth watching.\n\nThis movie will have you thinking all kinds of things. Not just things about the movie, but also you're own life along the way.\n\nI strongly recommend this movie. And hey, it's gotta be better than a book. As a movie doesn't need our trees for the story to be told ... Read a book, from the Earth you took!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":160904,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up "Rocky" and is truly a great film.\n\nThe story starts up right where "Rocky" left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.\n\nThis film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after "Rocky" and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.\n\nRocky 2 is really funny, more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes "civilized" in "Rocky 3" and loses his sense of humor in some ways.\n\nThe training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film, slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.\n\nNo film is perfect though. The "Gonna FLy Now" song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They use the "Going the Distance" song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.\n\nAlso the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.\n\nA great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up "Rocky" and is truly a great film.\n\nThe story starts up right where "Rocky" left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.\n\nThis film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after "Rocky" and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.\n\nRocky 2 is really funny, more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes "civilized" in "Rocky 3" and loses his sense of humor in some ways.\n\nThe training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film, slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.\n\nNo film is perfect though. The "Gonna FLy Now" song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They use the "Going the Distance" song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.\n\nAlso the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.\n\nA great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The characters inhabit a flashy world, but its kept on the costumes and sets which are incidental more than anything and the style of the film is kept subtle, besides a great choice of swooping cameras.

So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up "Rocky" and is truly a great film.\n\nThe story starts up right where "Rocky" left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.\n\nThis film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after "Rocky" and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.\n\nRocky 2 is really funny, more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes "civilized" in "Rocky 3" and loses his sense of humor in some ways.\n\nThe training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film, slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.\n\nNo film is perfect though. The "Gonna FLy Now" song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They use the "Going the Distance" song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.\n\nAlso the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.\n\nA great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up "Rocky" and is truly a great film.\n\nThe story starts up right where "Rocky" left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.\n\nThis film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after "Rocky" and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.\n\nRocky 2 is really funny, more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes "civilized" in "Rocky 3" and loses his sense of humor in some ways.\n\nThe training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film, slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.\n\nNo film is perfect though. The "Gonna FLy Now" song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They use the "Going the Distance" song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.\n\nAlso the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.\n\nA great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Loved SOA and expected this to be a lesser substitute, but it is not. Mayans has heart and a great plot. Egaging actors easy to identify/believe. Have to agree the only character who seems out of place is Emily. Hard to understand how the pure little drama queen became accepted by people grounded in the reality of their world.

Good strong characters with great acting all around other than that. Every scene she appears in my brain asks "WHY?"

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father.

A prequel to a series that i liked a lot. I wasn't worried so much about Hugh Jackman as i was worried about the rest of the cast. After watching it i came out with mixed feelings. The Action and special effects, were awesome and Hugh Jackman was funny and cool. But the overall acting in the film was very average. The beginning of the movie felt very rushed, it seemed they wanted to get to the middle very quickly. The middle of the movie was cool but somewhat confusing if you arnt Knowledgebale about X-Men. The ending was the best part, i don't want to give anything away but there is a pretty epic battle at the end. And the ending bridges this movie with the others quite well. I liked this better than X-Men 3 Last Stand, but this wasn't a great movie. It's a gap filler nothing more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":475238,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's just the right time to watch a movie like "Mossad" written and directed by Alon Gur Arye, a parody in the genre of the "Naked Gun" series that combined comedy and espionage made in the 1990s by the American ZAZ trio (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), or of the British films that had as a hero Johnny English (played by Rowan Atkinson), back on screen last year. I saw the movie yesterday evening at its first or second public screening, before the official premiere, in a cinema hall that was full with an audience that reacted enthusiastically. I can bet that a new Israeli cult comedy is about to be born, and that Britain's secret agent Johnny English has now a serious Israeli rival in the secret agent Guy Moran (interpreted by Tsahi Halevi), equally ready to save the world risking to destroy it ten times.\n\nThe satirical arrows in this cinematic parody genre are usually directed towards two main directions - a "serious" theme from an area of activity with visibility and of major interest for the public (in this case the fight against terrorism and the secret wars led by the national spy organizations - Mossad, CIA) and the 'serious' movies related to this theme (here the action films and series such as 'James Bond', 'Mission Impossible', etc.). In order to succeed, such films should avoid dealing with any of the 'sacred cows' and should include as many jokes as possible with references to known realities or famous films, all packed in a story which aims to be coherent but is explicitly not taken too seriously. I think the screenwriter and director Alon Gur Arye has very honorably succeeded to meet these conditions and the result is a fun and engaging movie.\n\nThe pace of jokes and comic situations is considerable and these are present from the first frame before the generic to the last one at the final credits. I'm not convinced that everything will pass the screen to the international audiences, and as the screening had English subtitles I noticed that some adaptations are being attempted. The level of satire and critical humor dealing with the bombastic myths, local bureaucracy, or typology of secret war heroes did not seem to me to fall under anything else in the genre, the latest 'Johnny English', for example. I can say the same thing about the level of acting - Dvir Benedek and Tsahi Halevi are excellent in the key roles, the feminine presences are attractive and expressive, Tal Friedman creates an original role that makes us forget his appearances in popular comic television programs, and the Israeli screen and stage veterans Gila Almador and Ilan Dar act in the movie with obvious pleasure. They all have fun and make us have fun. The less successful parts of this film are related to the coherence of the action (there is no moment of real suspense) and the special effects that have suffered from a clear lack of funds, with results visible today in the era of spectacular graphic effects. These details cannot spoil too much of the pleasure I had watching "Mossad", which has good chances to be the summer blockbuster in Israel, and to be successful elsewhere and beyond its first season of screening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":533,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most of the time, a director faced with this reality will sink into a slew of really bad movies, but so far Tarantino has been either extremely lucky or extremely talented - his third feature film, although lacking in the brutality of its predecessors, contains just as much wit. Based upon the Elmore Leonard novel "Rum Punch," it's packed with the clever dialogue that Leonard is known for in his writing. It's also got a good amount of style, too. It's not a typical Tarantino movie, but is that necessarily a bad thing? In this particular instance, no.\n\nJackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess forced into running jobs for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a ruthless criminal who has no respect for life - or death, for that matter. However, during one of her smuggling efforts, a couple of FBI Agents (including Michael Keaton) nab her and offer her a deal: If she helps them get Ordell, she will be let free from custody. The Feds do not know who Ordell is, but they know he exists, and that is where Jackie comes in. She reluctantly agrees to participate in their sting operation, but all is not what it seems. And when $500,000 dollars disappears from his retirement fund, Ordell stops, thinks, and arrives upon the conclusion that we all anticipate with glee: Jackie Brown did it.\n\nHis partner in crime, Louis (the wonderful Robert De Niro), also decides to double-cross Ordell, with the help of a sexy blonde ditz named Melanie (Bridget Fonda), The movie's twisting plot line and intersecting story lines is very reminiscent of "Pulp Fiction," and De Niro's underrated performance is a real stand-out. The movie's quite well made and enjoyable.\n\nDon't misinterpret what I'm saying. This is no "Reservoir Dogs," nor does it want to be. It's not in the same vein as Tarantino's other movies, at least not at a superficial level. However, it is extremely entertaining, helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source, something he usually doesn't do. But there's also a little-known fact that Roger Avary co-wrote some of "Dogs" and "Fiction" with Tarantino, as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here, Quentin adapts Leonard's novel and does justice. People who say it isn't as good as his other movies because it's recycled obviously don't know what they're talking about.\n\nTarantino started out as a video store clerk, and is the movie buff's filmmaker. Not only does Tarantino share a deep passion for films, but he also knows what most of the real movie enthusiasts want. He has yet to disappoint me with any of his directorial efforts. His own life story would make an interesting movie, and indeed it did with "True Romance," partially based on Tarantino's own self-image of himself. (A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm -- in Tarantino's own case, it was film-making. For Clarence, from "True Romance," it was drugs and murder.)\n\nTarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films, and "Jackie Brown" is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges, packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality. The movie was criticized by Tarantino's die-hard fans for being too different from his other films. However, the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything, the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy.

Kroz duhovit fiktivan prikaz vlastite izrazito individualističke obitelji, Alcott je ispričala domaću sagu o obitelji March - majci (Susan Sarandon) i četirima kćerima koje odrastaju u građanskom ratu u Novoj Engleskoj, uhvaćene u čarobnim godinama između djevojaštva i zrelosti. Film, poput knjige, pripovijeda drame i pustolovine četiriju "malih žena" gospođe March - energične Jo (Winona Ryder), prekrasne Meg, krhke Beth i romantične Amy - te služi kao sjajan prikaz obiteljskog života iz 19. stoljeća i počast obiteljskoj snazi i ženskoj neovisnosti.</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Smiling maybe twice, groaning several times, rolling my eyes several more, and eventually closing them for a few seconds trying to imagine what a movie like this could've been if the quality of the talent matched the quality of the three screenwriters behind this project.\n\nThe first Grown Ups film wasn't great - or even good - by any means, but had the vibe of a cheery, stupid ABC Family movie. The strongest complaint I had about the original film carries over to this one immensely which is that given the immense amount of talent in this film, from the three title characters alone, this should be a much better, much funnier movie. Adam Sandler can be funny when he is given timing and a decent character, Kevin James can always be sweet, simple, and relatable, Chris Rock is one of the funniest comedians working today, and David Spade almost always knocks one out of the park in Rules of Engagement. It's dumbfounding to note that Taylor Lautner has the biggest laughs in the film, and after watching this, I have faith that after the redundant Twilight franchise he'll find work in some solid buddy comedies. However, the first inkling that Grown Ups 2 is terrible is by the sole fact that Rob Schneider himself decided other matters were worth is time than making a film that was almost guaranteed to be a hit.\n\nThe entire event is a plot less picture (not the good kind) that provides its audience with a pathetic array of scenes that seem more like throwaway skits from Saturday Night Live. It's a massively redundant, laundry-list of senseless setups with unfunny payoffs that usually involve something along the lines of bathroom humor, objectification, homophobia, and obnoxious behavior. In other words, it's another Sandler movie. It takes place entirely on the last day of school and revolves around the gang of Lenny (Adam Sandler), Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), and Marcus (David Spade) returns, this time welcoming a more quiet, suburban lifestyle contrary to that of Lenny's in Hollywood, and the ridiculous series of sitcom antics that unfold overtime.\n\nThe plot stops there. What follows is, as stated, a series of cheaply-staged, poorly-performed, witless gags that do nothing but make one check the time. Among the barrage of questions I had while watching this film, one of which was, "who is the target audience here?" My mind resorted immediately to tweens and adolescents, who spend too much time giggling at bathroom humor as is. But then, as the film progressed, it began to redirect its senses to a more sentimental side, which only shows the immense tonal strain the film has which is "create cinematic anarchy for forty minutes before showing that this is a story about being true to ones roots and taking care of the family." The sentimentalism is then mixed with a strangely out of place eighties party that concludes the picture, which will definitely not be appreciated to the fullest extent by the previously mentioned tweens and adolescences, as many of the jokes and period references will fly straight over their head.\n\nThe problem with the film is that it seems so effortless and so poorly conducted. At least with various Sandler films like Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and even the unexpectedly raunchy That's My Boy, I could sense that it was made for somebody, be it adolescents or a bit older of a crowd and stuck with that persona. Grown Ups 2 is a film made with no agenda, no personality, and no spirit. It even resorts to the tireless Sandler cliché of having all the male characters being a cornucopia of stupidity and the female characters being nothing but eye-candy for the men. There are certain things I expect Sandler to be over now, what with approaching fifty in a few years.\n\nYou have a choice as a moviegoer this weekend and the several other weekends Grown Ups 2 is going to play. You can either a see a film that possesses gags as commonplace and predictable as a Fruity Pebbles commercial or use this time as an opportunity to seek out nearby independent features in theaters, at your local video store, or even on Netflix. Say you refute that suggestion and want to see Grown Ups 2 as a pleasant, feel-good movie. I know plenty of independent movies that are pleasant, feel good movies (Frances Ha is one of them and is still playing in many theaters nationwide). Wouldn't you at least want to give money to people who don't believe that you're sitting in the audience because you possess the attention-span of a newborn?

I know plenty of independent movies that are pleasant, feel good movies (Frances Ha is one of them and is still playing in many theaters nationwide). Wouldn't you at least want to give money to people who don't believe that you're sitting in the audience because you possess the attention-span of a newborn? Starring: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello, Nick Swardson, Shaquille O'Neal, Peter Dante, and Allen Covert.

He learns that each animal has a role to play and that both he and Ferdinand the duck are fated to be lunch!  Both take new roles to escape their fate and Babe tries to become a sheepdog.  As Farmer Hoggett begins to notice the unusual way Babe can work with the sheep he begins to groom him for that role  much to the worry of his wife and the other farm animals.\n\nWritten by the guy who wrote the Mad Max films  that's what kills me.  I know it's adapted but how can the Mad Max writer manage to deliver such a sweet film that is unassuming and comic and heart warming.  The plot is great as it is adapted from `The Sheeppig' but Miller's script adds so many comic touches that it's funny throughout.  The characters are all well written so that we care about them and get easily drawn in.\n\nIt's directed well and again feels fresh and different  whether it's the chapter set up or the use of the narrator or the way that the singing mice make the links it all works well.  Because it is gentle and unassuming I found myself involved in it so easily and the themes of finding your own path and friendship are not rammed down your throat but just sit there if you want to get them.  I've seen this several times and the silent, wonderful climax to the sheepdog trials makes me choke everytime (even if it is predictable).\n\nAll the voices are good and the use of animals is faultless.  The use of animatronics is a little ropey at times but the sense of goodwill the film gave me extended to overlooking these minor complaints.  James Cromwell is just superb as the human face in this drama  everytime I see him now I can only hear him say `that'll do pig'.  Babe is a great hero and you feel for him from the start to the end  when he gives a little satisfied sigh it's difficult not to feel warm inside.\n\nOverall this is one of the best children's films I've seen  it's light and unassuming and not a classic but it is comic, gentle and ultimately heart warming  what more do you want?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118650,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He learns that each animal has a role to play and that both he and Ferdinand the duck are fated to be lunch!  Both take new roles to escape their fate and Babe tries to become a sheepdog.  As Farmer Hoggett begins to notice the unusual way Babe can work with the sheep he begins to groom him for that role  much to the worry of his wife and the other farm animals.\n\nWritten by the guy who wrote the Mad Max films  that's what kills me.  I know it's adapted but how can the Mad Max writer manage to deliver such a sweet film that is unassuming and comic and heart warming.  The plot is great as it is adapted from `The Sheeppig' but Miller's script adds so many comic touches that it's funny throughout.  The characters are all well written so that we care about them and get easily drawn in.\n\nIt's directed well and again feels fresh and different  whether it's the chapter set up or the use of the narrator or the way that the singing mice make the links it all works well.  Because it is gentle and unassuming I found myself involved in it so easily and the themes of finding your own path and friendship are not rammed down your throat but just sit there if you want to get them.  I've seen this several times and the silent, wonderful climax to the sheepdog trials makes me choke everytime (even if it is predictable).\n\nAll the voices are good and the use of animals is faultless.  The use of animatronics is a little ropey at times but the sense of goodwill the film gave me extended to overlooking these minor complaints.  James Cromwell is just superb as the human face in this drama  everytime I see him now I can only hear him say `that'll do pig'.  Babe is a great hero and you feel for him from the start to the end  when he gives a little satisfied sigh it's difficult not to feel warm inside.\n\nOverall this is one of the best children's films I've seen  it's light and unassuming and not a classic but it is comic, gentle and ultimately heart warming  what more do you want?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118650,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Isn't it just a "love story" made up in Hollywood show's standards? Of course, it is! If so, why expect more? \n\nCaptain Corelli's mandolin is a romance story in war time (WWII) and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn't count was the "Hollywood standard's" touch... What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot (which was not full of "plot holes" as this one is!) instead of this "sweet story romance, with the perfect ending", which we're used to watch in a great part of Hollywood's movies! Another Hollywood standard's gaffe which is very common is the natives' languages issue. The differences between Italian, Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent, and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a "forgotten" Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it's just little technical details that don't even matter to the plot, but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! \n\nBut the movie has not just bad-sided arguments! On the good side, I can find the original idea (which comes from a book), and the thought that is possible to be Human, and have Human feelings, even inside a War. It's possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie, and at this particular point I wasn't disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another good-sided argument is History's knowledge  The movie is not very deep at that issue, but it's good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the Eastern-South Europe.\n\nGlobally Captain Corelli's mandolin is not a bad movie but it's not as good as I initially though either, mostly because of the "Hollywood show's standards" up-mentioned.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33297,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Isn't it just a "love story" made up in Hollywood show's standards? Of course, it is! If so, why expect more? \n\nCaptain Corelli's mandolin is a romance story in war time (WWII) and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn't count was the "Hollywood standard's" touch... What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot (which was not full of "plot holes" as this one is!) instead of this "sweet story romance, with the perfect ending", which we're used to watch in a great part of Hollywood's movies! Another Hollywood standard's gaffe which is very common is the natives' languages issue. The differences between Italian, Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent, and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a "forgotten" Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it's just little technical details that don't even matter to the plot, but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! \n\nBut the movie has not just bad-sided arguments! On the good side, I can find the original idea (which comes from a book), and the thought that is possible to be Human, and have Human feelings, even inside a War. It's possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie, and at this particular point I wasn't disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another good-sided argument is History's knowledge  The movie is not very deep at that issue, but it's good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the Eastern-South Europe.\n\nGlobally Captain Corelli's mandolin is not a bad movie but it's not as good as I initially though either, mostly because of the "Hollywood show's standards" up-mentioned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33297,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Add her growing personal anxiety and London in shock, and the pace is set for mounting grief and anguish. This anchored woman with property represents the diametric opposite of the lanky ageing Ousmane (Sotigui Kouyaté), who lives a quasi-nomadic life, for years far from home working in France, searching for himself perhaps (remissions of remote workers in Europe are how many families survive back home), just as Elizabeth has found herself amid her lettuces and donkeys in Guernsey. Great to see Sami Bouajila again (as the imam in London), he has aged gracefully. Typical of Islam how the youngish imam calls the towering world-weary Senegalese grandfather "my brother". Respect and affection have many faces, and in this case a discipline that eludes many of the Christian faith. In my house hardworking youths from Mali Senegal Guinea and Gambia pray to Allah separately, each with their own method, but the quiet dignity is palpable. As for Elizabeth and Ousmane, lives overlap often unbeknownst to us. The person you have loved now for a decade may have sat opposite you on the bus when you were both teenagers, without your knowing, or served you at the local café. Later the strands of that tapestry of life may reconnect, who knows (photos of missing loved ones taped to walls). With his stick, trying to navigate the panic and bureaucracy of the overloaded hospitals, Ousmane finds solace in walking through the park and stops to "greet" a mock orange in full bloom (he's a forester by profession), breathing in its fragrance. And at nightfall he finds an African-run café, sitting in silence with his tea and watching a confused and confusing world rush by outside the window. The next day he bumps into the imam again who has made inquiries and shows him the photo of the son Ali he last saw at 6 years old. Imagine the feelings of seeing that young face so full of life, and also the fear of being dismissed as obsolete by this youth with his European schooling and career promise. When she finally meets Ali's father, Elizabeth won't even shake the hand he so gracefully offers. Fear of the Other and the unknown is nothing new for him, and he shrugs off her diffidence and responds with infinite patience and even tenderness toward her, seeing her as a parent like himself. She calls the police on this tired old man with the idea that the son might have some involvement in the bombings, and the interrogation presumes the boy is jihadi. We should remember the total chaos and panic in the aftermath of the bombings, the frenetic search for clues, and the possibility of further bombings. In such conditions our suspicion of everything alien to our narrow lives escalates. And so on: the halal butcher who minds his own business just to survive, the islamic police investigator who struggles with his mandate to hassle Muslims. If you deign to see this story, please watch very closely, there are so many subtle touches, including the first time Ousmane comforts Elizabeth with his hand on hers in the travel agency (1:10:20), a gesture extremely rare for a Muslim man. Bouchareb's film is an essay in (in)tolerance. The surge of joy that their children might be holidaying in France segues into the cold corridor of grief at the truth. Momentarily united in hope, suddenly distanced by grief. Impeccable acting on all fronts. No Anniston and Pitt here, just faces in close-up that show the lines of age and real suffering that is life itself. The cinema world will miss Kouyaté's towering majesty.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3590,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This anchored woman with property represents the diametric opposite of the lanky ageing Ousmane (Sotigui Kouyaté), who lives a quasi-nomadic life, for years far from home working in France, searching for himself perhaps (remissions of remote workers in Europe are how many families survive back home), just as Elizabeth has found herself amid her lettuces and donkeys in Guernsey. Great to see Sami Bouajila again (as the imam in London), he has aged gracefully. Typical of Islam how the youngish imam calls the towering world-weary Senegalese grandfather "my brother". Respect and affection have many faces, and in this case a discipline that eludes many of the Christian faith. In my house hardworking youths from Mali Senegal Guinea and Gambia pray to Allah separately, each with their own method, but the quiet dignity is palpable. As for Elizabeth and Ousmane, lives overlap often unbeknownst to us. The person you have loved now for a decade may have sat opposite you on the bus when you were both teenagers, without your knowing, or served you at the local café. Later the strands of that tapestry of life may reconnect, who knows (photos of missing loved ones taped to walls). With his stick, trying to navigate the panic and bureaucracy of the overloaded hospitals, Ousmane finds solace in walking through the park and stops to "greet" a mock orange in full bloom (he's a forester by profession), breathing in its fragrance. And at nightfall he finds an African-run café, sitting in silence with his tea and watching a confused and confusing world rush by outside the window. The next day he bumps into the imam again who has made inquiries and shows him the photo of the son Ali he last saw at 6 years old. Imagine the feelings of seeing that young face so full of life, and also the fear of being dismissed as obsolete by this youth with his European schooling and career promise. When she finally meets Ali's father, Elizabeth won't even shake the hand he so gracefully offers. Fear of the Other and the unknown is nothing new for him, and he shrugs off her diffidence and responds with infinite patience and even tenderness toward her, seeing her as a parent like himself. She calls the police on this tired old man with the idea that the son might have some involvement in the bombings, and the interrogation presumes the boy is jihadi. We should remember the total chaos and panic in the aftermath of the bombings, the frenetic search for clues, and the possibility of further bombings. In such conditions our suspicion of everything alien to our narrow lives escalates. And so on: the halal butcher who minds his own business just to survive, the islamic police investigator who struggles with his mandate to hassle Muslims. If you deign to see this story, please watch very closely, there are so many subtle touches, including the first time Ousmane comforts Elizabeth with his hand on hers in the travel agency (1:10:20), a gesture extremely rare for a Muslim man. Bouchareb's film is an essay in (in)tolerance. The surge of joy that their children might be holidaying in France segues into the cold corridor of grief at the truth. Momentarily united in hope, suddenly distanced by grief. Impeccable acting on all fronts. No Anniston and Pitt here, just faces in close-up that show the lines of age and real suffering that is life itself. The cinema world will miss Kouyaté's towering majesty.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3590,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Osnivač i vlasnik firme je Spiridon Don Karamarković, nekadašnji pripadnik Legije stranaca, ekspert za sva pitanja i najškrtiji gazda na svetu. Deda mu je rekao da svaki uspešan Srbin mora da ima kafanu i on je ove godine osnovao svoju. Poslove oko kafane poverio je misterioznoj Madam Žaklini koja je naše gore list, ali je ugostiteljsko znanje sticala u Parizu.</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati.

Produkcijska kuća AVA napravila je još jedan pomak u proizvodnji, kako u kvalitetu tako i u različitosti žanra, svojevrsni pomak od prethodnih serija. '' Urota '' je visoko budžetna igrana serija od 12 epizoda, format od 50 minuta, a tematski odredjena kao političko – kriminalistički triler. Radjena je za šire tržište, a radnja serije se odvija u Hrvatskoj, Bosni i Hercegovini i Srbiji.Serija je zapravo strukturirana kao šest igranih filmova ili dvanaest jednosatnih televizijskih epizoda, tako da svake dve epizode (odnosno svaki film) čini jednu priču, a sve su priče povezane kroz desetak glavnih likova.Serija je snimljena u cjelosti filmskom tehnikom. Snimanje je trajalo puna 4 mjeseca na lokacijama u Beogradu, Zagrebu, Splitu, Mostaru,Hvaru... Radnja je smještna u sadašnje vrijeme Hrvatske i regije, u trenutku kada je Hrvatska na pragu novog razdoblja kao buduća članica Europske unije, odredjena grupacija u državi (medju kojima su i neki visoko pozicionirani ljudi) čini niz ilegalnih mjera sa ciljem destabilizacije stanja u državi, a zatim i preuzimanja vlasti.Ova priča čini zaplet prve dve epizode, a u ostalim se obradjuju ostale aktualne teme Hrvatske i regije, kao što su ratni zločini, povezanost kriminala i politike, korupcija, borba protiv terorizma...Zaplet i rasplet svake priče paralelno se odvijaju na nekoliko nivoa. Na političkom nivou pratimo različite zakulisne igre, borbe za osvajanje i održavanje vlasti, dok se istovremeno odvija i obaveštajni rat na terenu, često vrlo krvavog raspleta. Paralelno, pratimo i privatne živote glavnih likova, naročito kompleksno ljubavnu priču izmedju dvoje glavnih aktera.U svakoj epizodi prosječno je učestvovalo oko 50 profesionalnih glumaca (iz Hrvatske, BIH, Srbije, Vel. Britanije i Rusije), korišteni su različiti specijalni efekti (na snimanju i u produkciji).'' Urota '' je započela sa snimanjem početkom marta 2006. a završena krajem juna iste godine. Scenario i režiju potpisuje Roman Majetić, a glavne uloge igraju : Robert Kurbaša, Jelena Veljača, Zijad Gračić, Ksenija Pajić, Duško Valentić, Dušan Bučan, Petar Ćiritović, Petra Dugandžić, Lena Bogdanović, Bane Tomašević, Sanja Vejnović, Branislav Lečić i drugi...</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo.

Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Produkcijska kuća AVA napravila je još jedan pomak u proizvodnji, kako u kvalitetu tako i u različitosti žanra, svojevrsni pomak od prethodnih serija. '' Urota '' je visoko budžetna igrana serija od 12 epizoda, format od 50 minuta, a tematski odredjena kao političko – kriminalistički triler. Radjena je za šire tržište, a radnja serije se odvija u Hrvatskoj, Bosni i Hercegovini i Srbiji.Serija je zapravo strukturirana kao šest igranih filmova ili dvanaest jednosatnih televizijskih epizoda, tako da svake dve epizode (odnosno svaki film) čini jednu priču, a sve su priče povezane kroz desetak glavnih likova.Serija je snimljena u cjelosti filmskom tehnikom. Snimanje je trajalo puna 4 mjeseca na lokacijama u Beogradu, Zagrebu, Splitu, Mostaru,Hvaru... Radnja je smještna u sadašnje vrijeme Hrvatske i regije, u trenutku kada je Hrvatska na pragu novog razdoblja kao buduća članica Europske unije, odredjena grupacija u državi (medju kojima su i neki visoko pozicionirani ljudi) čini niz ilegalnih mjera sa ciljem destabilizacije stanja u državi, a zatim i preuzimanja vlasti.Ova priča čini zaplet prve dve epizode, a u ostalim se obradjuju ostale aktualne teme Hrvatske i regije, kao što su ratni zločini, povezanost kriminala i politike, korupcija, borba protiv terorizma...Zaplet i rasplet svake priče paralelno se odvijaju na nekoliko nivoa. Na političkom nivou pratimo različite zakulisne igre, borbe za osvajanje i održavanje vlasti, dok se istovremeno odvija i obaveštajni rat na terenu, često vrlo krvavog raspleta. Paralelno, pratimo i privatne živote glavnih likova, naročito kompleksno ljubavnu priču izmedju dvoje glavnih aktera.U svakoj epizodi prosječno je učestvovalo oko 50 profesionalnih glumaca (iz Hrvatske, BIH, Srbije, Vel. Britanije i Rusije), korišteni su različiti specijalni efekti (na snimanju i u produkciji).'' Urota '' je započela sa snimanjem početkom marta 2006. a završena krajem juna iste godine. Scenario i režiju potpisuje Roman Majetić, a glavne uloge igraju : Robert Kurbaša, Jelena Veljača, Zijad Gračić, Ksenija Pajić, Duško Valentić, Dušan Bučan, Petar Ćiritović, Petra Dugandžić, Lena Bogdanović, Bane Tomašević, Sanja Vejnović, Branislav Lečić i drugi...</desc>

Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu.

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Lazarevići su članovi beogradskog "visokog društva" i predstavljaju osim svojih indvidualnostima ono što takvo društvo kod nas podrazumijeva: ljubav, spletke, sreću, nevolje, generacijske sukobe, mržnju. Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Domaća serija Kafanica blizu SIS-a je humoristička serija koja govori o jednoj firmi iz Vlasotinaca, koja se bavi rešavanjem raznih problema koje klijenti svakodnevno imaju. Već znamo da je "Agencija za sve i svašta" vlasotinačko preduzeće koje rešava sve probleme svojih klijenata. Osnivač i vlasnik firme je Spiridon Don Karamarković, nekadašnji pripadnik Legije stranaca, ekspert za sva pitanja i najškrtiji gazda na svetu. Deda mu je rekao da svaki uspešan Srbin mora da ima kafanu i on je ove godine osnovao svoju. Poslove oko kafane poverio je misterioznoj Madam Žaklini koja je naše gore list, ali je ugostiteljsko znanje sticala u Parizu.</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Disappointed to the core, save your time, money and if you still want to see then be ready to curse yourself...backed by big production house, critics and fake reviews will start floating soon appreciating the movie, beware.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":87159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So I didn't get my hopes up going into this. Ultimately I found myself liking parts I didn't expect to like and hating parts I thought the movie would get right. The hated would, of course, be the music. The wonderful songs from the original musical have been raped here, updated to reflect today's soulless music market. Everything is drowned in overproduction and all that auto tune synth beat crap. I'm searching for an analogy for this travesty but the closest I think of is when a perfectly attractive and youthful actress starts butchering herself with plastic surgery and Botox. There was nothing wrong with the songs as they were and they should have been left alone. The few new songs here are wretched. I watched with my girlfriend and every time we were enjoying the movie a damn song would start and we would both groan loudly.\n\nThe cast and the way they interacted with one another was the best part. I enjoyed Jamie Foxx a lot, which always surprises me as I never know what to expect from him. His channeling R. Kelly in the musical numbers was a little cheesy, though. Quvenzhané Wallis is hit or miss for me. I liked her but the forced smile throughout the movie felt a bit like mugging. Bobby Cannavale, Rose Byrne, and David Zayas are all good. Cameron Diaz was over the top and not in a fun way. The script is not impressive but there were some nice bits of humor throughout and (mostly) likable characters. The fake movie "Moonquake Lake" they went to see was the highlight of the film. Also, for a movie dripping with anti-capitalist rhetoric and (laughable) comparisons between the present and the Great Depression, it sure is very materialistic and shallow.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34890,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So I didn't get my hopes up going into this. Ultimately I found myself liking parts I didn't expect to like and hating parts I thought the movie would get right. The hated would, of course, be the music. The wonderful songs from the original musical have been raped here, updated to reflect today's soulless music market. Everything is drowned in overproduction and all that auto tune synth beat crap. I'm searching for an analogy for this travesty but the closest I think of is when a perfectly attractive and youthful actress starts butchering herself with plastic surgery and Botox. There was nothing wrong with the songs as they were and they should have been left alone. The few new songs here are wretched. I watched with my girlfriend and every time we were enjoying the movie a damn song would start and we would both groan loudly.\n\nThe cast and the way they interacted with one another was the best part. I enjoyed Jamie Foxx a lot, which always surprises me as I never know what to expect from him. His channeling R. Kelly in the musical numbers was a little cheesy, though. Quvenzhané Wallis is hit or miss for me. I liked her but the forced smile throughout the movie felt a bit like mugging. Bobby Cannavale, Rose Byrne, and David Zayas are all good. Cameron Diaz was over the top and not in a fun way. The script is not impressive but there were some nice bits of humor throughout and (mostly) likable characters. The fake movie "Moonquake Lake" they went to see was the highlight of the film. Also, for a movie dripping with anti-capitalist rhetoric and (laughable) comparisons between the present and the Great Depression, it sure is very materialistic and shallow.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34890,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is something for everyone to relate to in this movie, young or old. It stays true to the book which was a concern all of us had before seeing the movie. However, you don't have to read the book to enjoy this movie. In addition, the adaptation from the book to "silver screen" was one of the better ones I have seen and the transformation captured the essence of the story intact. There were a few additional scenes added to the movie that weren't in the book, but they kept in step with the story and didn't detract at all from the enjoyment of the film.\n\nThe cast was all well picked. The main character of the movie, Greg Heffley (played wonderfully by Zachary Gordon) stayed true to the book and he was totally believable. Everyone felt that this kid actor, Zach Gordon, did a great job of bringing life to this complex character and transforming Greg Heffley from a cartoon stick figure in the books to a real live person, while maintaining all his idiosyncrasies. It was also fun to watch him as, at times, he has these great facial expressions. The beauty of the movie was the added sensitivity and emotionality that presented itself in the film that wasn't available to us in the novel.\n\nIn the movie, Greg led us on an emotional roller-coaster ride throughout the film: first we liked him, then we hated him, then we felt sorry for him, then we loved him. His relationship with his best friend Rowley along with its ups and downs (hey, just like real life) was great for kids to see. For adults, it would remind us of the "real" friendships we had (from simpler times) in those early Jr. High School years. Before computers we had real "live" friendships and we really did go over to our friends' houses to "play".\n\nI did not find the movie "trite" "predictable", or "slow". The comedy was evenly paced and kept the attention of the audience throughout, including my kids. This is a very entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids. If you want a fun, witty, wholesome, and relatable story that will both touch and entertain you at the same time, go see this movie, it won't disappoint.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There is something for everyone to relate to in this movie, young or old. It stays true to the book which was a concern all of us had before seeing the movie. However, you don't have to read the book to enjoy this movie. In addition, the adaptation from the book to "silver screen" was one of the better ones I have seen and the transformation captured the essence of the story intact. There were a few additional scenes added to the movie that weren't in the book, but they kept in step with the story and didn't detract at all from the enjoyment of the film.\n\nThe cast was all well picked. The main character of the movie, Greg Heffley (played wonderfully by Zachary Gordon) stayed true to the book and he was totally believable. Everyone felt that this kid actor, Zach Gordon, did a great job of bringing life to this complex character and transforming Greg Heffley from a cartoon stick figure in the books to a real live person, while maintaining all his idiosyncrasies. It was also fun to watch him as, at times, he has these great facial expressions. The beauty of the movie was the added sensitivity and emotionality that presented itself in the film that wasn't available to us in the novel.\n\nIn the movie, Greg led us on an emotional roller-coaster ride throughout the film: first we liked him, then we hated him, then we felt sorry for him, then we loved him. His relationship with his best friend Rowley along with its ups and downs (hey, just like real life) was great for kids to see. For adults, it would remind us of the "real" friendships we had (from simpler times) in those early Jr. High School years. Before computers we had real "live" friendships and we really did go over to our friends' houses to "play".\n\nI did not find the movie "trite" "predictable", or "slow".

    <desc lang="hr">Sveto mesto: Directed by Djordje Kadijevic. With Dragan Jovanovic, Branka Pujic, Aleksandar Bercek, Mira Banjac. Sveto mesto (A Holy Place, 1990) is based on a literary classic, Nikolai Gogol's 1835 short story, 'Viy'. However, Kadijevic uses it only as a starting point for his own explorations into the dark side of eroticism. Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode.

Sveto mesto (A Holy Place, 1990) is based on a literary classic, Nikolai Gogol's 1835 short story, 'Viy'. However, Kadijevic uses it only as a starting point for his own explorations into the dark side of eroticism. Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode.

(Isaiah 53:3) The only son of a Chicago funeral director, Itsvan Kovak (Rutger Haer) Michael lived literally down the hall from death his entire life. Unlike most young men who never experience death close hand, Michael is steeped in it, preparing bodies for burial with his father. As a young boy, Michael is coaxed by his father into helping prepare the corpse of his mother, by gently blowing on the red fingernail polish his father applies as he lovingly prepared her body, while whispering endearments into her ear. The image is forever seared into his memory, tainting his adulthood with a lack of faith and a sense of detachment. \n\nWhen time came to make a decision about his profession in life, Michael knew well that his options were limited, as he told a friend, "in my family; you either become an undertaker or a priest". Michael chose the priesthood, not out of sense of mission, but as a way out of his bleak existence and a means to pay for college. After he is ordained as a deacon, Michael's guilt over deceiving his superior about his intentions impels him to write Fr Matthew (Toby Jones) about his decision to leave the seminary. He admits he has no faith and feels he has no vocation to the priesthood. \n\nBut fate intervenes before Fr Matthew can act. The two men are involved in a car accident where a young woman is fatally wounded and Fr Matthew looks on stunned silence as Michael blesses the victim reluctantly yet tenderly as she dies. He is impressed by this and convinces Michael to delay leaving the seminary until after he has taken a two month course in Rome. A course in exorcism; "you're an undertaker, so you're not squeamish" he adds with a gleam in his eye.\n\nNot at all squeamish, Michael plays the role of devil's advocate in his exorcism class in Rome, challenging his instructor over whether the possessed are suffering from psychosis, and is nonplussed over a sudden power outage when the demon Baal is mentioned. In order to help Michael overcome his doubts about the existence of Satan, his professor, Fr Xavier (Ciaran Hinds) sends him to observe veteran exorcist Fr Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins). Michael is joined in his doubts by Italian journalist Angeline (Alice Braga) who wants him to share his experiences at Fr Lucas side for the purposes of an article. These two young cynics are about to engage in a life and death struggle which will evoke deep- seated fears and upend their world view\n\nAn eccentric Welshman, Fr Lucas lives a lonely existence in an obscure corner of Rome, occupying an ancient villa whose courtyard is overrun by cats. Fr Lucas takes Michael's cynicism in stride, and advises Michael not to engage in conversation with the demon who possesses the pregnant teen who has come with her sister for her regular exorcism session. Michael is so captivated by her predicament that he finds himself drawn into a life and death struggle with the devil whose very existence he denies.\n\nAlthough the movie trailer plays like a high-tech adaptation of "The Exorcist", to which exorcism films will inevitably be compared, there is more spiritual and emotional depth to director Mikael Hafstrom's work than Blatty's. "The Rite" more closely resembles the cinematic subtlety and theological accuracy of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", according to Fr. Gary Thomas, the priest from the book on which the film is based. Michael is a sympathetic character and the film's dramatic exposition of the tragic origins of his faith crisis help the audience sympathize with him as he confronts demons both within and without his tortured soul. Even eccentric Father Lucas, played compellingly by Hopkins is more vivid than the ghostly older priest in "The Exorcist", yet the pairing of priests to defeat Satan is a familiar theme. Fr Lucas even makes a sarcastic reference to "The Exorcist" telling Michael, "You'll see no spinning heads and pea soup here!" What will enliven Catholic viewers is the authenticity of the phenomena of the exorcisms and the splendor of the priesthood when contrasted against the darkness of pure evil. Special effects enhance but do not overpower this compelling thriller and magnificent architecture of Rome augments the timelessness of the story. \n\nFor the many fans of the book by AP journalist Matt Baglio, on which the film is loosely based, screenwriter Michael Petroni has respected the basic story while raising the emotional stakes to great dramatic effect when combined with excellent cinematography and the masterful presence of Anthony Hopkins. Priests who watched the film in the theater with me had a positive reaction but pointed the following theological errors; as a deacon, Michael could not give absolution as he appears to do in the case of the dying woman, and that an inexperienced priest with emotional wounds and of questionable faith would never be chosen to become an exorcist. Too many weaknesses for Satan to exploit, they explained. The manifestations of possession (vomiting nails and frogs, unearthly voices, superhuman strength and knowledge of inner weaknesses) are absolutely accurate, according to Fr Gary Thomas, the real priest from Baglio's book, who had a less dramatic change of heart about the existence of Satan. When I asked him in an interview whether he believed that the devil was a being he responded, "I believed when I met him". \n\nFor older teens and up for frightening and macabre scenes, appropriate but vivid sexual innuendo (verbal references to incest and rape) and foul language. This film is best seen with parental supervision.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92565,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When it was on general release in the cinema, I gave it a wide berth.  I can't remember why, probably the combination of a weak title, Alec Baldwin in a starring role and a really unimaginative trailer. I've just seen it on a 14-inch TV screen and am so sorry I didn't catch it on the big screen (or even a 26-inch TV!).\n\nDavid Mamet can write but he knows his place! This is an action adventure movie and so Mamet is not trying to make any great philosophical point. He does provide a wide variety of thematic ingredients (man V nature, youth V age, brains V brawn, machismo, infidelity) to ensure that the story line is far more interesting than most of Hollywood's action-movie schlock. And, of course, a furry killing machine that can smell a man from 10 miles and run through the forest at 30 mph!\n\nCharles, (Anthony Hopkins' erudite billionaire character) starts out as the vulnerable, isolated character of the film.  He's married to Mickey, his photo-model wife(Elle can act herself!) flirts quite openly with Bob the handsome, younger photographer (Baldwin). Charles seems set up for a fall. In his self-effacing way, he confesses to knowing a lot "in theory" but not being great at "practical application".\n\nSo when the plane crashes into an icy lake, Charles is the one for whom you most fear but that's when all the surprises start..........\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me is that a fine actor such as Harold Perrineau finds himself playing a role that is a classical Hollywood cliché, the nice black guy who gets killed.  When are they going to cut this crap out?  Either kill the guy in the crash or give him a character but don't just make him plot fodder.  Seeing Stephen (Perrineau) with the other two on the lake shore, you just knew he would have all the longevity in this film as James Bond's first female conquest.  As David Mamet doesn't share the writing credits with a studio committee or an executive producer, I suppose he has to take responsibility.\n\nThat said, this is a really gripping film.  Well directed photographed and acted (even by Baldwin!). And the bear!  How long do you have?\n\nThe shots where you (from Charles point of view) are staring down the roaring bear's throat and can see his uvula through an emerging cloud of steamy breath are just brilliant.  I could almost smell that bear. I believe they made extensive use of prosthetics.  Excellent FX!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69318,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When it was on general release in the cinema, I gave it a wide berth.  I can't remember why, probably the combination of a weak title, Alec Baldwin in a starring role and a really unimaginative trailer. I've just seen it on a 14-inch TV screen and am so sorry I didn't catch it on the big screen (or even a 26-inch TV!).\n\nDavid Mamet can write but he knows his place! This is an action adventure movie and so Mamet is not trying to make any great philosophical point. He does provide a wide variety of thematic ingredients (man V nature, youth V age, brains V brawn, machismo, infidelity) to ensure that the story line is far more interesting than most of Hollywood's action-movie schlock. And, of course, a furry killing machine that can smell a man from 10 miles and run through the forest at 30 mph!\n\nCharles, (Anthony Hopkins' erudite billionaire character) starts out as the vulnerable, isolated character of the film.  He's married to Mickey, his photo-model wife(Elle can act herself!) flirts quite openly with Bob the handsome, younger photographer (Baldwin). Charles seems set up for a fall. In his self-effacing way, he confesses to knowing a lot "in theory" but not being great at "practical application".\n\nSo when the plane crashes into an icy lake, Charles is the one for whom you most fear but that's when all the surprises start..........\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me is that a fine actor such as Harold Perrineau finds himself playing a role that is a classical Hollywood cliché, the nice black guy who gets killed.  When are they going to cut this crap out?  Either kill the guy in the crash or give him a character but don't just make him plot fodder.  Seeing Stephen (Perrineau) with the other two on the lake shore, you just knew he would have all the longevity in this film as James Bond's first female conquest.  As David Mamet doesn't share the writing credits with a studio committee or an executive producer, I suppose he has to take responsibility.\n\nThat said, this is a really gripping film.  Well directed photographed and acted (even by Baldwin!). And the bear!  How long do you have?\n\nThe shots where you (from Charles point of view) are staring down the roaring bear's throat and can see his uvula through an emerging cloud of steamy breath are just brilliant.  I could almost smell that bear. I believe they made extensive use of prosthetics.  Excellent FX!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69318,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Movie goers tend to fall into one of two groups when it comes to Johnny Depp – big fans or denigrators. Whichever side of the line you fall, there are few actors who can claim such a diverse career of on screen characters ranging from Edward Scissorhands to Gilbert Grape; from Donnie Brasco to Captain Jack Sparrow; from Willy Wonka to Sweeney Todd; and from John Dillinger to Tonto. Depp now turns his talents towards one of the most unsympathetic real life characters imaginable   South Boston's infamous crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger.\n\nDirector Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) proves yet again that he is an actor's director, rather than a visual technician or story addict. In this adaptation of the book from "Boston Globe" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, Cooper has Depp and Joel Edgerton as his two leads, and an incredibly deep supporting cast that provide the look and feel for this period piece dramatizing the crime and corruption during Bulger's reign.\n\nWhen one thinks of the memorable kingpins of crime/gangster movies, those that come to mind include Michael Corleone (The Godfather movies), Tony Montana (Scarface), Jimmy Conway (Goodfellas), and Frank Costello (The Departed). The Costello character was supposedly partially inspired by Bulger. What made each of these characters fascinating to watch was the insight we were given into the psychological make-up of each and the inner-workings of their organization. And that's the disappointment of Cooper's film.\n\nFor the Whitey Bulger story, there are two distinct directions to explore: the building of Bulger's criminal empire, or the motivation of the FBI Agent John Connolly (Edgerton) as he juggled his job and relationship with Bulger. Unfortunately, the approach here is to show a hand full of cold-blooded murders to prove Bulger's management style, and a few FBI meetings that show the obvious uncertainty within the agency. Rather than a muddled mash-up, a more interesting movie would have chosen a path and dug in deeply.\n\nDespite the story issues, it is fun to watch how Depp and Edgerton tackle their roles. Under heavy make-up (wrinkles, receding hairline, hillbilly teeth, and crazy contact lenses), Depp becomes the intimidating force of Whitey Bulger. Just as impressive is Edgerton as Agent Connolly, as we witness the Southie neighborhood boys all grown up, but still playing cops and robbers   and it remains difficult to tell who the good guys from the bad. Edgerton's cockiness and strutting capture the ego and ambition necessary for a federal agent to bend so many rules. In fact, despite the vastly different approaches, it's not entirely clear which of these two fellows possesses the greatest ambition.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother who became a State Senator. We get very few scenes featuring the brothers, and in fact, Cumberbath's best scenes are instead shared with Edgerton. It's difficult not to chuckle at their first meeting in a restaurant as we watch a Brit and Aussie talk it out with south Boston accents. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott play Edgerton's fellow FBI agents, while Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane (especially good) and W Earl Brown make terrific Bulger crew members. Peter Sarsgaard leaves quite the impression as a doped-up associate, while Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple provide the film's minimal female presence. Corey Stoll storms onto the screen as a Federal Prosecutor who is not amused by the relationship between Connolly and Bulger, but this movie belongs to Depp and Edgerton.\n\nThe concern is that any viewer not already familiar with the Whitey Bulger story may find the story not overly interesting, despite the terrific performances. Fortunately, this viewer was mesmerized by last year's exceptional documentary entitled Whitey: United States of America v James J Bulger   a must see for anyone who wants full details into the Bulger reign of crime and terror, as well as his 20 years on the lam.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170539,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.\n\nI really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252665,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Words like: Excellence, entertainment, larger than life and Sean Connery. These words basically summarize the entire film from my point of view of course because in my opinion (which I don't expect people to agree with) this is the best gangster film there is. Obviously people aren't going to agree because people prefer the likes of the operatic Godfather trilogy or the ultra realistic Goodfellas but in my head The Untouchables is the best.\n\nHere are a few reasons why. First reason is that The Untouchables is just so darn entertaining. All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables. That does not mean, however, that The Untouchables is just some half baked action comedy. No. There is genuine emotion and real story in this film. The story is, as most people know, loosely based on the actual events during the prohibition era in USA in the 1920s (the story is also based very, very loosely on the series that go by the same name) which to some extent means that what we see on the screen is real making the characters and general story seem that much more believable. This also adds greatly to the already very high entertainment value of the film because it draws the audience in. To add to the realism of the film the dialog is also very memorable and there are some great one-liners including some of my all time favorites in this film.\n\nThe acting is nothing short of brilliant. This is without a doubt Kevin Costner's best role. Some people have remarked that he seemed stiff and unable to portray the emotion of the character and to that I can only ask: Were we watching the same movie?! He is a hundred percent believable all the way through. In the beginning he seems a bit too much like a square I-wanna-do-some-good kind of character but as the story progresses he really evolves and becomes more and more emotionally involved in what he does. Both in his friends and in the cause. He even bends some of the rules he initially tried so hard to uphold. Brilliant. Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in. Andy Garcia appears in this film in a very limited role as well and he serves his purpose brilliantly. He is the sharpshooter of the group and he is perfectly believable in that part. He doesn't get to say much but what he does get to say is said with as much passion as I have ever heard from him (he seemed a little stale and lifeless in Godfather III). Robert DeNiro is great as Al Capone. He steals every scene he is in and he really brings the larger-than-life quality to the character which is extremely fitting. The film's best performance belongs to Sean Connery though. The film is for lack of a better expression a Sean Connery tour-de-force. Not only does he steal every scene he is in but he also brings the certain indescribable something to the character that he always does and in every situation you feel with him (as you do in all his films whether he is a villain or a hero). He also got a well deserved Oscar for his performance. People have claimed that the Oscar wasn't as much for this particular performance but an Oscar in recognition of his contributions to the film industry. This belittles his performance which I can safely say is the best of his career and one of the best displays of acting that I have ever seen.\n\nThe film also has a memorable score made by the legendary Ennio Morricone who is perhaps best known for the work he did with the equally legendary western director Sergio Leone (who doesn't know the score from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and in my opinion the score he did for The Untouchables is the best he has ever made. The score is very unlike most scores from the 80s which does that the film doesn't feel like an 80s film as much as Scarface which I find inferior to this masterpiece. The score is grand and epic just like the story and the effects. For an 80s movie the effects are pretty amazing. Once again everything works.\n\nAll in all The Untouchables is a riveting story which is highly recommendable to all fans of crime/gangster movies.\n\n10/10 - on my top 10 of best films","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288183,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This belittles his performance which I can safely say is the best of his career and one of the best displays of acting that I have ever seen.\n\nThe film also has a memorable score made by the legendary Ennio Morricone who is perhaps best known for the work he did with the equally legendary western director Sergio Leone (who doesn't know the score from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and in my opinion the score he did for The Untouchables is the best he has ever made. The score is very unlike most scores from the 80s which does that the film doesn't feel like an 80s film as much as Scarface which I find inferior to this masterpiece. The score is grand and epic just like the story and the effects. For an 80s movie the effects are pretty amazing. Once again everything works.\n\nAll in all The Untouchables is a riveting story which is highly recommendable to all fans of crime/gangster movies.\n\n10/10 - on my top 10 of best films","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288183,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Words like: Excellence, entertainment, larger than life and Sean Connery. These words basically summarize the entire film from my point of view of course because in my opinion (which I don't expect people to agree with) this is the best gangster film there is. Obviously people aren't going to agree because people prefer the likes of the operatic Godfather trilogy or the ultra realistic Goodfellas but in my head The Untouchables is the best.\n\nHere are a few reasons why. First reason is that The Untouchables is just so darn entertaining. All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables. That does not mean, however, that The Untouchables is just some half baked action comedy. No. There is genuine emotion and real story in this film. The story is, as most people know, loosely based on the actual events during the prohibition era in USA in the 1920s (the story is also based very, very loosely on the series that go by the same name) which to some extent means that what we see on the screen is real making the characters and general story seem that much more believable. This also adds greatly to the already very high entertainment value of the film because it draws the audience in. To add to the realism of the film the dialog is also very memorable and there are some great one-liners including some of my all time favorites in this film.\n\nThe acting is nothing short of brilliant. This is without a doubt Kevin Costner's best role. Some people have remarked that he seemed stiff and unable to portray the emotion of the character and to that I can only ask: Were we watching the same movie?! He is a hundred percent believable all the way through. In the beginning he seems a bit too much like a square I-wanna-do-some-good kind of character but as the story progresses he really evolves and becomes more and more emotionally involved in what he does. Both in his friends and in the cause. He even bends some of the rules he initially tried so hard to uphold. Brilliant. Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in. Andy Garcia appears in this film in a very limited role as well and he serves his purpose brilliantly. He is the sharpshooter of the group and he is perfectly believable in that part. He doesn't get to say much but what he does get to say is said with as much passion as I have ever heard from him (he seemed a little stale and lifeless in Godfather III). Robert DeNiro is great as Al Capone. He steals every scene he is in and he really brings the larger-than-life quality to the character which is extremely fitting. The film's best performance belongs to Sean Connery though. The film is for lack of a better expression a Sean Connery tour-de-force. Not only does he steal every scene he is in but he also brings the certain indescribable something to the character that he always does and in every situation you feel with him (as you do in all his films whether he is a villain or a hero). He also got a well deserved Oscar for his performance. People have claimed that the Oscar wasn't as much for this particular performance but an Oscar in recognition of his contributions to the film industry. This belittles his performance which I can safely say is the best of his career and one of the best displays of acting that I have ever seen.\n\nThe film also has a memorable score made by the legendary Ennio Morricone who is perhaps best known for the work he did with the equally legendary western director Sergio Leone (who doesn't know the score from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and in my opinion the score he did for The Untouchables is the best he has ever made.

Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.\n\nI really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252665,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Movie goers tend to fall into one of two groups when it comes to Johnny Depp – big fans or denigrators. Whichever side of the line you fall, there are few actors who can claim such a diverse career of on screen characters ranging from Edward Scissorhands to Gilbert Grape; from Donnie Brasco to Captain Jack Sparrow; from Willy Wonka to Sweeney Todd; and from John Dillinger to Tonto. Depp now turns his talents towards one of the most unsympathetic real life characters imaginable   South Boston's infamous crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger.\n\nDirector Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) proves yet again that he is an actor's director, rather than a visual technician or story addict. In this adaptation of the book from "Boston Globe" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, Cooper has Depp and Joel Edgerton as his two leads, and an incredibly deep supporting cast that provide the look and feel for this period piece dramatizing the crime and corruption during Bulger's reign.\n\nWhen one thinks of the memorable kingpins of crime/gangster movies, those that come to mind include Michael Corleone (The Godfather movies), Tony Montana (Scarface), Jimmy Conway (Goodfellas), and Frank Costello (The Departed). The Costello character was supposedly partially inspired by Bulger. What made each of these characters fascinating to watch was the insight we were given into the psychological make-up of each and the inner-workings of their organization. And that's the disappointment of Cooper's film.\n\nFor the Whitey Bulger story, there are two distinct directions to explore: the building of Bulger's criminal empire, or the motivation of the FBI Agent John Connolly (Edgerton) as he juggled his job and relationship with Bulger. Unfortunately, the approach here is to show a hand full of cold-blooded murders to prove Bulger's management style, and a few FBI meetings that show the obvious uncertainty within the agency. Rather than a muddled mash-up, a more interesting movie would have chosen a path and dug in deeply.\n\nDespite the story issues, it is fun to watch how Depp and Edgerton tackle their roles. Under heavy make-up (wrinkles, receding hairline, hillbilly teeth, and crazy contact lenses), Depp becomes the intimidating force of Whitey Bulger. Just as impressive is Edgerton as Agent Connolly, as we witness the Southie neighborhood boys all grown up, but still playing cops and robbers   and it remains difficult to tell who the good guys from the bad. Edgerton's cockiness and strutting capture the ego and ambition necessary for a federal agent to bend so many rules. In fact, despite the vastly different approaches, it's not entirely clear which of these two fellows possesses the greatest ambition.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother who became a State Senator. We get very few scenes featuring the brothers, and in fact, Cumberbath's best scenes are instead shared with Edgerton. It's difficult not to chuckle at their first meeting in a restaurant as we watch a Brit and Aussie talk it out with south Boston accents. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott play Edgerton's fellow FBI agents, while Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane (especially good) and W Earl Brown make terrific Bulger crew members. Peter Sarsgaard leaves quite the impression as a doped-up associate, while Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple provide the film's minimal female presence. Corey Stoll storms onto the screen as a Federal Prosecutor who is not amused by the relationship between Connolly and Bulger, but this movie belongs to Depp and Edgerton.\n\nThe concern is that any viewer not already familiar with the Whitey Bulger story may find the story not overly interesting, despite the terrific performances. Fortunately, this viewer was mesmerized by last year's exceptional documentary entitled Whitey: United States of America v James J Bulger   a must see for anyone who wants full details into the Bulger reign of crime and terror, as well as his 20 years on the lam.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170539,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of my favourite movies it also provides the Rocky pump, as in like Rocky it has the emotion both in action and through the films music and the fighting makes you want to get up and starting punching and kicking anything! and you don't get that sort of feeling with many films. Rocky had it and Bloodsport has it, and if a fighting film makes you get up and fight your living room wall then its a winner! Van Damme is excellent, his fighting manoeuvres are breathtaking, the range of different styles of fighters is great and well know martial artist Bolo Yeung's destruction of all opponents is wonderfully filmed, and as Van Dammes main contender we have a great adventure. All the fighters give great performances and the fighting scenes are superb. Great performance from big Donald Gibb as the hilarious Ray Jackson. His running punch on his first opponent is worth watching for that alone! Donald Gibb is excellent and brings humour to the role as well as some excellent and sometimes hilarious no nonsense fighting! The story too is superb, the kumite bringing the worlds greatest fighters together and by invitation only and the location also brilliant. Hiden in the depths of Hong Kong badlands. A winner in all departments. I remember watching this with friends and going out in the garden for some Bloodsport kicking and punching well not each other, thin air! but it makes you feel alive. Not many films do that. 10/10 for me.

Van Damme is excellent, his fighting manoeuvres are breathtaking, the range of different styles of fighters is great and well know martial artist Bolo Yeung's destruction of all opponents is wonderfully filmed, and as Van Dammes main contender we have a great adventure. All the fighters give great performances and the fighting scenes are superb. Great performance from big Donald Gibb as the hilarious Ray Jackson. His running punch on his first opponent is worth watching for that alone! Donald Gibb is excellent and brings humour to the role as well as some excellent and sometimes hilarious no nonsense fighting! The story too is superb, the kumite bringing the worlds greatest fighters together and by invitation only and the location also brilliant. Hiden in the depths of Hong Kong badlands. A winner in all departments. I remember watching this with friends and going out in the garden for some Bloodsport kicking and punching well not each other, thin air! but it makes you feel alive. Not many films do that. 10/10 for me. Fantastic film!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":78762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Back in the late 1990's the TV show was at its height and tapping into the shared fears of the day: fear of the unknown, fear of the impending millennium, and fear that something larger than us (the government or alien invaders) was up to no good. Flash forward to the year 2008 and we know all that hubbub about the millennium was for nothing, our government has been up to no good for years, and it's not space invaders we need to worry about but other people terrorizing us. The murky, gloomy, grim style of "The X-Files" is now the norm with feverish and dark films like "There Will Be Blood" and "The Dark Knight" tapping into the mindset of culture today from opposite ends of the film spectrum.\n\nApparently creator Chris Carter didn't realize his baby was irrelevant now. His only mission should've been to please the faithful. If he wanted to revive his series on film, he had best stick to the labyrinthine alien mythology that still has some die-hard fans buzzing, or at the very least deliver a fun stand-alone monster-of-the-week style flick that would make fans jump in their seats. With "The X-Files: I Want to Believe" he does neither of those things. Instead, he gives us a story where Mulder and Scully come out of hiding to work on a case where the FBI are using a psychic criminal priest to help locate a missing agent and track down a potential serial killer. The plot fits more into the mold of his far less popular companion series "Millennium" than it does to "The X-Files." Apparently Carter wanted to please no one except perhaps himself.\n\nThe weirdest thing about the film is that it isn't all that bad. Carter as a director lays on some decent atmosphere (with all the global-warming defying snow and some eerie nighttime shots) and creates some palpable tension as the horrors of the case grow grimmer. The chemistry between Mulder (a lazy but effective David Duchovny) and Scully (an amazingly fully ranged and emotional Gillian Anderson) is still there, and Anderson's performance is especially gripping. Billy Connolly, cast against type, gives an interesting turn as the corrupted priest searching for redemption through his visions that probably would've garnered an Emmy nod had this been a very special two-part TV episode. Also good is Amanda Peet, looking smashing in her smart FBI pantsuits.\n\nMost interesting is the story arc given Dana Scully. I honestly had stopped watching the show after the sixth season, and aside from the mythology storyline that built up to the first film released ten years ago, I recall some of my favorite episodes being the ones where Scully questioned her faith and struggled with reconciling her Catholicism with her scientific approach to the paranormal investigations. This is again explored here, as Scully, always the skeptic, so desperately wants to believe in something. However, it's an odd choice for Carter to focus on this internal human drama when he should be focusing on how to bring fans back into the fold. It would've been an interesting and compelling layer had Carter not been so inept with the rest of the plot.\n\nIn the end some fine performances and a moody atmosphere do not add up to a good time. Eventually it becomes an uncomfortable and anachronistic creep-fest that plays like the type of suspense thriller that ruled the roost in the mid-1990's after films like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven" made police detection and serial killing popular entertainment. Well, it's 2008, Mr. Carter, and it's time to wake up from your prolonged nightmare that was rendered uninteresting in 2001.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89284,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If he wanted to revive his series on film, he had best stick to the labyrinthine alien mythology that still has some die-hard fans buzzing, or at the very least deliver a fun stand-alone monster-of-the-week style flick that would make fans jump in their seats. With "The X-Files: I Want to Believe" he does neither of those things. Instead, he gives us a story where Mulder and Scully come out of hiding to work on a case where the FBI are using a psychic criminal priest to help locate a missing agent and track down a potential serial killer. The plot fits more into the mold of his far less popular companion series "Millennium" than it does to "The X-Files." Apparently Carter wanted to please no one except perhaps himself.\n\nThe weirdest thing about the film is that it isn't all that bad. Carter as a director lays on some decent atmosphere (with all the global-warming defying snow and some eerie nighttime shots) and creates some palpable tension as the horrors of the case grow grimmer. The chemistry between Mulder (a lazy but effective David Duchovny) and Scully (an amazingly fully ranged and emotional Gillian Anderson) is still there, and Anderson's performance is especially gripping. Billy Connolly, cast against type, gives an interesting turn as the corrupted priest searching for redemption through his visions that probably would've garnered an Emmy nod had this been a very special two-part TV episode. Also good is Amanda Peet, looking smashing in her smart FBI pantsuits.\n\nMost interesting is the story arc given Dana Scully. I honestly had stopped watching the show after the sixth season, and aside from the mythology storyline that built up to the first film released ten years ago, I recall some of my favorite episodes being the ones where Scully questioned her faith and struggled with reconciling her Catholicism with her scientific approach to the paranormal investigations. This is again explored here, as Scully, always the skeptic, so desperately wants to believe in something. However, it's an odd choice for Carter to focus on this internal human drama when he should be focusing on how to bring fans back into the fold. It would've been an interesting and compelling layer had Carter not been so inept with the rest of the plot.\n\nIn the end some fine performances and a moody atmosphere do not add up to a good time. Eventually it becomes an uncomfortable and anachronistic creep-fest that plays like the type of suspense thriller that ruled the roost in the mid-1990's after films like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven" made police detection and serial killing popular entertainment. Well, it's 2008, Mr. Carter, and it's time to wake up from your prolonged nightmare that was rendered uninteresting in 2001.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89284,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Planet ima čak tri nevjerovatno vrela sunca, ali svake 22 godine na njega se spušta potpuna tama te na njegovu površinu izlaze gigantska čudovišta u potrazi za hranom. Kako upravo Riddick ima hirurški poboljšane oči, koje mu omogućuju jasno vidjeti i u mraku, postaje jasno kako je baš on najveća nada zalutalima da se dočepaju svemirskog broda i napuste opasan planet.</desc>

An award winning film at Sundance, this one seems to carry the same polarizing effect that "Tree of Life" does. The reviews and comments have been discordant and contentious. After sitting through a Q&amp;A with Mike Cahill (co-writer, director) and Brit Marling (co-writer, star) I am guessing they are taking great pride in the love/hate responses. Their film was designed to take you deep ... make you think and self-analyze. This is not a fluffy Owen Wilson rom-com. Explaining what it is, well, that's a challenge.\n\nThe story begins with Rhoda (Brit Marling) out for a night of partying. We learn she has been accepted to M.I.T. and that she is quite the space and astronomy lover. Her very poor decision to drive home after drinking results in a horrific accident that changes her life and that of a young family. At the same time, scientists discover "another Earth" has been hiding on the other side of the sun. Flash forward four years as Rhoda is released from prison.\n\nShe is a broken spirit whose bright future has been dashed. She tracks down the man who survived the crash she caused and has every intention of apologizing. Instead, she cleans his house. She finds John (William Mapother) has dropped out of society and found numbness in the bottle.\n\nI won't say more about the story because it is really something to watch unfold. What I will say is that I found the advertisements to be somewhat misleading. This is not a sci-fi film per se. Sure the second earth brings about numerous questions concerning the "other" us. What would we say? How would we react? Have I done better there than here? But that is actually an underlying element to this story ... always present in our thoughts and those of Rhoda. Instead, this film is a psychological drama. And a dark one at that.\n\nYou will recognize William Mapother (The Grudge, Lost), who plays John. He has a regular guy look to him and stretches well from happiness to depression to, once again, showing a spark. Brit Marling is one you don't know, but will soon enough. She is an amazing presence on screen and avoids the Hollywood acting crutches. She plays Rhoda as the damaged, confused creature she is in the story. Very well done.\n\nA couple of other interesting notes include Kumar Pallana (The Royal Tenenbaums)as Purdeep. With minimal screen time, his character provides Rhoda with a lesson she needs. There is also a scene where John plays a saw as a musical instrument. The sound is amazing and the music is actually from Natalia Paruz, who is knows as the "saw lady". Other music in the film is outstanding and courtesy of Fall on Your Sword. Very unique, but a perfect fit for the film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92285,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

An award winning film at Sundance, this one seems to carry the same polarizing effect that "Tree of Life" does. The reviews and comments have been discordant and contentious. After sitting through a Q&amp;A with Mike Cahill (co-writer, director) and Brit Marling (co-writer, star) I am guessing they are taking great pride in the love/hate responses. Their film was designed to take you deep ... make you think and self-analyze. This is not a fluffy Owen Wilson rom-com. Explaining what it is, well, that's a challenge.\n\nThe story begins with Rhoda (Brit Marling) out for a night of partying. We learn she has been accepted to M.I.T. and that she is quite the space and astronomy lover. Her very poor decision to drive home after drinking results in a horrific accident that changes her life and that of a young family. At the same time, scientists discover "another Earth" has been hiding on the other side of the sun. Flash forward four years as Rhoda is released from prison.\n\nShe is a broken spirit whose bright future has been dashed. She tracks down the man who survived the crash she caused and has every intention of apologizing. Instead, she cleans his house. She finds John (William Mapother) has dropped out of society and found numbness in the bottle.\n\nI won't say more about the story because it is really something to watch unfold. What I will say is that I found the advertisements to be somewhat misleading. This is not a sci-fi film per se. Sure the second earth brings about numerous questions concerning the "other" us. What would we say? How would we react? Have I done better there than here? But that is actually an underlying element to this story ... always present in our thoughts and those of Rhoda. Instead, this film is a psychological drama. And a dark one at that.\n\nYou will recognize William Mapother (The Grudge, Lost), who plays John. He has a regular guy look to him and stretches well from happiness to depression to, once again, showing a spark. Brit Marling is one you don't know, but will soon enough. She is an amazing presence on screen and avoids the Hollywood acting crutches. She plays Rhoda as the damaged, confused creature she is in the story. Very well done.\n\nA couple of other interesting notes include Kumar Pallana (The Royal Tenenbaums)as Purdeep. With minimal screen time, his character provides Rhoda with a lesson she needs. There is also a scene where John plays a saw as a musical instrument. The sound is amazing and the music is actually from Natalia Paruz, who is knows as the "saw lady". Other music in the film is outstanding and courtesy of Fall on Your Sword. Very unique, but a perfect fit for the film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92285,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Grenvile sada vodi dućan zajedno sa svojim veselim i zgodnim sinom Lirojem, koji se rodio iz kratkog ljubavnog susreta od pre dvadesetak godina. Grenvile je i dalje na usluzi zajednici na svoj neponovljivi način. Željan zarade, Grenvile smišlja razne nepromišljene planove za podsticanje kupaca da ostave što više novca, ali retko kad postiže očekivane rezultate. Liroju ne nedostaje ženske pažnje, a Grenvilovo udvaranje staroj ljubavi Mavis stalno ometa njena žestoko zaštitnička sestra Madž. Tu je i uvek prisutna Crna Udovica, koja je takođe bacila oko na Grenvila, čini se.</desc>

Tim čine: Tobi Kurtis (Eddie Kaye Thomas), fini bihevioralista; Hapi Kin (Jadyn Wong) vunderkind za mehaniku i Silvester Dod (Ari Stidham), odličan statističar. Iako se međusobno odlično razumiju, vanjski svijet je za njih zagonetka. Srećom, Pejdž Dinin (Katharine McPhee) ima mladog sina koji će ih "prevesti" u vanjski svijet. Svi pobjeđuju s ovim timom: svojom izuzetnom domišljatošću rješavaju nacionalne krize, pomažući sebi da se uklope u stvarni svijet.</desc>

Umoran od života u Emmitovoj sjeni, Ray je proćelav, debeljuškast socijalni radnik koji je silno ogorčen kartama koje su mu podijeljene, a za to okrivljuje brata. Njihovo bratsko suparništvo vodi ih na krivi put koji počinje sitnim krađama, ali ubrzo dovodi do ubistava, mafijaša i surovog natjecateljskog bridža. Sitno suparništvo između dvojice braće eskalira i donosi haos maloj minesotskoj zajednici.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

I couldn't wait until the next episodes. I talked to several friends each week to prolong the pleasure. In a world fun of shamefully silly and dumb programming, my hat is off to FX.I hope this show returns. The ending left it wide open for answers. I can't wait until it comes back. Glenn Close was perfectly cast as the villain; the character you love to hate. I was surprised at the wonderful acting by so many actors I had not seen and the ensemble of the cast was perfect.Why can't there be more shows with the depth and suspense? Is there any way to let fans know if this series will continue?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28223,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Grenvile je i dalje na usluzi zajednici na svoj neponovljivi način. Željan zarade, Grenvile smišlja razne nepromišljene planove za podsticanje kupaca da ostave što više novca, ali retko kad postiže očekivane rezultate.

Serija se temelji na istinitoj priči i prati genija Voltera O'Brajena (Elyes Gabel) i njegovog tima sjajnih čudesa koji se bore protiv složenih visokotehnoloških prijetnji modernog vremena. Tim čine: Tobi Kurtis (Eddie Kaye Thomas), fini bihevioralista; Hapi Kin (Jadyn Wong) vunderkind za mehaniku i Silvester Dod (Ari Stidham), odličan statističar. Iako se međusobno odlično razumiju, vanjski svijet je za njih zagonetka. Srećom, Pejdž Dinin (Katharine McPhee) ima mladog sina koji će ih "prevesti" u vanjski svijet. Svi pobjeđuju s ovim timom: svojom izuzetnom domišljatošću rješavaju nacionalne krize, pomažući sebi da se uklope u stvarni svijet.</desc>

Umoran od života u Emmitovoj sjeni, Ray je proćelav, debeljuškast socijalni radnik koji je silno ogorčen kartama koje su mu podijeljene, a za to okrivljuje brata. Njihovo bratsko suparništvo vodi ih na krivi put koji počinje sitnim krađama, ali ubrzo dovodi do ubistava, mafijaša i surovog natjecateljskog bridža. Sitno suparništvo između dvojice braće eskalira i donosi haos maloj minesotskoj zajednici.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>
