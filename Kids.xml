U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

It always seemed a bit too close in plot to No Strings Attached (made extra odd as the female leads Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman had literally just starred together in Black Swan), a film that came out less than six months ago, and while the trailers looked amusing, they seemed to look a little too close to an atypical romantic comedy. But the film actually ended up surprising me. Well, the first half at least.\n\nJamie (Kunis) is a headhunter in New York City who helps aspiring graphic design artist Dylan (Justin Timberlake) land a prestigious job at GQ. They become good friends, and after a discussion about their relationship failures, decide to start having sex without the relationship schmaltz (hence the titular phrase). But the good times cannot stay uncomplicated for long.\n\nRather surprisingly, the first half of Friends with Benefits is a ridiculously raunchy sex comedy that is sweeter than it is crude. The dialogue and one-liners drop at a steady pace, and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments. I was genuinely surprised at just how much I was enjoying the film, and how well co-writer/director Will Gluck (who knocked Easy A out of the park last year) helped capture the tropes and stereotypes of romantic comedies, and went entirely against them. The scene that starts the initial sexual antics is a complete dissection of the genre, and seeing the film twist and turn around the familiar plot devices was wonderful to see. It made the film feel hilarious, but also made it feel like it was attempting to do something different at the same time. Adding in a couple of random cameos from notable actors was a bit wacky (which the trailers have ruined slightly), but helped add to the humour.\n\nExcept the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic, a lot less sweet, and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer, landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different, and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined, but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.\n\nWhile sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits, Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic (we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that), but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well, does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis, but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player, as opposed to the lead.\n\nKunis on the other hand, is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis, but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script's weakest moments, she grins and pushes forward, never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude, yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her, but it was a scene that made her seemingly-realistic character feel a whole lot less believable.\n\nPatricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins both deliver good performances, but sadly feel like they are just plagiarizing from characters they have played better in the past. Jenna Elfman (who I did not realize was still acting) does a little better in a warm and significantly low-key role as Dylan's sister Annie. But it is Woody Harrelson who steals the entire show as gay sports writer Tommy. He plays the character ridiculously over-the-top, but never feels like he is encroaching on any stereotypes. He makes it his own, and is almost too good in the role. He gets all of the film's best dialogue quips, and runs circles around everyone on screen. In more than one instance, Timberlake looks legitimately shocked at some of the things Harrelson says and gets away with. I think the film could have only benefited from including more of him.\n\nIn the end, Friends with Benefits is both surprisingly well done and unsurprisingly ordinary. It tries so hard initially to be the anti- romantic comedy, and then just ends up falling into the same predictable elements that every other film in the genre has already done countless times before. The film is genuinely hilarious when it wants to be however, and this does save it from being a total waste. But it could have been so much more.\n\n7/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":346372,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some people : Julia Roberts in a romantic comedy could be pretty slushy stuff; but then again if you watch it wanting that sort of thing you're likely to be disappointed.  Yes, so it is romantic and even a bit slushy at times, but has a sharp script and fast pace which keep you amused 95% of the time.\n\nOne of the things which appealed to me was the way moments of melodrama were defused into comedy - check out the two girls' confrontation with an audience of women (gathered by the call "Catfight!") whose oohs and aahs forestall any emotional reaction we ourselves may have to the scene.\n\nSome of the camerawork is also more interesting than one might expect, with particularly powerful close-ups where one or two faces fill the screen. Julia Roberts' beauty comes through in a long shot which starts to look like a shampoo commercial: long curly hair spills around her head as she lies in despair on the floor (the public safety message being, don't ever sit with your back against a door which an irate ex-lover might wrench open at any minute); nevertheless, the proximity gives us an intimacy with her character we might otherwise miss.\n\nAnother effective shot of this kind (two heads on a pillow fill the screen) drives home the theme touched on here of the devastatingly attractive gay man who is made doubly so by his inaccessibility (as more fully explored in "Object of my Affection").  George (Rupert Everett) is a fantastic character whose sense of fun, wisdom, sensitivity and English accent make him every girls' ideal object for unrequited love (or maybe it's just me ).\n\nThe disappointing aspect for me was the film's final affirmation of sexist values and a rather superficial and one-sided view of "real" love - but you 'll have to watch it to see if you agree with me on that.  Basically in my opinion, some of the ending lacked the self-awareness and sharpness of the rest of the film.  However, overall I would recommend it for an amusing and sometimes clever 90 minutes of celluloid.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Balthazar</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Našavši se pred nizom složenih slučajeva ubojstva, nova policijska inspektorica Hélène Bach mora naučiti kako raditi s genijalnim, ali užasavajućim Raphaelom, koji može natjerati mrtve da progovore. Raphael je najtalentiraniji forenzički patolog svoje generacije i ima sve: šarmantan je, zgodan i inteligentan, ali podjednako očarava i razbješnjuje. On ne iskazuje poštovanje i nestašan je te živi punim plućima često zaobilazeći norme i usvojena pravila ponašanja.</desc>

Basic formula is (1) A client has an issue; (2) Bull's team select a jury; (3a) Bull's team noisily express exactly what's happening inside every jury's head with 100% accuracy; (3b) Bull's team struggle and look like they're going to lose; (4) New and compelling evidence is miraculously discovered by Bull's team, frequently showing Police/FBI/etc to be incompetent investigators (although this is not directly addressed); (5) Bull's team wins case while Jason Bull commentates his lawyer's brilliance in whispers.\n\nIt's a very simplistic show, which might appeal if that's what you're after, but could also be really annoying. For example, time scales are completely fictional. Bull's team is always urgently gathering evidence during a trial. They frequently break laws, hack computer systems, and invade people's privacy. ALL of these actions are brushed off as inconsequential and a justified means to an end for their client. His team made up from former employees of the FBI and Homeland Security are idolised as if those organisations are faultless.\n\nEarlier episodes spent considerable time talking about juries, but there's no detail... just someone in a room staring at screens and expressing what are supposedly 100% accurate explanations of what each juror is thinking. Uncertainty is very rare.\n\nI'm not very familiar with trial science but it's hard to imagine that it hits this degree of formulaic perfection. Maybe a disinterest in looking at that is why what is meant to be the main premise of the show is brushed over so superficially. If a show had to be based on trial science, there would be so many interesting things it could focus on: accuracy, ethics, just getting it to work, the list goes on. Bull doesn't. It's just an excessively simplistic legal drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Night at the Museum felt like a pattern to me, no funny parts to little giggles and then the movie would make you laugh so hard.\n\nAll the famous faces really brought charm to the movie and I don't think it would have work well with anyone else.\n\nNight at the Museum is a fun movie worth seeing but not a movie you will be looking back on in 10 years time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":320818,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You've seen the material a thousand times from Freejack to Johnny Mneumonic to Total Recall to Matrix. This echoes both John Carpenter's, "They Live," and the more-recent "Gamer," with some of the feel of the original "Blade," attempted, but never achieved.\n\nThe action is awesome, well choreographed, and professionally executed throughout a Terminator-stylized storyline including the end of the world as we know it via robotics and a mad scientist portrayed disappointingly by Val Kilmer.\n\nMad scientists should be either raving mad, or insidiously fiendish. Kilmer's Virgil was full of high ideas with no moral center, but he utterly lacked the diabolism required to carry through such a plan. It was like he knew from the beginning that he was doomed to fail, and played the character thusly, failing to invest too much of himself in a doomed role. I wanted him to be Madmartigan vs. the kid from Real Genius, and instead, I got Craig Ferguson's Dr. Wagner of Lenny the Wonder Dog. To say the least, I was disappointed.\n\nDecent on a rainy afternoon if there's nothing left in the house to clean.

You've seen the material a thousand times from Freejack to Johnny Mneumonic to Total Recall to Matrix. This echoes both John Carpenter's, "They Live," and the more-recent "Gamer," with some of the feel of the original "Blade," attempted, but never achieved.\n\nThe action is awesome, well choreographed, and professionally executed throughout a Terminator-stylized storyline including the end of the world as we know it via robotics and a mad scientist portrayed disappointingly by Val Kilmer.\n\nMad scientists should be either raving mad, or insidiously fiendish. Kilmer's Virgil was full of high ideas with no moral center, but he utterly lacked the diabolism required to carry through such a plan. It was like he knew from the beginning that he was doomed to fail, and played the character thusly, failing to invest too much of himself in a doomed role. I wanted him to be Madmartigan vs. the kid from Real Genius, and instead, I got Craig Ferguson's Dr. Wagner of Lenny the Wonder Dog. To say the least, I was disappointed.\n\nDecent on a rainy afternoon if there's nothing left in the house to clean. Otherwise, you could find something better to do with your time.\n\nIt rates a 5.5/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So if you haven't already seen his movie, and if you enjoy romantic comedies, then I can more than warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch "The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs".\n\n"The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs" scores a solid six out of ten stars rating from me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It interweaves a really elaborate set-up that you have to focus on to understand.\n\nAlso, for people who think they're sophisticated in camera motion. Think about that space. The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.\n\nJulianne Moore is great, as always.

A thriller on a plane that has you thinking you know all the answers (because we're such expert movie watches), then flips it. Yes, it's a contrived subplot. And the reasoning behind this terrorist act is goofy, BUT...it is a lot of fun. It interweaves a really elaborate set-up that you have to focus on to understand.\n\nAlso, for people who think they're sophisticated in camera motion. Think about that space. The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.\n\nJulianne Moore is great, as always. Neeson is perfect for this role, but one has to wonder how this behemoth of a guy fits in a airplane bathroom.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They say the plots and subplots were disconnected and on loosely held together by a weak premise.\n\nI thought the opposite. I chose to watch it anyway because of the cast. I'll admit none of them had a remarkable performance, award winning or otherwise. I think they were all fairly balanced without overselling any particular role. While the story centered around Sophia primarily, you could sense the desire, intrigue and frustration of the other characters.

Nakon sedam sezona revolucionarnog humora, što bi se zapravo novo moglo dogoditi i postići u osmoj sezoni, a da već nije viđeno? Ovo je sezona koja je dokazala da autori mogu dati još više u seriji ni o čemu, sezona koja je dala najbolje od najboljeg i u kojoj možete ''yada yada yada'' bilo što u životu. Osma sezona definitivno je pokazatelj da je Seinfeld serija, koja i nakon toliko sezona nije dosadila, a sudeći po sve većem broju fanova iz sezone u sezonu vjerojatno niti neće.</desc>

Especially when the review just says it is bad and gives no explanation other than implying there is no plot.\n\nMost of the Arnie movies are not that great, I love them still, this one has a bit more of a story that it is following, with less action. That is probably why every1 is down on it I suppose, it is different.\n\nThere are a couple things going on with the main character, he is trying to get to the bottom of them both. It all unfolds nicely, but it is a bit slower than what most Arnie fans are used to. To me, that is fine.\n\nI do not understand why anyone thinks there is no story, there is more story than action. Could of used more time with the characters, probably was part of what was cut from the original 3 hour run time, but it is still a fine movie. Meaning there are much worse Arnie movies that were more successful. This is like a better version of Eraser, which I thought was only OK back then. Give it a shot, take it as it is without some type of expectations, you will not be disappointed. Unless you are not an Arnie or cop violence fan.

Especially when the review just says it is bad and gives no explanation other than implying there is no plot.\n\nMost of the Arnie movies are not that great, I love them still, this one has a bit more of a story that it is following, with less action. That is probably why every1 is down on it I suppose, it is different.\n\nThere are a couple things going on with the main character, he is trying to get to the bottom of them both. It all unfolds nicely, but it is a bit slower than what most Arnie fans are used to. To me, that is fine.\n\nI do not understand why anyone thinks there is no story, there is more story than action. Could of used more time with the characters, probably was part of what was cut from the original 3 hour run time, but it is still a fine movie. Meaning there are much worse Arnie movies that were more successful. This is like a better version of Eraser, which I thought was only OK back then. Give it a shot, take it as it is without some type of expectations, you will not be disappointed. Unless you are not an Arnie or cop violence fan. If that is the case, then why are you reading this?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And it probably is, but unfortunately 'Child 44' doesn't have what it takes to be a really good film. Some things are well done: the oppressing atmosphere of living in a police state, and the courage it takes to go against of the powers that be, are very convincing.

Only after he exposes the incompetence of the police force in a series of child killings, he gets rehabilitated. \n\nThe weak point of the film is the script. It takes a long while before all elements of the story are clear, and the quick succession of events at the start is a bit confusing. Moreover, the story is spiced up with some action scenes that are not well executed and unnecessary. Also, the tear jerking scene at the end is at odds with the hard-boiled story. \n\nWhat really annoyed me (and I think I'm not alone) is the language. The actors speak English with a mock Russian accent. This half-hearted way of solving a language problem makes some dialogue almost ridiculous. Just let them speak normal English. I know, that makes the film a bit less authentic. But nobody spoke English with mock Russian accents in Soviet Russia.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67388,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So he will travel to Earth from the Mars colony where he was born. \n\nAlso starring: Gary Oldman, Carla Gugino, and B.D. Wong, because even the coolest teenagers need some adults around.\n\n"The Space Between Us" rides on the current wave of Young Adult, or YA for short, novels and movies which has dowsed the cinemas for the last ten years or so. \n\nIt's still about romance, some sci-fi and action like the most of them (or at least the most popular of them) but it brings some refreshing changes to the menu.\n\nIt's based on an original screenplay and not novel. It offers sci-fi and action without relying on done to death YA clichés (dystopian society, dating or fighting supernatural beings, etc). It puts characters in real danger so you can't always predict whether everybody's gonna make it. It doesn't have clear-cut good and bad guys...\n\nAnd last but by far not least, the movie has a nice classic Steven Spielberg-ian feel which puts the sense of wonder and adventure back to sci-fi which, in my humble opinion, is often missing or buried under all those visual effects and pizazz setpieces. \n\nEven good old Spielberg himself is not always able to pull it off: the movie makes you actually care about the characters because there's a real human backbone to the story. It's entertainment but it also has heart.\n\nAll this rests very much on the lead man Asa Butterfield who was 18 during the filming and turns 20 this April. \n\nFormer child star of "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", Scorsese's "Hugo" and "Ender's Game" fame, this guy has grown to become a fine young actor indeed. \n\nI very much enjoyed his soft but sure performance as an innocent and fragile alien braving the world unknown to him. He has found a seemingly perfect balance between strange, childlike and soulful that the role asks of him, and I'd be glad to see him getting some awards or nominations for this standout work. \n\nHe even has this memorable, Pinocchio-ish appearance and style of moving which seems suitable for a person not used to Earth's gravity.\n\nThe other characters stay more in the background, so this turns out to be Asa Butterfield's show, and he more than fulfills the promise. \n\nThe next most interesting performance comes from Oldman who ventures in the land of brashness and theatricality, in a good way. The aging thespian hasn't offered this kind of colorfulness for quite some time (in a big movie, at least) and I enjoyed it to the point of feeling that his character was underused. Holding him in the background makes sense in the context of a whole story, though.\n\nIf you find my score surprisingly high, please remember that it's made for a YA crowd, or at least a teenager in all of us. I would not recommend it alongside 8 out of 10 movies made for older viewer groups. Probably.\n\nBut 8 is not too generous. I liked "Space" very much and its overall quality more than compensates a shallow story which surely would work better longer. This could be a bona fide modern classic if the characters and events had more room to develop and breathe. Maybe in the form of (mini-)series or something.\n\nIf you like "The Space Between Us" and look for something similar to watch, I would recommend 2014's "The Fault in Our Stars" for moving YA story, or 2015's "Tomorrowland" as an uneven but good example of how to combine sci-fi and action in a YA movie.\n\nI choose to end this review with an off-topic anecdote which I just happen to like very much:\n\nQ: Why did astronaut leave his wife?

So, I checked out what people were saying, and having read so many mixed reviews on it, I had to see it for myself. I love scary movies...always have.  And I'm a particular fan of any movie that can bring back that feeling of terror one experiences as a child...whether from watching movies, or fearing the ever-present monsters in the closet.  At times, this movie was able to do that.\n\nDarkness starts out strong, grabbing you in out of sheer morbid curiosity.

Plus: the amazing sceneries of Calgary and a shout-out to the crew for doing a great job in creating the perfect backdrops.\n\nSo, I do.

A life impacting movie","reviewBody":"Is there anything more that can be truly said of this inspiring movie? Possibly it is the most unlikely hit movie that has generated a strong faithful following.\n\nI rewatched it after 30 years on the back of falling for the Cobra Kai series, and loved it every bit as much as when I first saw it. I'm much older but find so many new things to relate to and remind myself of in life.\n\nThe premise of the film is simple, but it is almost impossible to explain the impact this movie had on a certain young generation on its release. It was its run in the video market that made it the huge success it became, and so much of it has become part of pop culture be it in its quotable lines and simple action.\n\nWhat made it stand out was that it clearly was the antithesis of all other martial arts movies of the time which were in a boom period on video rental, but they were all muscle bound and flying around at 100mph. The Karate Kid instead centres on peace, life philosophy, defence and self-betterment.\n\nThe crux is the central partnership between the central pair of Mr Miyagi and Daniel, which begins as teacher mentoring pupil but develops into a father &amp; surrogate son relationship.\n\nThere are so many layers to this film, and the truth is that the karate is really secondary to all. Any action is short, simple and down to earth. The real fights are for the soul, against bullies and personal defeat. For Mr Miyagi it is a reawakening for him, for Daniel it is a journey of self discovery.\n\nThe greatest part is the acting. You simply can't take away from either of the two leads, the chemistry between them is just perfect. Pat Morita plays Mr Miyagi almost effortlessly but perfectly as the mentor to a young insecure Daniel, which becomes a father and surrogate son relationship. If anything the relationship helps bring Mr Miyagi out of his shell. For example, we see inside the soul of Mr Miyagi, and some of his inner torment (i.e. loss of wife &amp; child), and Daniel becomes closer to him for it.\n\nMr Miyagi is the mentor &amp; father all men wish they had.

A life impacting movie","reviewBody":"Is there anything more that can be truly said of this inspiring movie? Possibly it is the most unlikely hit movie that has generated a strong faithful following.\n\nI rewatched it after 30 years on the back of falling for the Cobra Kai series, and loved it every bit as much as when I first saw it. I'm much older but find so many new things to relate to and remind myself of in life.\n\nThe premise of the film is simple, but it is almost impossible to explain the impact this movie had on a certain young generation on its release. It was its run in the video market that made it the huge success it became, and so much of it has become part of pop culture be it in its quotable lines and simple action.\n\nWhat made it stand out was that it clearly was the antithesis of all other martial arts movies of the time which were in a boom period on video rental, but they were all muscle bound and flying around at 100mph. The Karate Kid instead centres on peace, life philosophy, defence and self-betterment.\n\nThe crux is the central partnership between the central pair of Mr Miyagi and Daniel, which begins as teacher mentoring pupil but develops into a father &amp; surrogate son relationship.\n\nThere are so many layers to this film, and the truth is that the karate is really secondary to all. Any action is short, simple and down to earth. The real fights are for the soul, against bullies and personal defeat. For Mr Miyagi it is a reawakening for him, for Daniel it is a journey of self discovery.\n\nThe greatest part is the acting. You simply can't take away from either of the two leads, the chemistry between them is just perfect. Pat Morita plays Mr Miyagi almost effortlessly but perfectly as the mentor to a young insecure Daniel, which becomes a father and surrogate son relationship. If anything the relationship helps bring Mr Miyagi out of his shell. For example, we see inside the soul of Mr Miyagi, and some of his inner torment (i.e. loss of wife &amp; child), and Daniel becomes closer to him for it.\n\nMr Miyagi is the mentor &amp; father all men wish they had. He practices &amp; teaches peace &amp; self-respect with humour &amp; dignity. Something we can all learn from. His dry wit and personal reserve are humbling to see. Winning the tournament against the bullies is secondary, but the personal development is what comes first.\n\nThe Oscar nomination for Pat Morita for the role was deserved, and unfortunate not to win it, but his role has left a lasting legacy and is in the hearts of so many.

Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.\n\nI give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure, there were some things I liked about it.

Well, maybe not that close since an "X-Men" movie requires the viewer to try to follow the lives of at least a dozen different characters. But I think it was a mistake for the makers to have Spidey contend with three different villains in one film. Unlike the two superior predecessors, it felt like they were trying to cram three movies into one with "Spider-Man 3".\n\nI was most disappointed with the use, or misuse, of the Harry Osborne/Green Goblin character. We know that Harry must become the Green Goblin if he is going to have the ability to take on his super hero nemesis Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The makers of "Spider-Man 3" waste no time in picking up where "Spider-Man 2" left off. Not only does the movie not allow the viewer to observe Harry's transformation into the Green Goblin, but Harry doesn't even dress appropriately for his role. He wears a black uniform and never becomes the public menace his father did. I was looking forward to the Daily Bugle covers about the return of the menace of the Green Goblin. Instead Harry's campaign of revenge against Peter is quickly side tracked by a bout with amnesia after suffering a blow to the head in a fall during his first fight with Peter. After all, the film needs to introduce two more villains, Sandman and Venom, before it ends.\n\nWhereas, in the first two films the viewer really gets to know the Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius characters, in "Spider-Man 3" the length of time devoted to the villains amounts to a movie short. Along the way Peter Parker must also contend with his dark side and his troubles in his relationship with his love Mary Jane Watson. Meanwhile, the landlord's daughter, Ursula, is back to amuse viewers once again with her adolescent crush on Pete. Add to all this the time needed to develop the Sandman and Venom villains, plus Gwen Stacy, and I was left wondering exactly what the movie is about.\n\n"Spider-Man 3" is big budget extravaganza that is out of focus in the areas of character and plot development. While it has its laugh inducing comic moments and the best special effects sequences money can buy, it has little else to offer. While I really wanted to see the first two movies again, because I enjoyed the transformation of the main characters into super heroes and villains, it feels like the only reason to see "Spider-Man 3" is to check out the special effects again. If there are more Spider-Man films made, and there is no reason to believe there won't be given the money involved in releasing another film, then I would hope that the makers would simplify the story once again and do what made the first two films so enjoyable to watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":509776,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well, maybe not that close since an "X-Men" movie requires the viewer to try to follow the lives of at least a dozen different characters. But I think it was a mistake for the makers to have Spidey contend with three different villains in one film. Unlike the two superior predecessors, it felt like they were trying to cram three movies into one with "Spider-Man 3".\n\nI was most disappointed with the use, or misuse, of the Harry Osborne/Green Goblin character. We know that Harry must become the Green Goblin if he is going to have the ability to take on his super hero nemesis Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The makers of "Spider-Man 3" waste no time in picking up where "Spider-Man 2" left off. Not only does the movie not allow the viewer to observe Harry's transformation into the Green Goblin, but Harry doesn't even dress appropriately for his role. He wears a black uniform and never becomes the public menace his father did. I was looking forward to the Daily Bugle covers about the return of the menace of the Green Goblin. Instead Harry's campaign of revenge against Peter is quickly side tracked by a bout with amnesia after suffering a blow to the head in a fall during his first fight with Peter. After all, the film needs to introduce two more villains, Sandman and Venom, before it ends.\n\nWhereas, in the first two films the viewer really gets to know the Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius characters, in "Spider-Man 3" the length of time devoted to the villains amounts to a movie short. Along the way Peter Parker must also contend with his dark side and his troubles in his relationship with his love Mary Jane Watson. Meanwhile, the landlord's daughter, Ursula, is back to amuse viewers once again with her adolescent crush on Pete. Add to all this the time needed to develop the Sandman and Venom villains, plus Gwen Stacy, and I was left wondering exactly what the movie is about.\n\n"Spider-Man 3" is big budget extravaganza that is out of focus in the areas of character and plot development. While it has its laugh inducing comic moments and the best special effects sequences money can buy, it has little else to offer. While I really wanted to see the first two movies again, because I enjoyed the transformation of the main characters into super heroes and villains, it feels like the only reason to see "Spider-Man 3" is to check out the special effects again. If there are more Spider-Man films made, and there is no reason to believe there won't be given the money involved in releasing another film, then I would hope that the makers would simplify the story once again and do what made the first two films so enjoyable to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":509776,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Terry Gilliam-directed fantasy has incredible production values, cinematography and scoring (not to mention two appealing lead performances by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), yet it takes a good hour to get this picture off the ground. The narrative is heavy-going and, while not a hodgepodge, the film could certainly use a bit more heart and soul rather than CGI effects. Gilliam's handling takes on a more robust, old-fashioned flavor in the second hour, and the movie improves tremendously as a result. The witch's palace (set atop a skyscraper tree) is dazzling, and the initial entrance into her raven-laden lair is deliciously giddy. Jonathan Pryce is well-cast as an evil general who attempts to torch the two men in an impressive forest fire, however the charm of the piece (and the glue holding the adventure together) lies with Damon and Ledger, and they are by turns wily, funny, strapping, childish, and heroic. **1/2 from ****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":117271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a good buddy-cop narrative between the two and they work really well together.\n\nI don't want to gush too much more over this movie, just go see it.

Terry Gilliam-directed fantasy has incredible production values, cinematography and scoring (not to mention two appealing lead performances by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), yet it takes a good hour to get this picture off the ground. The narrative is heavy-going and, while not a hodgepodge, the film could certainly use a bit more heart and soul rather than CGI effects. Gilliam's handling takes on a more robust, old-fashioned flavor in the second hour, and the movie improves tremendously as a result. The witch's palace (set atop a skyscraper tree) is dazzling, and the initial entrance into her raven-laden lair is deliciously giddy. Jonathan Pryce is well-cast as an evil general who attempts to torch the two men in an impressive forest fire, however the charm of the piece (and the glue holding the adventure together) lies with Damon and Ledger, and they are by turns wily, funny, strapping, childish, and heroic. **1/2 from ****","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":117271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One of the few things the movie managed to deliver were some dynamic battle sequences; but PG- 13 made them look fake. In the age of 300 and Spartacus TV show, this is not something you want to waste your time on.\n\nUnless you wish to add to a surprising $8 mln box office success after its first weekend, which will probably make this movie more profitable than most other current releases.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52985,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Former elite cop, former small time MMA fighter, on the run from the Russian mob who lost a bunch of money for betting against him in a match and killed his wife in revenge. The will to protect this little girl gives him a new will to live, a drive to go on. And so they run away; away from the Triads, the mob and the corrupt NYPD, trying to figure out why everyone wants either those numbers or her death.\n\nIt's a bit of Mercury Puzzle and 16 Blocks. And despite my usual fears, the story did not turn cheesy due to the kid. But the girl didn't turn into an unrealistic bad ass as well. Also they did not develop a forced deep relationship between Luke and Mei, which would be unrealistic, considering that the story doesn't go that long. The film is featuring fast paced action, wrapped into a decent (though not great) story and is supported by good acting. Well, at least good acting from the leading characters, but the supporting ones weren't that bad as well, so you don't have to suffer from it. So overall, a quite enjoyable movie, which I would recommend to fans of story driven action movies and especially to all Statham fans.\n\nJust for fun, let's check the Statham clichés. Shirtless? Yep, first time you see him in the movie. Car-chase? Of course. And when Mei was a bit concerned about his driving style, I was just waiting for a comeback from him that was like "Don't worry kid, I've been doing this for several movies now."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105359,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's much to recommend about it as this season's British indie movie with something different going for it. It's something about its character and the circumstances of what happens to her that's fascinating: sixteen year old Jenny (Carey Mulligan), a smart girl with a love for Parisian culture and music and movies, is pressured to get into Oxford, not even so much for the English degree to teach English (or Latin as case might be) but for the status. Enter in David (Sarsgard), an older man who rides up to Jenny one rainy day and offers her a ride home. From then on its a romantic affair between the two, where he whisks her to wonderful jazz clubs and auctions, and even, eventually, to Paris. A twist happens late in the film that turns all of this upside down, but I dare not reveal it here.\n\nWhat makes it interesting is not so much the teen girl with adult male aspect (on that side of the coin it's like a British version of Manhattan only told from the girl's point of view and a less conflicted man in the situation), but how the relationship is perceived by her parents and peers and teachers. This isn't some illicit affair to be kept under wraps, but something that (refreshingly for a movie at least) is out in the open, and with that comes the awkward stares and upturned eyebrows, and as well the charm that David exudes on Jenny's parents. It's as much a film about romance as it is about class, about how Jenny fits in or could fit in to a society in Britain in 1961, and how David fits in and how her parents see her fitting in (or, for that matter, how David fits others in as a property re-seller to the black community). And of course the aspect of Oxford vs. getting married, the only options for Jenny at a crucial point.\n\nAnd now for the rest of the good and... well, not so much bad but just underwhelming. The good is this newcomer Carey Mulligan. One can't wait but to see her in other films; she's a natural at playing a great range of emotions required for this complex character, a girl who thinks and acts and talks like a woman but yet still sort of a girl at the same time (see Jenny's trip to Paris for that). Supporting players like Molina and Williams are also very good, giving their scenes the proper 'umph' needed and gravitas in some key scenes. Sarsgaard fares a little less well with a good performance but less than convincing accent. The screenplay by Nick Nornby (for once he's adapting a book!) and it's written with a natural ear for the way characters at that time might speak. The direction is clear and concise and just handsome enough to be competent. The last ten minutes, however, seem rushed on all of the ends of the storytelling, after such a good momentum has been building on the crest of Jenny's future.\n\nIt's a very good movie where we care about the characters and see some life lessons learned with (usually) unsentimental results. It's a tragic-comic crumpet of a movie, dear and serious, amusing but very telling about human nature. 7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And so what if the music was not "authentic Nigerian music"? I don't remember a title card at the beginning of the movies saying it's a National Geographic documentary.\n\nThis is a good movie.  Less action than many war movies and less thought than some political dramas.  There are good and bad people of all races. There's tension and there are explosions and gunfire.  There is ample opportunity to reflect on what mankind is capable of doing to each other for political reasons.\n\nGive it a chance and I think you'll enjoy it.

Should I point out to a recent reviewer, who sarcastically pointed out that Nigeria has an air force and could have bombed the group fleeing through the jungle, that the "bad guys" are rebels, not government forces?  Since the rebels just killed everyone in the President's family, they probably scared off the government pilots, too. (Sorry...couldn't resist.)\n\nAnd since when was a movie so horribly, horribly bad because it couldn't be filmed in the actual location?  So what if this was filmed somewhere other than Nigeria?  And so what if the music was not "authentic Nigerian music"? I don't remember a title card at the beginning of the movies saying it's a National Geographic documentary.\n\nThis is a good movie.  Less action than many war movies and less thought than some political dramas.  There are good and bad people of all races. There's tension and there are explosions and gunfire.  There is ample opportunity to reflect on what mankind is capable of doing to each other for political reasons.\n\nGive it a chance and I think you'll enjoy it.  Better yet, I think you'll be sombered by it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114155,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One part of me thought the movie was going to be just another piece of teen garbage and the other half actually had hope for the film. I am very happy to say that the film was actually very good. This movie is not your average teen movie of coarse it does have a few sexual references but it doesn't go overboard with the sex jokes. The most important element of the film was its meaning which is believe in yourself and don't let the people around you control you. The plot wasn't too original but I enjoyed the film very much.\n\nThe film stars DJ Qualls as Dizzy Harrison, and his three friends Nora (Zooey Deschannel), Glen (Parry Shen), and Kirk (Jerod Mixon) who are just entering their senior year of high school. Dizzy and his friends have always been the geeks of the school and been the target of humiliation. So one day Dizzy gathers up enough courage to talk to one of the cheerleaders at the school. He actually succeeds in this goal but the cheerleader caused him to become aroused which in itself isn't too good. The next problem occurs when the cheerleader's boyfriend comes over and asks him what he is doing talking to his girlfriend. Dizzy is then humiliated in front of the entire school by the boyfriend punching him and then a hall monitor grabbing Dizzy's private area and pulling him into the principle's office. He is now so embarrassed and doesn't want to ever go back to school. So Dizzy freaks out in a fit of rage and goes to the mall and takes the microphone from the church quire and starts talking about how bad his life has been. \n\nThis then gets him thrown into prison where he meets Luther (Eddie Griffen), who was also the loser kid in high school. Luther then explains to Dizzy how to get expelled from the school so he can go into another High school and start over with a new image. So he gets out of prison and goes back to school and tries to get himself expelled by pulling many wild stunts. He then goes back to prison where he learns the ropes of how to succeed in high school as the `cool guy'.  He changes his name to Gil, which is his middle name and starts fresh at the new high school. He embarrasses the most popular guy the first day and everyone falls in love with the New Guy! Gil gains respect from the main cheerleader at this new high school (Eliza Dushku) and starts a relationship with her. Gil feels great at first until he gets so popular and forgets about his 3 buddies who he has known since he was little. Gil finds a way to encourage the new school that his friends are just as cool as him. Gil then helps raise the school spirit by encouraging the football team to win games. Everything is going well for Gil until the football game between his new school and his old school occurs. This then causes a huge problem. The bully from the first school and the bully from the new school get together and find a way to destroy Gil's reputation.\n\nThe film gives off a very good soundtrack with a mixture of many different types of music. I especially liked Dizzy's &amp; his three friends' band who sounded awesome in my opinion. I think they should really go out and get a record deal because their music rocked. So as you can tell from the brief description of the movie, it does try to have its sexual jokes but aren't very offensive or sick like other teen movies. But most importantly to me is the end the film, which made a very good point. The movie was a very fun ride for me and I seen it many times already and enjoyed it after ever viewing.

I don't know Dane Cook's stand-up and hated him in the overrated Dan In Real Life. But, we figured we could pass time for two hours so we went in.\n\nIt started routinely enough. Okay, the guy gets paid to be the date from heck so the girls goes crying back into her guy's arms. Okay concept, if executed well. Then we get Jason Biggs trying to clean up his act to impress Kate Hudson who likes him but is not wowed by him. Since Jason is Dane's roommate, he hires Dane to do his specialty. By this point, we're 20+ minutes into the movie and it made me laugh twice and is otherwise pretty lame. I looked at my watch. Then, Kate's roommate preps her for the date to sow some wild oats and the real fun begins.\n\nThe humor in My Best Friend's Girl is rude, crude, inappropriate, socially irredeemable -- and made me laugh out loud - a lot! Cook's chemistry with Hudson was electric. The twist is she can give as good as she gets and vice versa. She gets under his skin, but he stays in denial, leading to his next assignment which to me was the high point of the movie. The girl is religious and he takes her to a restaurant in an old church called Jesus Crust - where pizza is a religious experience. i don't want to spoil the inspired gags in this sequence, but I was nearly rolling in the aisles. This victim actually winds up setting the stage for a few plot twists I didn't expect. The movie is raucous fun from then on until the end.\n\nI thought Alec Baldwin was absurdly funny as the Women's Studies professor who is Cook's father. His chemistry with Cook is also terrific. Cook's former client who is about to marry Kate's sister is also hilarious as is she and the woman playing Kate's mother. Then, the movie goes a bit soft,conventional, and derivative -- but is still witty at the end, and the last two scenes play out nicely.\n\nThis is not a piece of art, but if you ever went to frat parties and can remember having fun at them and want to spend some time laughing out loud, give My Best Friend's Girl a look. I work in Manhattan so I have to be careful to whom I say I liked this movie -- that's why I call it a guilty pleasure!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As Fear the Walking Dead returns for season three, our families will be brought together in the vibrant and violent ecotone of the U.S.-Mexico border. International lines done away with following the world's end, our characters must attempt to rebuild not only society, but family as well. Madison (Kim Dickens) has reconnected with Travis (Cliff Curtis), her apocalyptic partner, but Alicia (Alycia Debnam-Carey) has been fractured by her murder of Andres. Madison's son mere miles from his mother, Nick's (Frank Dillane) first action as a leader saw Luciana (Danay Garcia) ambushed by an American militia group — the couple escaped death, but Nick no longer feels immortal. Recovering both emotionally and physically, Strand (Colman Domingo) has his sights set on harnessing the new world's curren.</desc>

As Fear the Walking Dead returns for season three, our families will be brought together in the vibrant and violent ecotone of the U.S.-Mexico border. International lines done away with following the world's end, our characters must attempt to rebuild not only society, but family as well. Madison (Kim Dickens) has reconnected with Travis (Cliff Curtis), her apocalyptic partner, but Alicia (Alycia Debnam-Carey) has been fractured by her murder of Andres. Madison's son mere miles from his mother, Nick's (Frank Dillane) first action as a leader saw Luciana (Danay Garcia) ambushed by an American militia group — the couple escaped death, but Nick no longer feels immortal. Recovering both emotionally and physically, Strand (Colman Domingo) has his sights set on harnessing the new world's curren.</desc>

The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted.

The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance).

Clive Barkers imagery of hell is profane, violent, and an oddly erotic movie from the off. The sequel continues the fantastic story, and builds on the characters we saw, whilst adding some new ones to the mix. As well as re-introducing the dead ones! As foul and degrading as newer gore porn flicks are today, Hellbound walks all over them with style and substance which has been unmatched ever since. For 1988, Hellraiser 2 is nothing short of breathtaking, and has not dated one bit. The storyline is intelligent and despite the incredible sights of hell and its inhabitants, Hellbound justifies the fantasy with thoughtful dialogue and logic and a powerful story. It also benefits that the cast in this film are mostly great actors who do a great job of suspending the viewers disbelief.\n\nBarker gives credibility to the monster in the movie. Every beast in this film has a human side and you may even feel warmed to them when they are faced with dilemmas and dramas which question even their beliefs. There is a powerful scene in which Pinhead and his minions learn of their own past from Kirsty, the heroin of the story who is pursued by the cenobites for opening the puzzle box. Pinhead even begins to look human at this point showing the "bad guys" in a different light. Before long the demons actually become the "good guys", and temporarily co-exist with Kirsty to counter the evil Doctor's hand over hell.\n\nThe violence and gore offered by Hellbound is excessive and delivered to the viewer in such horrific, profane ways it has definitely had an impact on its viewing demographic. Barker made a great job of communicating to the director his view of the film from a novel and it's a gruesome one. So gruesome it will immediately turn away many within the opening minutes.\n\nI recommend this movie for anyone who's into horror or those who think the genre is just Hostel and Saw. Hellbound, as indeed the original, breathes new life into the horror movie and for every pint of spilled blood, brings intelligence and style in buckets.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Clive Barkers imagery of hell is profane, violent, and an oddly erotic movie from the off. The sequel continues the fantastic story, and builds on the characters we saw, whilst adding some new ones to the mix. As well as re-introducing the dead ones! As foul and degrading as newer gore porn flicks are today, Hellbound walks all over them with style and substance which has been unmatched ever since. For 1988, Hellraiser 2 is nothing short of breathtaking, and has not dated one bit. The storyline is intelligent and despite the incredible sights of hell and its inhabitants, Hellbound justifies the fantasy with thoughtful dialogue and logic and a powerful story. It also benefits that the cast in this film are mostly great actors who do a great job of suspending the viewers disbelief.\n\nBarker gives credibility to the monster in the movie. Every beast in this film has a human side and you may even feel warmed to them when they are faced with dilemmas and dramas which question even their beliefs. There is a powerful scene in which Pinhead and his minions learn of their own past from Kirsty, the heroin of the story who is pursued by the cenobites for opening the puzzle box. Pinhead even begins to look human at this point showing the "bad guys" in a different light. Before long the demons actually become the "good guys", and temporarily co-exist with Kirsty to counter the evil Doctor's hand over hell.\n\nThe violence and gore offered by Hellbound is excessive and delivered to the viewer in such horrific, profane ways it has definitely had an impact on its viewing demographic. Barker made a great job of communicating to the director his view of the film from a novel and it's a gruesome one. So gruesome it will immediately turn away many within the opening minutes.\n\nI recommend this movie for anyone who's into horror or those who think the genre is just Hostel and Saw. Hellbound, as indeed the original, breathes new life into the horror movie and for every pint of spilled blood, brings intelligence and style in buckets.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows. For the rest of us, BSG raised the bar so high, we almost cannot enjoy other SF shows anymore.\n\nBut then... we can always re-watch it, and hope others will learn from it, too.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155188,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows. For the rest of us, BSG raised the bar so high, we almost cannot enjoy other SF shows anymore.\n\nBut then... we can always re-watch it, and hope others will learn from it, too.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155188,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows. For the rest of us, BSG raised the bar so high, we almost cannot enjoy other SF shows anymore.\n\nBut then... we can always re-watch it, and hope others will learn from it, too.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155188,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(If I could, I'd give it an 8.5) The premise is original and macabre, without veering into creepy. Each episode tells a concise story that's embedded within a larger unfolding story - so that at the end of 40 minutes you feel closure along with a sense of anticipation. The female character may be a bit anachronistic, but she's got moxie and she adds depth and color, literally - her blues really pop! Can't wait to see how the characters develop.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona.

Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter.

What a sad/shamey day it is when a Star Trek movie presents a not so optimistic future just as dark as today's headlines. I can read/watch the news/The Matrix if I want that. IS THERE NO ESCAPE?!!! IS THERE NO HOPE?!!! \n\nObviously, Gene Roddenberry's spirit could not find a way to keep the franchise on track.

Boring.\n\nTo me the Federation meant a time in the future when Humanity had finally gotten its act together and to a certain extent had rooted out all this corruption and terrorism. Unless a Klingon or Romulan shows up, things are supposed to be refreshingly illuminating. Not something that degrades into ordinary, mainstream, average caveman fist fight showdowns. \n\nHow can we boldly go where no man has gone before in the future unless we have thrown off the shackles of the past? What a sad/shamey day it is when a Star Trek movie presents a not so optimistic future just as dark as today's headlines. I can read/watch the news/The Matrix if I want that. IS THERE NO ESCAPE?!!! IS THERE NO HOPE?!!! \n\nObviously, Gene Roddenberry's spirit could not find a way to keep the franchise on track. Will, (Vulcan fingers crossed) Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike know the difference between the wealth of deepness and the poverty of darkness?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":467248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120388,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a bit strange because of the fact that robots fight instead of humans. With that said, the robots are perfectly anthropomorphized so you feel like they are men.\n\nBut the special effects are robot fighting are only worth about a 6/10. Hugh Jackman's struggle to be a good father is actually well-acted out, both by him and the kid. The heroine role is also acted out well by a very beautiful woman.\n\nThis is not a perfect movie, but it captures many human emotions and seems to be a good movie for family-oriented people to flock around for an emotional, Rocky-like romp.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":303029,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 10080052, Title: Historia Lizy, 
 --- Description: Historia Lizy: Directed by Alexander Zhovna. With Mykola Perestiuk, Dasha Tvoronovich. The world today is an uncomfortable place, cynic surroundings. Besides two of our characters are people suffering from Down syndrome, known as sunny kids. However, is this world sunny enough for them? Therefore, they got unique opportunity to get into the world of old black and white cinema with help of unusual screen in the magic cinema theatre. Existing in the world of favorite films they are forgetting about horrible reality. In the parallel reality, characters are like in paradise: they are free, calm and happy and totally don't want to come back to reality. Unfortunately, they have to come back and to face a cruel objectivity with dozens of complicated tasks, adventures, and a terrible tragedy later.

After that, it's just a fun ride.\n\nSamara Weaving is the absolute best, she mixes fear, irony, humor and toughness like no one else. Loved her in The Babysitter and in this one.\n\nJust go for it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118606,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(plus the story takes place in 1997 anyway!!) other than that detail, viewers should have no complaints with this film. it's intense but not overbearing. easy to follow but complex. and you'll be impressed with wahlberg's character... go see for yourself!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":315784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

(plus the story takes place in 1997 anyway!!) other than that detail, viewers should have no complaints with this film. it's intense but not overbearing. easy to follow but complex. and you'll be impressed with wahlberg's character... go see for yourself!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":315784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And what better way to relieve boredom than an extramarital affair with Charlie - the philandering consular official (Liev Schrieber)? But Walter discovers the affair and decides to volunteer to a cholera stricken province and take Kitty with him. Charlie was never serious anyway so off they go into the jaws of death. In the cholera infested back of beyond Walter and Kitty discover more about each other than they did in many months of marriage. A mutual respect grows into something else but it is a cholera infested region after all. So the tale must have a tragic ending and it does. But it leaves one with a sense of relief as the camera finally moves away from the oppressive dark tones and into light.\n\nThe movie has beautiful performances by Ed Norton and Ms. Watts. His serious, then almost sinister, then enlighetened Walter is the perfect foil to her luminous, wicked and then vulnerable Kitty. Liev Schrieber is good in the brief role as Charlie and all the supporting cast is very good indeed. The locale is stunning and the mood is brilliantly captured in the dark, the shadows and moments of light.\n\nAre there Hollywood moments? Of course there are, mostly during the growing attraction between the lead pair there are the clichéd moments of "intoxication", his looking suddenly more attractive and youthful, her moments with the orphanage kids. But none of it is over the top. The movie is full of mood, sensuous beauty and emotion.

Loosely following the story Hansel and Gretel. The soundtrack certainly adds to the film. It's not an ott typical USA film. Using the fantastic scenery of Ireland, that can be made to be very haunting. My only criticism is sometimes the sound of dialogue is not clear enough and difficult to understand a few mumbled lines.

I dig her show. But it turns out creating sustained, feature-length comedy is a different bag altogether. \n\nI appreciate Schumer/Apatow's attempts at grounded, human comedy. This doesn't have to be as broad as say, "Spy", which was way more funny and, I think, thematically much smarter. But if you're going for grounded comedy then the characters have to be... well, interesting. And every single character in this is a one-dimensional shell. Each one has their role to play in the script and are nothing beyond that. The performances are strong, and the actors work hard to humanize their characters, but no person in this film is expansive or complex or terribly engaging or remotely unpredictable in any way. In fact, absolutely nothing is unpredictable in this film. So, for me, it comes off as not broad enough to be funny, and not genuine enough to be grounded. \n\nCombine this overwhelming predictability, flat characterization and the sports-stunt casting with Apatow's habit for long running times, and an uninspired, robot-written third act, and you get a film that's more tedious than fun. \n\nBut Schumer herself is funny. And more than that, she's important. She's at her best when she's exploding the precious notion of female body imagery in joke after joke about bloody tampons and promiscuity. But the film lacks the courage of its star, which is a complicated criticism, since she actually wrote it. \n\nThere was the potential to make something outrageous and beautiful here. That potential was pretty much blown.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131748,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Jaje</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Yumurta: Directed by Semih Kaplanoglu. With Nejat Isler, Saadet Aksoy, Ufuk Bayraktar, Kaan Karabacak. Poet Yusuf (35-38) returns to his childhood hometown, which he hadn't visited for years, upon his mother's death. He is faced with a neglected, crumbling house. Ayla, a young girl (17-19) awaits him there. Yusuf has been unaware of the existence of this distant relation who had been living with his mother for five years; He stays by his dead mother's bedside for a while on the morning of his return. Ayla's presence alleviates the emotions evoked by death to an extent. But how will Yusuf cope with the guilt that embraces him after the funeral? Will he manage to overcome it? The maternal household's chattels, and everyday habits, the staid rhythm of the provinces and the spaces filled with ghosts&amp;; The town he once had left to escape all this, re-enchants Yusuf. Yusuf finds out on the day he's due to return to Istanbul that he is obliged to perform the sacrifice his mother had been prevented by death from fulfilling. Ayla pressures him. Yusuf and Ayla set off for the saint's tomb, some three or four hours away, for the traditional sacrifice ceremony that his mother Zehra had pledged. Ayla is very excited about this, her first trip out of the small town. An accident is to force Yusuf to confront all that he had been trying to evade. Unable to locate the herd amongst which the sacrificial animal was to be selected, they have to spend the night in a hotel by the crater lake.

 --- Description: Yumurta: Directed by Semih Kaplanoglu. With Nejat Isler, Saadet Aksoy, Ufuk Bayraktar, Kaan Karabacak. Poet Yusuf (35-38) returns to his childhood hometown, which he hadn't visited for years, upon his mother's death. He is faced with a neglected, crumbling house. Ayla, a young girl (17-19) awaits him there. Yusuf has been unaware of the existence of this distant relation who had been living with his mother for five years; He stays by his dead mother's bedside for a while on the morning of his return. Ayla's presence alleviates the emotions evoked by death to an extent. But how will Yusuf cope with the guilt that embraces him after the funeral? Will he manage to overcome it? The maternal household's chattels, and everyday habits, the staid rhythm of the provinces and the spaces filled with ghosts&amp;; The town he once had left to escape all this, re-enchants Yusuf. Yusuf finds out on the day he's due to return to Istanbul that he is obliged to perform the sacrifice his mother had been prevented by death from fulfilling. Ayla pressures him. Yusuf and Ayla set off for the saint's tomb, some three or four hours away, for the traditional sacrifice ceremony that his mother Zehra had pledged. Ayla is very excited about this, her first trip out of the small town. An accident is to force Yusuf to confront all that he had been trying to evade. Unable to locate the herd amongst which the sacrificial animal was to be selected, they have to spend the night in a hotel by the crater lake. While the falling snow blankets guilt, they are no longer heading back to that old town." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1021004/","name":"Yumurta","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzEwM2UxOWYtN2ZhNS00ZGU1LWFiN2YtNDQ5ZGU2MWZmZGJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5OTk2OA@@._V1_.jpg","genre":["Drama"],"actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1625479/","name":"Nejat Isler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2278522/","name":"Saadet Aksoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1832249/","name":"Ufuk Bayraktar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0969427/","name":"Semih Kaplanoglu"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208075/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063873/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056024/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10236639/","name":"Erdogan Alkan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6588007/","name":"Leyla Ipekci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0969427/","name":"Semih Kaplanoglu"],"datePublished":"2007-11-09","description":"Poet Yusuf (35-38) returns to his childhood hometown, which he hadn't visited for years, upon his mother's death.

The action is not as frequent as it seems spaced out, with more comical elements finding its way in where Chan toys around. Even the script shines the spotlight on some political issues involving communist's rebels vs. mainland Chinese imperials, which can make things a little talky and some sub-plots feel aimless. It starts off rather sharp, but never recaptures that spirit it began with.

Ed Stagg. He learns that his son-in-law (Frank Converse) has been having an affair so he goes to the woman to make her put an end to the affair. Stagg accidentally kills her so he must protect himself but also try to keep the police from finding out who her boyfriend was. I've come to expect a certain amount of silliness when it comes to these made-for-TV flicks from the 70s. It really doesn't matter what they're about but the majority of them are entertaining but also very campy. That's pretty much the case here as we get a pretty good story but it's mixed in with some very dumb moments. One of the biggest killers of this type of film are how over dramatic they can be and this here usually happens right before we go to commercial as the music blares and we get a silly zoom shot towards the guilty person. We get quite a bit of that here but we also get some very silly moments including the scenes at the start when Bridges busts into the woman's house and just keeps insulting her and calling her a tramp. I couldn't help but laugh at this as well as some of the more sillier moments including a priceless sequence where Bridges is trying to protect his daughter yet he never realizes that he's just putting a burden on her. The entire "protecting the daughter" is driven into the ground here as we get countless dialogue scenes with Bridges expressing his love for his daughter, which is fine but at times they are way too cute and over the top. With that said, the story itself is a pretty interesting one and I thought it was also rather clever as we had Bridges trying to do two things at once. I think it goes against his character that he'd do so many wrong things to try and clear everything up. As for the actor, he's great fun to watch here as he really gives it his all and keeps the film moving from start to finish. We also get a great supporting cast that includes Murray Hamilton, Broderick Crawford, Val Avery, Whit Bissell, John Fielder and Anne Helm as the other woman. The daughter in the film has to be one of the dumbest characters in the history of film as you'd think you were watching a 2-year-old. She can never figure things out and is constantly coming off either stupid or just downright ignorant and one can't help but grow frustrated with her.

Ed Stagg. He learns that his son-in-law (Frank Converse) has been having an affair so he goes to the woman to make her put an end to the affair. Stagg accidentally kills her so he must protect himself but also try to keep the police from finding out who her boyfriend was. I've come to expect a certain amount of silliness when it comes to these made-for-TV flicks from the 70s. It really doesn't matter what they're about but the majority of them are entertaining but also very campy. That's pretty much the case here as we get a pretty good story but it's mixed in with some very dumb moments. One of the biggest killers of this type of film are how over dramatic they can be and this here usually happens right before we go to commercial as the music blares and we get a silly zoom shot towards the guilty person. We get quite a bit of that here but we also get some very silly moments including the scenes at the start when Bridges busts into the woman's house and just keeps insulting her and calling her a tramp. I couldn't help but laugh at this as well as some of the more sillier moments including a priceless sequence where Bridges is trying to protect his daughter yet he never realizes that he's just putting a burden on her. The entire "protecting the daughter" is driven into the ground here as we get countless dialogue scenes with Bridges expressing his love for his daughter, which is fine but at times they are way too cute and over the top. With that said, the story itself is a pretty interesting one and I thought it was also rather clever as we had Bridges trying to do two things at once. I think it goes against his character that he'd do so many wrong things to try and clear everything up. As for the actor, he's great fun to watch here as he really gives it his all and keeps the film moving from start to finish. We also get a great supporting cast that includes Murray Hamilton, Broderick Crawford, Val Avery, Whit Bissell, John Fielder and Anne Helm as the other woman. The daughter in the film has to be one of the dumbest characters in the history of film as you'd think you were watching a 2-year-old. She can never figure things out and is constantly coming off either stupid or just downright ignorant and one can't help but grow frustrated with her. If you're a fan of the genre then this here is pretty much a must-see."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"duration":"PT1H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze.

Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju.

Već znamo da je "Agencija za sve i svašta" vlasotinačko preduzeće koje rešava sve probleme svojih klijenata. Osnivač i vlasnik firme je Spiridon Don Karamarković, nekadašnji pripadnik Legije stranaca, ekspert za sva pitanja i najškrtiji gazda na svetu. Deda mu je rekao da svaki uspešan Srbin mora da ima kafanu i on je ove godine osnovao svoju. Poslove oko kafane poverio je misterioznoj Madam Žaklini koja je naše gore list, ali je ugostiteljsko znanje sticala u Parizu.</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju.

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

Prije političkog angažiranja, malo je bio poznat u narodu, bavio se književnošću i narodnim umotvorinama. Čak ni televizija koja 2015. godine objavljuje rezultate izbora nije imala njegovu sliku. Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu. Umjesto napisanih političkih govora, on je govorio prosto, služeći se izrekama i tako postao vrlo popularan lik, omiljen u narodu. PREMIJER je sitkom serija na temu lica i naličja politike i političara. Junaci PREMIJERA iza viskokih državnih funkcija kriju ljudske mane i vrline, i mi pokušavamo, u neskrivenom nušićevskom maniru, da iznesemo pred gledatelji smiješnu a ponekad i gorku stranu osobnosti onih koji odlučuju o sudbini naroda i zemlje.</desc>

Prije političkog angažiranja, malo je bio poznat u narodu, bavio se književnošću i narodnim umotvorinama. Čak ni televizija koja 2015. godine objavljuje rezultate izbora nije imala njegovu sliku. Međutim, kada je postao premijer, malo-pomalo, bivao je simpatičan običnom narodu. Umjesto napisanih političkih govora, on je govorio prosto, služeći se izrekama i tako postao vrlo popularan lik, omiljen u narodu. PREMIJER je sitkom serija na temu lica i naličja politike i političara. Junaci PREMIJERA iza viskokih državnih funkcija kriju ljudske mane i vrline, i mi pokušavamo, u neskrivenom nušićevskom maniru, da iznesemo pred gledatelji smiješnu a ponekad i gorku stranu osobnosti onih koji odlučuju o sudbini naroda i zemlje.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

Sve ovo je ipak protkano životom i nenametljivim humorom uz blagu ironiju. Serija "Ljubav i mržnja" zamišljena je u najboljem maniru američke obiteljske serije, sa naizgled definiranim ali zamršenim i nedpredvidivim odnosima između njenih aktera. Tako se ova serija sa svim svojim zavrzlamama kako novac nije garancija za zdravlje i sreću, ali da ga je vrlo lijepo imati i prije svega prikazivati. Cilj serije je da zabavi da gledatelje veže za svoj sadržaj i da prije svega traje.</desc>

One of the coolest stoner comedy with a - as always - fantastic Ron Perlman and a Rupert Grint who obviously wanted to exit from the Harry Potter era. Regardless of the subject, this movie was for me an enormous laugh from the opening credits to the very end. It was even better because I didn't know anything about it, in particular that it was a comedy. Ron Perlman is sent by the CIA to England to shoot a fake movie of the moon landing directed by Stanley Kubrick in case of failure of the Apollo 11 mission. Of course, nothing happens as expected. Don't expect Citizen Kane, but I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8765,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I loved it!","reviewBody":"It must be awesome being Michael Bay. I mean, can you imagine any other director who is given mega-budgets every few weeks and told to blow up more than he did in his previous movies? In the first Bad Boys film an air-plane hanger was blown to bits and was swiftly followed by an asteroid being nuked in Armageddon and the destruction of Pearl Harbour in...uh, Pearl Harbour. Not to be undone, Bad Boys 2 has him indulging in not one, but two chaotic car chases where muscle cars which most of us would spend our lives saving up for are torn to pieces like yesterday's newspapers and rounding everything up by detonating a sizable part of Cuba. If this trend continues, there won't be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut.\n\nIf you've seen the first Bad Boys film, you'll know what to expect. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, a pair of loose cannon cops whose only similarities are their penchants for arguing and getting into gun fights. Lowrey (Smith) is all laid back cool, stylin' and profilin' his way through the Miami underworld while charming the pants off every woman that crosses his path. Burnett on the other hand is an insecure, neurotic and over protective family man. Not only that, but he has a bit of an anger management problem as well and has been half a step away from a severe nervous breakdown for the majority of his adult life. So far, so very similar to any cop orientated buddy movie you've ever seen, but Bad Boys 2 overcomes the total lack of originality thanks to the natural charisma of the stars and the sheer spectacle of its action sequences.\n\nThe plot of course is throw away guff designed to hurtle Smith and Lawrence into the thick of as many explosions as possible, but when they bounce off each other this well it's difficult to care. Martin Lawrence has never been a great leading man but somehow, when partnered with Will Smith his career makes perfect sense, his manic edginess being the perfect foil to Smith's effortless charm. You could argue that being on screen with the World's Most Charismatic Man would make anyone look good, but then you'd clearly not have seen the terrible I, Robot, where nobody looked good. Not even the robot.\n\nAnd then you have the aforementioned action sequences. Yes, we all know they're going to be over the top, but lord almighty, it's still an adrenaline pumping thrill to see them happen. The opening John Woo impression with the Ku Klux Klan is just the starter to a main course that consists of a destruction derby car chase, a close quarters battle with some Rastafarian gang members, a fist fight on a train carriage, ANOTHER insane car chase and a dessert set in Cuba, where a mansion gets destroyed. Throughout, bodies fly off overpasses to go crashing into glass phone boxes, men are riddled with machine gun fire and the balls of fire get bigger and more firey the later they appear. Bad Boys 2 might not be subtle, but it sure as hell is fun.\n\nHowever, there is a drawback: the running time. It might be an energetic exercise in flashy excess, but did it really need to be two and a half hours long? Entertaining though it is, there comes a point when you've seen enough faceless henchmen getting holes drilled in them and just want to see the villain being brought down.

Maybe they were worried he'd pack the movie into his bags and run off with them like he did the first time around...\n\nThose grumbles aside, there's little complaint to be made about Bad Boys 2. Sure, it's so shallow that I could just as easily have written "Will Smith and Martin Lawrence destroy stuff" and summed up the entire enterprise, but it makes for an exhilarating action movie and the natural successor to all those ones produced in the eighties when brain cells were exchanged for body counts and biceps. Try not to take it seriously and you'll have a blast.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235605,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Here's a film that doesn't try to hide its gleeful perverseness under a bushel of coy double entendres; instead the film revels in its frank and openhearted treatment of sexuality and lust.  `American Wedding' is clearly a comedy about sex and it doesn't pretend to be anything but.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad will, I suppose, depend on your own affinity and tolerance for jokes and images that routinely push the boundaries of common decency and good taste.  In fact, the film wears its tastelessness almost as a badge of honor.  And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an `American Pie' world.\n\nIn `American Wedding,' Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot.  The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter.  The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky.  Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.\n\nIndeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular `American' outing.  The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore.   This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in `American Wedding,' just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary.  Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie.  In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, `American Wedding' conveys a certain affection for its characters.  In addition to Stifler, Jason Biggs as Jim and Eugene Levy as Jim's befuddled but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent, well-meaning and likable individuals.\n\nThe film itself may be uneven, but as a character actor who makes an indelible impression on the material at hand, Scott is the genuine article. He transforms what is essentially cinematic rotgut into sweet-tasting vintage wine.  All hail the Stifman!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":197238,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an `American Pie' world.\n\nIn `American Wedding,' Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot.  The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter.  The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky.  Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.\n\nIndeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular `American' outing.  The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore.   This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in `American Wedding,' just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary.  Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie.  In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, `American Wedding' conveys a certain affection for its characters.  In addition to Stifler, Jason Biggs as Jim and Eugene Levy as Jim's befuddled but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent, well-meaning and likable individuals.\n\nThe film itself may be uneven, but as a character actor who makes an indelible impression on the material at hand, Scott is the genuine article. He transforms what is essentially cinematic rotgut into sweet-tasting vintage wine.  All hail the Stifman!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":197238,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

'Bridget Jones's Baby' looks good, being mostly attractive visually in a film that doesn't require epic sweeping cinematography or opulence while still being beautifully shot and with striking locations.\n\nAgain, like the previous two films, 'Bridget Jones's' Baby' is adeptly played. Renee Zellwegger, whose Bridget is nowhere near as much a parody or the butt of the joke like in 'Edge of Reason', overdoes it in the facial expressions (on a side note, and no shallowness intended, the Botox does not help), but really attempts and succeeds at bringing out the great qualities of her acting in the previous two films, trying to bring out the funny, adorably awkward and sympathetic sides of her character when the material allows it and her accent more than game.\n\nColin Firth is sophisticated, understated and charmingly stoic. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent seem incapable of giving bad performances, though they did deserve more to do, while Sarah Solemani brings an enjoyable amount of sauciness. The casting highlight however is Emma Thompson, who is a hoot and is a breath of fresh air with the funniest material. On that note, there are more amusing moments here than there were in 'Edge of Reason', Thompson's material mostly but also the reason for Hugh Grant's absence and Ed Sheeran. The soundtrack is more appealing this time round with better choice of songs.\n\nFor all those good things, the story is even more contrived and predictable than 'Edge of Reason', and, apart from a few good moments, too much of the writing and gags are tired, recycled and even more stale, freshness was sorely lacking here.

It had a lot going for it, and succeeded on almost every level. It didn't cover much new ground and didn't break any conventions, but it was warm, charming, hugely funny and sometimes poignant, with a great cast. 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' was however a big step down, despite being adeptly played it lost a lot of what made 'Bridget Jones's' Diary so good.\n\nHeard a lot of different opinions on 'Bridget Jones's' Baby. Some people said that it was a return to form and a huge improvement over 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'. Others said that it was worse and had no point to it. Having seen it myself, initially worried but really wanting to like it and judge it as mindless entertainment, to me it was an improvement but not by much. Not a return to form and nowhere near as good as 'Bridget Jones's Diary'. There are things that are done better here, but there are also the same mistakes and also a few different ones.\n\nIt has its good points certainly. 'Bridget Jones's Baby' looks good, being mostly attractive visually in a film that doesn't require epic sweeping cinematography or opulence while still being beautifully shot and with striking locations.\n\nAgain, like the previous two films, 'Bridget Jones's' Baby' is adeptly played. Renee Zellwegger, whose Bridget is nowhere near as much a parody or the butt of the joke like in 'Edge of Reason', overdoes it in the facial expressions (on a side note, and no shallowness intended, the Botox does not help), but really attempts and succeeds at bringing out the great qualities of her acting in the previous two films, trying to bring out the funny, adorably awkward and sympathetic sides of her character when the material allows it and her accent more than game.\n\nColin Firth is sophisticated, understated and charmingly stoic. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent seem incapable of giving bad performances, though they did deserve more to do, while Sarah Solemani brings an enjoyable amount of sauciness. The casting highlight however is Emma Thompson, who is a hoot and is a breath of fresh air with the funniest material. On that note, there are more amusing moments here than there were in 'Edge of Reason', Thompson's material mostly but also the reason for Hugh Grant's absence and Ed Sheeran. The soundtrack is more appealing this time round with better choice of songs.\n\nFor all those good things, the story is even more contrived and predictable than 'Edge of Reason', and, apart from a few good moments, too much of the writing and gags are tired, recycled and even more stale, freshness was sorely lacking here. The romantic elements are lacking in heart and warmth and, despite a subject that so many people would relate to, 'Bridget Jones's Baby' does little with the subject and offers nothing illuminating.\n\nSome of the subplots are strange and clumsily used, especially the one dealing with the punk rock, which didn't seem to fit. Patrick Dempsey is a comparatively fairly weak and mediocre at best substitute for the much missed Hugh Grant (who excelled so well at playing against type previously), having much less of his charm and charisma and instead coming off as both bland and annoying.\n\nWhile the songs themselves are good, the placement for some isn't, with some misplaced randomness going on. Sharon Maguire's direction is more competent here but is still uninspired, while there is some amateurish editing and obvious, cheap use of green screen.\n\nOverall, not awful but a disappointment and should have been so much better. Instead of laughing consistently, being touched or oohing and ahhing, found myself questioning 'Bridget Jones's Baby's' necessity and thinking "so what?". 5/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70262,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's ingenious. You can see that he's inspired by past events and that his feelings are honest. Every Serb should find something to learn out of it... I don't expect for the foreigners to find it as interesting, but Serbs should find every aspect of the script ingenious, no exceptions. There are some that claim that this movie is not based on historical facts... It isn't, it's based on a play, and play is based on epic literature. Learn to live with it. This script delivers a strong message to every Serb world wide... Directing? Sucked. Camera is bad. Budget is as low as water supply in Sudan. This movie deserves a higher budget and a better director. I respect Sotra for what he is, but he ain't a kind of director for this movie, if you know what I mean. If you're a Serb, or if you're interested in Serbian history, this movie, along with Drina March is just the one for you. Try to ignore the terrible camera work.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2413,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's ingenious. You can see that he's inspired by past events and that his feelings are honest. Every Serb should find something to learn out of it... I don't expect for the foreigners to find it as interesting, but Serbs should find every aspect of the script ingenious, no exceptions. There are some that claim that this movie is not based on historical facts... It isn't, it's based on a play, and play is based on epic literature. Learn to live with it. This script delivers a strong message to every Serb world wide... Directing? Sucked. Camera is bad. Budget is as low as water supply in Sudan. This movie deserves a higher budget and a better director. I respect Sotra for what he is, but he ain't a kind of director for this movie, if you know what I mean. If you're a Serb, or if you're interested in Serbian history, this movie, along with Drina March is just the one for you. Try to ignore the terrible camera work.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2413,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But this is the opinion of those who do not understand the culture of the Serbian nation and they judge by their own standards. Otherwise I'm from Bulgaria I find "Mi nismo andjeli 2" one of the funniest movies from eastern Europe. Also a have read the other comment about the movie, saying that dialogues and themes in them are too offending and badly executed. But that's the way Serbian people talk and it's funny and i like it a lot and when you are from different culture first try to understand and than give your opinion. I'm sorry that I do not have the time to write more about this brilliant comedy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4403,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He puts such thoughtfulness into the role, he actually improves the script without changing a word. Why is he always so great?\n\nThe main character, Vanessa Paradis, shows a raw hunger for life, revenge, and love that most of the time makes her incredibly unlikable. However, whether it's her charming beauty or the reminder that she is very young and is only despicable because that's the only way she knows how to survive, the audience can't help but hope she gets her act together. She's spent her entire life without a mother and hating an absent father, scamming and stealing with her friends, Clotilde Courau and Sekkou Sall. Her actions are truly awful, but when she finally decides to track down her dad and get some answers, the audience sees she's trying to create a better life.\n\nIf you liked Obsession, check out this film. That one was a thriller and this one is more of an indie drama, but they're similar enough that you'll probably like both.\n\nKiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Hands down to David for an impressive performance here but I felt that he was portrayed more of like of the grown up version of Daniel from karate kid and has no Ninja background within him whatsoever which for me seemed out of place\n\nApart from that, I felt that the script for film was quickly rewritten after Dudikoff's exit. Rumors had it that he and the director (and probably Steve James) had some kind of argument backstage which led to Michael's departure from the franchise. James did a decent job in trying to make the film entertaining but in the end the film failed to impress me due to the fact that the title itself didn't really connect to the film\n\nI think that if the crew took time in developing Bradley's character better (by giving him a more convincing ninja background), then it would have made the film better than what was given here","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.6},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As I had no history or prior knowledge to the events that transpired in Iran in the 1980s, the brief amount of a history lesson was just enough to maintain my interest. Throughout the film, there are times when I might have started to wander through long bouts of dialog, but witty comments by the characters kept me entertained. By the time the climax was about to hit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, biting at my fingers, awaiting their next move.\n\nWell done Ben, well done.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":582610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But from the moment the movie began up until the end, I was gripping for the characters the whole way, the way movies should be.\n\nThe opening of the movie played a huge part in setting the tone of the rest of the film. As I had no history or prior knowledge to the events that transpired in Iran in the 1980s, the brief amount of a history lesson was just enough to maintain my interest. Throughout the film, there are times when I might have started to wander through long bouts of dialog, but witty comments by the characters kept me entertained. By the time the climax was about to hit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, biting at my fingers, awaiting their next move.\n\nWell done Ben, well done.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":582610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a fairly interesting story that got a major boost from current events last September once we learned that banks actually do have shadier dealings than expected. Only the ironic part now is will people be willing or even able to pay to see this movie. My recommendation would be wait for the DVD. Director Tim Tykwer ("Run Lola Run") does a decent directing job and for a while "The International" crackles with suspense but soon the interesting idea posed by the script, by Eric Singer, just fizzles out.\n\nClive Owen plays Louis Salinger, an Interpol agent whose been trailing the business practices of one of the biggest banks in the world, the IBBC, for what seems like years. Just when he manages to find witnesses, they either end up dead or manipulated into silence. He teams up with Manhattan District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) to bring the bank to justice but she's getting added pressure to shut this whole investigation down because the two are coming up with next to no evidence. The bank's trail of money, used for everything from arms deals to murder, sends Salinger and Whitman globe-trotting from Berlin to Milan to New York to Istanbul but one dead end could shut the case down for good.\n\nI'm usually not very cognizant of camera shots so the fact that i'm saying Tykwer really makes you think about perfect camera movement and angles really says a lot for what he does here. Not only does he start the suspense up early with strong verbal encounters/hard stares between characters but the way he frames and pans along the beautiful design of places like the Guggenheim Museum and the IBBC headquarters or the ancient buildings, narrow, bustling streets, and rooftops of Instanbul is fantastic. Nearly every scene has a lively visual quality. His one mistake actually comes with the movie's one big action sequence. It's a bloody shootout inside the Guggenheim but it just seems messy and hard to make out, a Paul Greengrass imitation without the exciting energy of a "Bourne" movie.\n\nThe screenplay by Singer is more than partly to blame. His story starts out well, catching our attention with the bank's deceptive and shady practices and building up a healthy dose of paranoia as well. The problem is the screenplay then lets itself off far too easily. Instead of focusing on how the bank creates slaves-to-debt and how the whole process works, the movie just vaguely and complicatedly brushes over those issues in favor of lazy, generic plotting. Salinger and Whitman soon find that their best option is pinning a murder on IBBC, just you would think a major bank could do better than hiring such an easily track-able killer. And where the movie really goes wrong is the conclusion, which doesn't go into how the bank is actually taken down as much as it just satisfies the audience's need for bloodlust. You can tell that no one knew how to end this thing.\n\nCasting Clive Owen is a good idea. He brings a determined, serious demeanor to Salinger though with the type of roles he has played recently, you wonder why this guy turned down James Bond. He seems like a natural for it. The rest of the cast struggles with poor character development. Naomi Watts gets a role so useless that it could have easily been played by my grandma. Armin Mueller Stahl shows up as a former communist whose lost his way and now works with the bank as a consultant or something. He gets one well written scene, going man-o-e-man-o with Owen but otherwise not that many impressions are made by the cast. Unfortunately for the movie, try as Tykwer and Owen might, it also fails to make much of an impression as well.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92601,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1664390,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9.2},"duration":"PT2H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1664390,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9.2,"duration":"PT2H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Of course, it's not long before evil spirits pop up again in Manhattan and they're back doing what they do best.  What makes this one work as well as the first is the relationship between the main characters.  Bill Murray gets the great one liners again, and his scenes with Sigourney Weaver are just as goods as the first film.  Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis provide enough silly techno jargon and odd references to slime and ghosts to keep you smiling.  Still, you can't beat a 100 foot marshmallow man in Manhattan.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186380,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Heston) zapovjeda svemirskim brodom u kojem se nalazi još troje astronauta. Let traje sedamsto godina zemaljskog vremena i oni ga provode u nekoj vrsti hibernacije. Raketa se spusti na nepoznat planet gdje ih napadnu gorile koji koriste oružje i međusobno razgovaraju na engleskom... "Planet majmuna" snimljen je za približno šest milijuna dolara, a zaradio je samo u Americi 1968. trideset i dva milijuna. O popularnosti filma i njegovom svojevrsnom "kultu" svjedoči i činjenica da su od 1970. do 1973. snimljena čak četiri "nastavka", a kasnije i dvije TV serije. Godine 2001. svoju verziju romana snimio je i Tim Burton. Prvi film "Planet majmuna" snimljen je prema romanu francuskog pisca Pierrea Boullea koji se proslavio knjigom "Most na rijeci Kwai". Konačnu verziju scenarija napisao je Michael Wilson, autor scenarija i za film "Most na rijeci Kwai". Wilson je "Planetu majmuna" dodao štih političke alegorije. Redatelj Franklin J. Schaffner (1920.-1989.), kojeg pamtimo po "Pattonu", "Leptiru" i "Momcima iz Brazila", spojio je akciju i nenametljivu "filozofiju" u napet i zabavan film.</desc>

C'mon -- what would ST be without absurd premises?\n\nI love the message, too, that our maniacal quest for god is corruption -- and that when we think we're staring god in the face what we're really looking at is the worst in US.  Our gods reflect back at us our arrogance and lust for power.  Great point.  Too bad the studio felt the need to reign in Shatner's story to make it more politically correct, but the outline of his radical idea remains.\n\nThis movie gave me a new respect for a series that I had thought of previously as being merely a lot of entertaining fluff.  Thanks go to paramount for giving it the green light.  Sad to say that, only a decade later, nothing like this could make it past the Hollywood studio PC censors."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yes, the premise is absurd, but, geeze, all the ST premises are absurd.  What, you think warp drive, transporters and planets where *aliens* speak *English* are believable?  C'mon -- what would ST be without absurd premises?\n\nI love the message, too, that our maniacal quest for god is corruption -- and that when we think we're staring god in the face what we're really looking at is the worst in US.  Our gods reflect back at us our arrogance and lust for power.  Great point.  Too bad the studio felt the need to reign in Shatner's story to make it more politically correct, but the outline of his radical idea remains.\n\nThis movie gave me a new respect for a series that I had thought of previously as being merely a lot of entertaining fluff.  Thanks go to paramount for giving it the green light.  Sad to say that, only a decade later, nothing like this could make it past the Hollywood studio PC censors.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I've never seen a sequel that spoofs its predecessor harder than this one does. 10 years after the original TCM, Leatherface is back, making a stunning entrance atop a speeding pick-up truck with his legendary chainsaw held high. After dispatching two incredibly annoying, cell-phone wielding yuppies, the cannibalistic Sawyer family is after Stretch, a DJ who was on the phone with the two idiotic victims and heard everything that happened. Simultaneously using Stretch as bait and protecting her from the Sawyers is bug-eyed weirdo Dennis Hopper, playing the demented, chainsaw packing sheriff and uncle to one of the previous films unfortunate victims.\n\nThis movie is definitely played for comedy, black as it may be. It's almost a retelling of the first tale, as Stretch runs screaming through the Sawyers underground abode, only to end up bent over a washtub while Grandpa feebly whacks away at her head with a hammer. There's a great chainsaw-as-penis scene, where Leatherface suddenly discovers sex and orgasms and promptly loses interest in chainsawing Stretch to death. There's also a hideous hammer murder and a gruesome "defacing" scene, just so you don't forget that, no matter how hilarious, this movie is still about over-the-top gore, mutilations, cannibalism and fates worse than death. Just when your stomach starts lurching, along comes another sickening joke to relieve the tension.\n\nThis is a brilliantly done film, made even better by its offbeat humor and oddly likable characters. In my humble opinion, it's the perfect sequel, done the way more sequels ought to be done."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28799,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've never seen a sequel that spoofs its predecessor harder than this one does. 10 years after the original TCM, Leatherface is back, making a stunning entrance atop a speeding pick-up truck with his legendary chainsaw held high. After dispatching two incredibly annoying, cell-phone wielding yuppies, the cannibalistic Sawyer family is after Stretch, a DJ who was on the phone with the two idiotic victims and heard everything that happened. Simultaneously using Stretch as bait and protecting her from the Sawyers is bug-eyed weirdo Dennis Hopper, playing the demented, chainsaw packing sheriff and uncle to one of the previous films unfortunate victims.\n\nThis movie is definitely played for comedy, black as it may be. It's almost a retelling of the first tale, as Stretch runs screaming through the Sawyers underground abode, only to end up bent over a washtub while Grandpa feebly whacks away at her head with a hammer. There's a great chainsaw-as-penis scene, where Leatherface suddenly discovers sex and orgasms and promptly loses interest in chainsawing Stretch to death. There's also a hideous hammer murder and a gruesome "defacing" scene, just so you don't forget that, no matter how hilarious, this movie is still about over-the-top gore, mutilations, cannibalism and fates worse than death. Just when your stomach starts lurching, along comes another sickening joke to relieve the tension.\n\nThis is a brilliantly done film, made even better by its offbeat humor and oddly likable characters. In my humble opinion, it's the perfect sequel, done the way more sequels ought to be done.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28799,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Poručnika to sve podseća na dešavanja od pre 13 godina kada su slična iskustva imali njegovi nećakinja i nećak Seli i Frenklin. Lefti kreće u potragu, a prvi trag mu je radio emisija u koju su se dvojica nastradalih javili baš neposredno pre tragičnih događaja. Mlada radio voditeljka će se nakon puštanja snimka pogibije naći na udaru Lederfejsa i njegovog brata Čop Topa (rođeni brat stopera iz prvog dela serijala, koji je u vreme tih događaja bio u Vijetnamu). Mlada voditeljka nakon tog incidenta kreće za dvojicom kanibala i ubica, a za njom kreće i Lefti.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta.

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Serija "Seinfeld" opravdano se etablirala kao jedna od najuspješnijih i najpopularnijih humorističnih serija u povijesti televizije. Takozvana "serija o ničemu" uspjela je redefinirati žanr humorističnih serija gotovo preko noći. "Seinfeld" je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emmyja, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj malen u usporedbi s višemilijunskim auditorijem koji je svakog tjedna sjedao pred TV kako bi vidio što Njemu večeras smeta. Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Neurotičan lik kojeg je Jerry Seinfeld stvorio, ili je možda takav i u stvarnosti, izrodio je zvijezdu iz svakog lika samca koji se pojavio u nekom odnosu s njim. Jerry, George, Elaine i Kramer glavni su protagonisti "serije o ničemu". Rasprava hoće li Jerryjev noćni posjet postati nova romantična avantura, pljačka Jerryjevog stana, izbjegavanje susreta sa starim prijateljima do trgovine dionicama tek su neke od tema koje će zabaviti gledatelje u prvoj sezoni Seinfelda.</desc>

Iako se međusobno odlično razumiju, vanjski svijet je za njih zagonetka. Srećom, Pejdž Dinin (Katharine McPhee) ima mladog sina koji će ih "prevesti" u vanjski svijet. Svi pobjeđuju s ovim timom: svojom izuzetnom domišljatošću rješavaju nacionalne krize, pomažući sebi da se uklope u stvarni svijet.</desc>

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Seinfeld</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Serija "Seinfeld" opravdano se etablirala kao jedna od najuspješnijih i najpopularnijih humorističnih serija u povijesti televizije. Takozvana "serija o ničemu" uspjela je redefinirati žanr humorističnih serija gotovo preko noći. "Seinfeld" je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emmyja, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj malen u usporedbi s višemilijunskim auditorijem koji je svakog tjedna sjedao pred TV kako bi vidio što Njemu večeras smeta. Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Neurotičan lik kojeg je Jerry Seinfeld stvorio, ili je možda takav i u stvarnosti, izrodio je zvijezdu iz svakog lika samca koji se pojavio u nekom odnosu s njim. Jerry, George, Elaine i Kramer glavni su protagonisti "serije o ničemu". Rasprava hoće li Jerryjev noćni posjet postati nova romantična avantura, pljačka Jerryjevog stana, izbjegavanje susreta sa starim prijateljima do trgovine dionicama tek su neke od tema koje će zabaviti gledatelje u prvoj sezoni Seinfelda.</desc>

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>
