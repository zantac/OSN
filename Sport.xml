If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and "Wes Anderson-ey". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.\n\nThe story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a "canine flu" outbreak.\n\nFrom a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs.

If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and "Wes Anderson-ey". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.\n\nThe story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a "canine flu" outbreak.\n\nFrom a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs. The presentation of the story is very fresh and unique, and the humor is always smoothly intertwined with the narrative and visuals. With a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes, it flies by, always keeping your attention and further engaging you. The stop-motion animation is very well done, and the way it is contrasted with beautiful Japanese imagery is stunning. The soundtrack is also excellent, and aids in telling the story.

This is what happens when you watch a lot of movies. Every now and then a really bad movie seeps in that ruins your mood.\n\nI am going to start skipping movies if its says anything like...Film Canada or Film Ontario or Film Edmonton...basically anything associated with Canada is going to be a strict no for me henceforth. They will fund anything.\n\nHammer is the kind of script that should have been forgotten, left to rot and for nature to take its own course. A lot of paper and ink had already been wasted but no more Not a single unit of electricity should be wasted to shred the script. Not a single matchstick should be wasted to burn the script. The damage is already done. Enough money has already been wasted.\n\nAfter watching some of the movies that have been funded by Canada I am quite certain that if someone had approached them with the script of Waterworld they would have had a collective mental orgasm. If you are bottom of your class in a film-making course in a third world country you should seriously consider moving to Canada. You could be the absolute worst writer in the history of mankind...you could have written the worst story ever told in the history of mankind but if you are in Canada sooner or later you will get someone to throw some money your way.\n\nHammer is an 80 minute movie that feels like 4 hours. The Turkish film industry makes movies that are 3-4 hours long. Take the absolute worst Turkish movie ever made and it would still be better than Hammer. The script is clearly inspired by Breaking Bad. Will Patton is like Walter White if all you ever wished for was to punch Walter White every two minutes. The mother in this movie is so irritating that you would come to love Skylar White. Both father &amp; mother combine to raise two of the biggest donkeys in cinematic history.\n\nI personally think that Canadian movies should not be allowed to cross the border. If its funded by some silly organization in Canada it should be contained within Canada. Everyone who watched the movie is now dumber coz Canada sponsored a script that is almost as good as the entire storyline of the nursery rhyme "Jack &amp; Jill".\n\nWho are these people who make these type of movies? Why doesn't someone stop them? Who are these people who write these scripts? These are the kind of people who should be cursed like the tower of babel so that they dont speak/write the dialect of human beings anymore.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":562,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT1H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is what happens when you watch a lot of movies. Every now and then a really bad movie seeps in that ruins your mood.\n\nI am going to start skipping movies if its says anything like...Film Canada or Film Ontario or Film Edmonton...basically anything associated with Canada is going to be a strict no for me henceforth. They will fund anything.\n\nHammer is the kind of script that should have been forgotten, left to rot and for nature to take its own course. A lot of paper and ink had already been wasted but no more Not a single unit of electricity should be wasted to shred the script. Not a single matchstick should be wasted to burn the script. The damage is already done. Enough money has already been wasted.\n\nAfter watching some of the movies that have been funded by Canada I am quite certain that if someone had approached them with the script of Waterworld they would have had a collective mental orgasm. If you are bottom of your class in a film-making course in a third world country you should seriously consider moving to Canada. You could be the absolute worst writer in the history of mankind...you could have written the worst story ever told in the history of mankind but if you are in Canada sooner or later you will get someone to throw some money your way.\n\nHammer is an 80 minute movie that feels like 4 hours. The Turkish film industry makes movies that are 3-4 hours long. Take the absolute worst Turkish movie ever made and it would still be better than Hammer. The script is clearly inspired by Breaking Bad. Will Patton is like Walter White if all you ever wished for was to punch Walter White every two minutes. The mother in this movie is so irritating that you would come to love Skylar White. Both father &amp; mother combine to raise two of the biggest donkeys in cinematic history.\n\nI personally think that Canadian movies should not be allowed to cross the border. If its funded by some silly organization in Canada it should be contained within Canada. Everyone who watched the movie is now dumber coz Canada sponsored a script that is almost as good as the entire storyline of the nursery rhyme "Jack &amp; Jill".\n\nWho are these people who make these type of movies? Why doesn't someone stop them? Who are these people who write these scripts? These are the kind of people who should be cursed like the tower of babel so that they dont speak/write the dialect of human beings anymore.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":562,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT1H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Walsh, the director of Jump.\n\nThe film is set in the summer of 1998 during the Tour de France, which takes place in Ireland that year. The Belgian cyclist Dominique Chabol (Louis Talpe) is at the end of his sports career, but secretly hopes to be able to wear the yellow jersey. When Dominique offers less good speed records, he is kicked out of his team. Thus he loses hope of making his dream come true and prepares to leave his sports career behind. When another member of his old team is disqualified due to a doping error, Dominique gets his last chance to make his dream come true.\n\nThis film comes across as if you are looking at real images of the Tour de France with additional images of how the cyclists prepare for their races. The film is so entertaining and informative for cycling fans. You get a good view of what heavy things cyclists do to have a chance of winning a cycling race. In this way you also see how false it is when other cyclists use doping to win their races in an unfair way.\n\nA downside of this film is that you mainly follow the main character when he is kicked out of his cycling team, looking for a new way of life. He tries to improve his family life and to start a relationship with the doctor who cared for him. When he is allowed to return to his team towards the end of the film, he seems to be occupied with his own sports career and dreams again. The time you, as a viewer, spend after his sports career together with the main character, then appears somewhat aimless.\n\nThe acting is well done by the cast. Louis Talpe comes across well as a cyclist who chooses his career. It's just a shame that his character comes across a bit too selfish when he is allowed to return to his team. The rest of the cast gets a chance to shine as they help the main character with his life after his career. If he does choose his career again in the end, the time you spent with the rest of the cast also seems a bit unnecessary.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A film about Russia more than about a venerable woman. Beautiful in a sense than only by the Easterns can be understand, maybe defined. A story with mythical embroideries about lonely life, survive, injustice and a form of profound peace. Maybe, an useful testimony.

I used to be a super huge WWE fan from 1999-2011. By super huge I mean, I used to watch every show religiously and know everything about each athlete. I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.\n\nThe film tells the story of Saraya "Paige" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut. Paige's brother is devastated and Paige must deal with the drastic change in her life and the hard road to living out her dream.\n\nFlorence Pugh is already an established talent in my eyes because of her performance in Lady Macbeth. She's really fantastic in this, and disappears into the role of a WWE hopeful. The writing of Merchant and the care with which he gives to the comedy, the drama, and the heart involved in developing the characters is great. Its crazy to think that Merchant did not know a thing about wrestling before taking on the project. Side note: Merchant was in attendance at my screening for a Q and A and gave good insight into the project.\n\nThe film can't help feeling cliched. Training montage, sibling rivalry leading to a profound confrontation that resolves the issue, and the underdog overcoming the odds. I find it weird that real life Paige was just given the WWE Divas championship on her WWE debut but whatever. Overall, the film maintains a good balance of comedy and drama and you don't need to know anything about WWE or sports entertainment to enjoy the film. Merchant does a good job.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69684,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I used to be a super huge WWE fan from 1999-2011. By super huge I mean, I used to watch every show religiously and know everything about each athlete. I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.\n\nThe film tells the story of Saraya "Paige" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut. Paige's brother is devastated and Paige must deal with the drastic change in her life and the hard road to living out her dream.\n\nFlorence Pugh is already an established talent in my eyes because of her performance in Lady Macbeth. She's really fantastic in this, and disappears into the role of a WWE hopeful. The writing of Merchant and the care with which he gives to the comedy, the drama, and the heart involved in developing the characters is great. Its crazy to think that Merchant did not know a thing about wrestling before taking on the project. Side note: Merchant was in attendance at my screening for a Q and A and gave good insight into the project.\n\nThe film can't help feeling cliched. Training montage, sibling rivalry leading to a profound confrontation that resolves the issue, and the underdog overcoming the odds. I find it weird that real life Paige was just given the WWE Divas championship on her WWE debut but whatever. Overall, the film maintains a good balance of comedy and drama and you don't need to know anything about WWE or sports entertainment to enjoy the film. Merchant does a good job.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69684,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

This is not a movie made for a mass horror audience like the films made by Blumhouse or Atomic Monster, rather this is a character study with a no holds barred approach to its themes of lingering trauma and toxic religiosity. The film follows Aiden(Jaeden Martell) and Mia(Lia McHugh) who after the suicide of their mother Laura(Alicia Silverstone) live with their father Richard(Richard Armitage) and soon to be stepmother Grace (Riley Keough). Richard, needing to work through the holiday season arranges for the two to spend time with Grace at lodge in the woods that they frequent in the hopes that they will bond, but once there strange happenings coupled with the lingering resentment and bitterness felt by Aiden and Mia towards Grace for their mother's suicide a slow decent into terror begins.\n\nThe Lodge as horror film is very effective at building its mood and atmosphere. The titular lodge becomes a character itself with its empty halls, surrounding frozen landscapes, and generally sense of foreboding created by its minimal lighting and cavernous nature. Be it in the dark of the night or the light of day there is never any sense of comfort felt while in the lodge and a general feeling of unease permeates the film.\n\nThe characters aren't written with much in the way of depth, but they do effectively convey the feelings we expect given the circumstances. The crushing despair felt during the opening act's funeral, the mixture of boredom, restlessness, and unease felt during the second act, and finally the sheer terror and resignation that serves as the penultimate lead up to the films final moments. It's a movie where the minimalism is put to good use because it respects its audience enough not to through in a jump scare every few minutes.\n\nThe overall narrative deals with heavy themes of grief and religion as the two kids, Aiden and Mia, are devout Catholics as raised by their deceased mother Laura. Grace herself has distanced herself from religion later in life as her involvement with a extremist Christian cult left her with lingering trauma that serves as another point of contention between herself and the children. A key point in which the religious themes come into play is because the children are Catholic they believe their mothers soul will never be able to find peace.\n\nThe Lodge uses its themes of religiosity sparingly, and it's not so much of an indictment of religion itself, but more of the followers of said religions who twist what was once a well meaning doctrine into justification for acts of ugliness and barbarism that while not as explicitly graphic as your average Saw or Hostel film leave a haunting emptiness once we bear witness to the proceedings.\n\nWith that said however this movie will not be to everyone's taste. The movie is a slow burn with long stretches broken up by the occasional nightmare or sudden noise and there's very little dialogue among the characters so the audience will need to actively look for character in subtle interactions rather than through conversation. The films use of religious iconography may also seem insulting to some who feel themselves to be among the faithful but with that said I don't believe this film to carry any ill will towards the majority of Christians and it's more about those who twist the doctrine as justification for heinous actions. However the ending may leave some wondering where the film stands given where we eventually end up, but it does make a good topic of conversation for people to explore their differing views.\n\nThe Lodge is an effectively unsettling slow burn horror film that uses its minimalist aesthetics economically and effectively. From its effective performances to its barren landscapes and claustrophobic cinematography it'll leave viewers in a state of unease that makes them feel as though they're stuck in the titular lodge along side the characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning.

The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, "You have to be a moron to want to box."\n\nRocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before "Rocky" was "Weekend at Kitty and Stud's," and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in "Rocky." Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.\n\nStallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.\n\nHe lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.\n\nAfter he returns from his "job" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.\n\nBut things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. "An Italian found America," Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.\n\nBut Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music "Gonna Fly Now" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.\n\nThe most entertaining thing about "Rocky" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, "Are you sure she knows I'm coming?" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.\n\nAnd the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, "This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.\n\nThings like that are what make "Rocky" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.\n\nBut the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, "Rocky" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with "Rocky" all the more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":529290,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Often Irritating","reviewBody":"I'd heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me \n\nRidley Scott has been swotting up on the films and technique of David Lean and in many ways Scott is a natural successor to that legendary film director . The battle scenes are even better than the ones seen in Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING and at no time did I believe I was watching an unconvincing CGI battle fest , just an army of thousands of extras walloping each other over the head like you'd see in the greatest Hollywood epics of yesteryear . Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he's the sort of " movie star " who's only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film . The only thing that the director Can be criticised for is an over reliance of slow motion during the battle scenes but apart from that everything else on screen is Oscar worthy , though since Scott was under rewarded at award ceremonies you get the feeling that he was trying a little too hard to win an Oscar \n\nThere's an old saying that " if a film is good then it's down to the director and if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter " and this is certainly true of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN . Throughout the running time I was left scratching my head wondering about characters motives and why certain characters did certain things and let's not ignore the clichés of " You are a brave warrior so I will let you live " type moments . Some people claim that the studio should be held responsible rather than screenwriter William Monahan since they made several cuts to the final print and there's a disjointed feel to the narrative . Perhaps this is true but I wonder how many people watching this on DVD or on television like me had to keep logging in to the wikipedia in order to understand what was happening on screen . It should also be pointed out that there's a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil . One wonders if the knight templars were still in existence today if they'd be shown in this way . In many ways it's like watching a second world war film where Germans are shown as being as much as victims of Nazism as those in the occupied territories . Honestly I was expecting the templars to goose step in to battle while proclaiming " I vos only obeying orders " . It says something about the quality of director and cast when they can rise above such one dimensional scripting \n\nIn short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it . Historians probably won't like it and you get the feeling no one will love KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and everyone will give slightly different reasons as to why they didn't love it . In short it's a very flawed masterpiece","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271337,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Often Irritating","reviewBody":"I'd heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me \n\nRidley Scott has been swotting up on the films and technique of David Lean and in many ways Scott is a natural successor to that legendary film director . The battle scenes are even better than the ones seen in Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING and at no time did I believe I was watching an unconvincing CGI battle fest , just an army of thousands of extras walloping each other over the head like you'd see in the greatest Hollywood epics of yesteryear . Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he's the sort of " movie star " who's only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film . The only thing that the director Can be criticised for is an over reliance of slow motion during the battle scenes but apart from that everything else on screen is Oscar worthy , though since Scott was under rewarded at award ceremonies you get the feeling that he was trying a little too hard to win an Oscar \n\nThere's an old saying that " if a film is good then it's down to the director and if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter " and this is certainly true of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN . Throughout the running time I was left scratching my head wondering about characters motives and why certain characters did certain things and let's not ignore the clichés of " You are a brave warrior so I will let you live " type moments . Some people claim that the studio should be held responsible rather than screenwriter William Monahan since they made several cuts to the final print and there's a disjointed feel to the narrative . Perhaps this is true but I wonder how many people watching this on DVD or on television like me had to keep logging in to the wikipedia in order to understand what was happening on screen . It should also be pointed out that there's a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil . One wonders if the knight templars were still in existence today if they'd be shown in this way . In many ways it's like watching a second world war film where Germans are shown as being as much as victims of Nazism as those in the occupied territories . Honestly I was expecting the templars to goose step in to battle while proclaiming " I vos only obeying orders " . It says something about the quality of director and cast when they can rise above such one dimensional scripting \n\nIn short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it . Historians probably won't like it and you get the feeling no one will love KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and everyone will give slightly different reasons as to why they didn't love it . In short it's a very flawed masterpiece","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271337,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, "You have to be a moron to want to box."\n\nRocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before "Rocky" was "Weekend at Kitty and Stud's," and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in "Rocky." Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.\n\nStallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.\n\nHe lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.\n\nAfter he returns from his "job" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.\n\nBut things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. "An Italian found America," Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.\n\nBut Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music "Gonna Fly Now" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.\n\nThe most entertaining thing about "Rocky" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, "Are you sure she knows I'm coming?" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.\n\nAnd the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, "This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.\n\nThings like that are what make "Rocky" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.\n\nBut the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, "Rocky" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with "Rocky" all the more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":529290,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't ever really think about cinematography- I go into a movie, watch it, and don't think much about the filming style. But in this movie the filming style is so bad that it's distracting. The entire movie is very dark- yes for some unknown reason it's all in the dark. Even the daytime scenes everyone is shrouded in shadows. So that kinda sucks. And then also all the conversations in this movie seem to be shot in profile. We only ever see the sides of people's faces. I'd love to get just one shot of someone's entire face. Like an actual face, with eyes, that is well lit, that would be great. But you're not gonna get that in this movie! You're actually not going to see an entire head in almost any scene. All the heads will be either from very far away or very close up so you'll see from the neck to the eyebrows only but not the actual top of anyone's heads and NEVER the front of their face- only the profile! I'm not even going to comment on the plot it's kinda bla or whatever but I'm halfway through the movie while writing this and just looking at this dark and terrible filming style. As I'm writing this Im also thinking, "Am I exaggerating?" But no I am not because every single time I glance up at the screen I see close ups of people's side profiles in shadow. Every scene. I don't need to keep seeing Shailene Woodley's ears. Also Jamie Dornan is a gorgeous man and we never actually get to see a shot of his whole face this entire frickin movie! Why even have someone so gorgeous in so many scenes and only show bits of pieces of face? Why is the cinematographer doing this to us?

I don't ever really think about cinematography- I go into a movie, watch it, and don't think much about the filming style. But in this movie the filming style is so bad that it's distracting. The entire movie is very dark- yes for some unknown reason it's all in the dark. Even the daytime scenes everyone is shrouded in shadows. So that kinda sucks. And then also all the conversations in this movie seem to be shot in profile. We only ever see the sides of people's faces. I'd love to get just one shot of someone's entire face. Like an actual face, with eyes, that is well lit, that would be great. But you're not gonna get that in this movie! You're actually not going to see an entire head in almost any scene. All the heads will be either from very far away or very close up so you'll see from the neck to the eyebrows only but not the actual top of anyone's heads and NEVER the front of their face- only the profile! I'm not even going to comment on the plot it's kinda bla or whatever but I'm halfway through the movie while writing this and just looking at this dark and terrible filming style. As I'm writing this Im also thinking, "Am I exaggerating?" But no I am not because every single time I glance up at the screen I see close ups of people's side profiles in shadow. Every scene. I don't need to keep seeing Shailene Woodley's ears. Also Jamie Dornan is a gorgeous man and we never actually get to see a shot of his whole face this entire frickin movie! Why even have someone so gorgeous in so many scenes and only show bits of pieces of face? Why is the cinematographer doing this to us? Whyyyy?!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I would have liked to have delved deeper into the Greater Romania thing. I know that present days Romania has chunks of what Hungary calls its own and Moldova the same. It didn't show how the monarchy's of Central Europe after WWI where doomed by their own weakness. In the movie its mentioned that the Royal Family of Romania are German Princess given the job because had nothing to do after the unification of Germany in 1871. But back to the movie, really the only ones who seem to be able to tell these stories in modern cinema are the European co-productions. They have a feel and of course the wonderful locations are no harm. the lovely scene near the end between Ferdinand and Marie at the castle was just gorgeous and ended the movies in a lovely way.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1774,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I would have liked to have delved deeper into the Greater Romania thing. I know that present days Romania has chunks of what Hungary calls its own and Moldova the same. It didn't show how the monarchy's of Central Europe after WWI where doomed by their own weakness. In the movie its mentioned that the Royal Family of Romania are German Princess given the job because had nothing to do after the unification of Germany in 1871. But back to the movie, really the only ones who seem to be able to tell these stories in modern cinema are the European co-productions. They have a feel and of course the wonderful locations are no harm. the lovely scene near the end between Ferdinand and Marie at the castle was just gorgeous and ended the movies in a lovely way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1774,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

My curiosity was peaked as I was a fan of the original TV show when I was a kid, and really enjoyed the first Charlie's Angel's movie, but Full Throttle, not so much, so I rented it. I understand with all the A-list stars doing TV shows it's hard to get them for films, I just expected bigger casting for this as it was a successful franchise. Jane, the Lucy Liu replacement is nice to look at but is about as bland as cardboard and her acting is not much better. When she was crying in a scene I thought she was faking it because it was so bad it seemed like a joke. Elena, who is the Drew Barrymore replacement looks like a Sarah Michelle Gellar knockoff with little of SMG's Buffy charm and quips. She's just kind of bland. She seems more suited for sit-coms where not as much is expected of her. I liked K Stew, and she had some moments in here, but, the script and the actresses she was working against didn't give her much to work with.\n\nBasically, the way they've been doing movies for the past 5+ years of doing action sequence storyboards with the director, then hire a screenwriter later does not work. Movies have just been sucking hard. I find so many action films frivolous and boring. I haven't outgrown them, 'cause every once in a while there will be a good one, like John Wick, or a fun one, like the Jumanji reboot. This was pretty light on action for an Angels movie and the action there was you couldn't see any of it 'cause all the shots were tight. And the weird scene with the gatlin gun in the Jeep was just the villain taking a shot, then Jane, then villain, then back and forth. It was really poorly done and I'm not buying anyone would go to such extremes to kill a civilian like Elena. It came off very cartoonish.\n\nThe only scene in the entire movie I liked was when all the girls dressed alike. That was fun. But that was it. I was just bored. I didn't want to finish it but I did. They really hammered the whole girl power, men are pigs thing a bit too much. It's like, I get it. It would have been nice to give the audience a little more credit that we don't need a hammer to the head. I found it more regressive than progressive. Funny that I feel like the one from 19 years ago was more empowering than this one that clearly was supposed to be a feminist trope. The 2000 version had villains but it wasn't men bad women good. The 2019 version was much too female neanderthal for my taste.\n\nAnd what was with all the killing and deaths? I don't remember anyone dying in the old versions. Charlie's Angels is supposed to be fun and light. Definitely not appropriate for young girls, which is when I was first introduced to the franchise. It's a shame. Take away, despite the Pitch Perfect franchise being fantastic, and Elizabeth Banks a really talented actress, action is not for everybody. Comedy and action films are made very differently and you need to understand stunts, storyboarding, VFX, green screens, etc. There's a lot more to it. I just think she took on too much before she was ready. I would like to see more of her work, this was just not a win. I did like her in Brightburn. Now, that was much better than expected.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

My curiosity was peaked as I was a fan of the original TV show when I was a kid, and really enjoyed the first Charlie's Angel's movie, but Full Throttle, not so much, so I rented it. I understand with all the A-list stars doing TV shows it's hard to get them for films, I just expected bigger casting for this as it was a successful franchise. Jane, the Lucy Liu replacement is nice to look at but is about as bland as cardboard and her acting is not much better. When she was crying in a scene I thought she was faking it because it was so bad it seemed like a joke. Elena, who is the Drew Barrymore replacement looks like a Sarah Michelle Gellar knockoff with little of SMG's Buffy charm and quips. She's just kind of bland. She seems more suited for sit-coms where not as much is expected of her. I liked K Stew, and she had some moments in here, but, the script and the actresses she was working against didn't give her much to work with.\n\nBasically, the way they've been doing movies for the past 5+ years of doing action sequence storyboards with the director, then hire a screenwriter later does not work. Movies have just been sucking hard. I find so many action films frivolous and boring. I haven't outgrown them, 'cause every once in a while there will be a good one, like John Wick, or a fun one, like the Jumanji reboot. This was pretty light on action for an Angels movie and the action there was you couldn't see any of it 'cause all the shots were tight. And the weird scene with the gatlin gun in the Jeep was just the villain taking a shot, then Jane, then villain, then back and forth. It was really poorly done and I'm not buying anyone would go to such extremes to kill a civilian like Elena. It came off very cartoonish.\n\nThe only scene in the entire movie I liked was when all the girls dressed alike. That was fun. But that was it. I was just bored. I didn't want to finish it but I did. They really hammered the whole girl power, men are pigs thing a bit too much. It's like, I get it. It would have been nice to give the audience a little more credit that we don't need a hammer to the head. I found it more regressive than progressive. Funny that I feel like the one from 19 years ago was more empowering than this one that clearly was supposed to be a feminist trope. The 2000 version had villains but it wasn't men bad women good. The 2019 version was much too female neanderthal for my taste.\n\nAnd what was with all the killing and deaths? I don't remember anyone dying in the old versions. Charlie's Angels is supposed to be fun and light. Definitely not appropriate for young girls, which is when I was first introduced to the franchise. It's a shame. Take away, despite the Pitch Perfect franchise being fantastic, and Elizabeth Banks a really talented actress, action is not for everybody. Comedy and action films are made very differently and you need to understand stunts, storyboarding, VFX, green screens, etc. There's a lot more to it. I just think she took on too much before she was ready. I would like to see more of her work, this was just not a win. I did like her in Brightburn. Now, that was much better than expected.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To the joys and pains of being alive.\n\nI can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.\n\nTo watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.\n\nThank you, Pixar.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408563,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It's an odd pairing, but at least you can say these guys have range. To helm this film, about a hit-man whose drinking problem has caused sloppiness and perhaps the demise of his Polish gang in Buffalo, we have John Dahl. I am a huge fan of Rounders, so I was hoping for some of the same here, with a dramatic arc that worked and made sense intelligently, but also bringing the laughs that the trailer promised. Thankfully this film doesn't disappoint. Yes, there are some moments of disbelief, but the dry, straight-laced delivery of everything else makes up for the leaps in logic that would otherwise eat at me for the duration. While not laugh-out-loud funny, Dahl has put together a nice slow burning comedy that allows its characters to live and breathe realistically and evolve in a somewhat believable manner.\n\nOur aforementioned hit-man is played brilliantly by Ben Kingsley. I remember when I used to look at him as just Ghandi, but after the diverse catalog of films he has done recently, I've realized that he isn't afraid to branch out into darker fare. His role here has a lot going for it in comedic termshe is an alcoholic, a loner that kills for money, and a resident of the arctic pole of Buffalo. Put all that together and you can think of a few funny situations for him to get into. To the filmmakers' credit, though, we never really get any of that except for the opening "job." When Kingsley's Frank sleeps through the one big job he is relied on to do, everything falls apart. What happens next is his journey to sobriety and friendship/love to pull him through to an understanding about what he really is living for. What worked for a film like The Matador couldn't be as effective here. Frank isn't having a nervous breakdown or losing his cool, he is off the job seeking help so that he can go back on the payroll. We don't need him to drunkenly wave a loaded gun at people, the comedy instead comes from his fish-out-of-water situation, being a cold-hearted killer trying to warm up to recovering alcoholics and a community he is not used to being sober around.\n\nKingsley definitely plays the role to perfection, never faltering from his matter-of-fact tone or takes no crap attitude. Everything out of his mouth is carefully orchestrated and he is not one to waste his own or others' time. This fact makes some scenes hilarious because of the reactions from those he is speaking to. When he speaks from the heart and seriously, while sprinkling in his own experiences murdering people, during AA meetings, the utter silence and occasional Amen from the audience is gold. Besides his unfaltering demeanor and his sardonic sarcasm, it is when he plays off of love interest Téa Leoni when some of the best laughs occur. These two have a wonderful rapport and when they go at each other rapid fire, with one quip/comeback after another, you'd think it was all ad-libbedthe timing is that good. Leoni has been surprising me lately with her career. I don't know why I used to think she was annoying, but recently having seen films like House of D and her early work in Flirting With Disaster, I realize that she is good at both the dramatic and the comedic.\n\nThe who's who of supporting players also does a nice job anchoring the story. Luke Wilson seems to really just be playing himself, but the laidback friend is what is needed for the role. Philip Baker Hall and Dennis Farina show how it's done as two rival mob bosses in Buffalo, (yes, I said mob bosses in Buffalo, I'm constantly scared for my life when walking around downtown at night). Their storyline is handled well and counteracts the subtle humor going on at rehab in San Francisco with some tense moments trying to keep the Polish afloat at the hands of the ever increasing Irish crew. Mention is also needed for Bill Pullman who has been making some good choices of late in small supporting roles. His self-absorbed real estate agent is entertaining because his ego won't let him be intimidated by the killer he is conversing with.\n\nThe laughs may not come over and over again, but when they do it's smartly and appropriately. The fact that everyone in San Fran who hears Kingsley is a hit-man just accept it like someone saying they washed their clothes that morning is a bit rough to get by, but really it doesn't matter in terms of plot progression. The writers also try to distill the problem with Frank saying how it's Alcoholics "Anonymous," which brings a smile to your face for nothing more than the corniness of the line. I also don't know how perfect placing the movie in Buffalo was. It seems the writers needed a cold, drinking town up north and our wonderful home of Buffalo was the first to come to their heads. When was the last time you heard about the Irish and Polish mob going to war while the Greeks stood back to see who came out on top? Yeah, that's right, never. I did like the touch of hometown words by naming an Irish bar Scajaqueda. Just proves again these guys had no clue what they were doing with location. Overall, though, the film works despite any of its shortcomings.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17980,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

James Bond 007 action film the best one that was ever made. In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.\n\nI'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get's bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction from Martin Campbell. The stunts are completely insane in scale in this movie and really dangerous.\n\nMusic score is by Éric Serra, the title song is GoldenEye performed by Tina Turner. GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond: Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.\n\nStyle and sophistication are in abundance - - "The name's Bond. James Bond." \n\nGoldeneye's female characters are honestly beautiful with particular techniques. The bad one is Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an ex-Soviet fighter pilot who tranquilly smokes big cigars and knocks off her victims with her 'killer thighs.' In one scene, she challenges Bond's legendary Aston Martin DB5 to a wild road race outside Monte Carlo with her red Ferrari: in another she was so smart that she snatches a top-secret helicopter from under the noses of the French navy. \n\nIzabella Scorupco is a great and the finest Bond girl, the irresistible Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) who 'tastes like strawberries.' Natalya possesses all the technical ability to neutralize Janus' scheme or to destroy all computer records with the GoldenEye As one who survived a mass murder, this lovely beauty is suddenly a marked woman.\n\nJames Bond investigates the theft of the control disk for the GoldenEye satellite. His investigation leads to an organization of arms dealers Janus and the reappearance of someone from Bond's past. James Bond must deal with betrayal of his old friend Alec Trevelyan (006) gone rogue, from using a satellite GoldenEye against London to cause a global financial meltdown\n\nWhy I also love this movie to death beside the action is because of the great villains who created evil characters. Such as: Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006), Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp: A Georgian lust murderer, Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko: A computer programmer.\n\nIt was filmed in beautiful locations in Puerto Rico, Russia, England, UK and in the France.\n\nThe movie has a lot of insane hard-core action (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), The stunts are completely insane in scale (bungee jumping in - Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility a stunt man performed that stunt in the opening scene.) Bond with a motorcycle jumps on a plane and catches it. Bond drives a tank in Russia for the first time and he demolishes even police cars that was excellent scene. Bond a stuntman jumps out of the window in Russia. Alec Trevelyan's train depot - exploding train. The epic climatic fight on the end of the movie between Bond and Trevelyan in his secret Goldeneye satellite control dish in Cuba in which Bond drops Trevelyan out of dish beautiful and really crazy stunt performance.\n\nI love the soundtracks in this movie: Goldeneye by Tina Turner and The Experience of Love by Éric Serra. I just love everything about this movie from the actions, to the heroes, to the villains from acting everything abut this movie I just love so much.\n\nGoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.\n\n10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":242005,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When he learned "Zathura" would be the next Van Allsburg book to come to the screen, he made me promise we'd see it.\n\nWe nearly missed our chance (it was at the second-run theater) but I am glad we made it. "Zathura" was excellent- we were riveted the entire time and my son THEN made me promise we'd buy the DVD when it was released! Since one of the main characters was a 10-year old boy like him, naturally I knew he'd like it. But I really liked it too and thought that every actor's performance was exactly right. Not cutesy in that "movie kid" kind of way, but very real. I flinched at some of the older brother's dialogue- it was so mean and angry toward the little brother. But that's how it is!! Kids are so mean. This movie did not shy away from it (OK, that set up the ending, but still).\n\nEven the teen sister was great. Tim Robbins, as the harried dad (little screen time) was spot-on. Families of divorce have a whole separate set of behavioral rules to learn and live by, and this movie nailed it.\n\nThumbs-up from all of us!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95865,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When he learned "Zathura" would be the next Van Allsburg book to come to the screen, he made me promise we'd see it.\n\nWe nearly missed our chance (it was at the second-run theater) but I am glad we made it. "Zathura" was excellent- we were riveted the entire time and my son THEN made me promise we'd buy the DVD when it was released! Since one of the main characters was a 10-year old boy like him, naturally I knew he'd like it. But I really liked it too and thought that every actor's performance was exactly right. Not cutesy in that "movie kid" kind of way, but very real. I flinched at some of the older brother's dialogue- it was so mean and angry toward the little brother. But that's how it is!! Kids are so mean. This movie did not shy away from it (OK, that set up the ending, but still).\n\nEven the teen sister was great. Tim Robbins, as the harried dad (little screen time) was spot-on. Families of divorce have a whole separate set of behavioral rules to learn and live by, and this movie nailed it.\n\nThumbs-up from all of us!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95865,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It's charming and exquisitely detailed, and it succeeds where it really counts: It makes you really feel for the lovable lead penguin, Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood).\n\nMumble is an unfortunate penguin, you see, because was born with no singing ability, and in his penguin tribe one attracts a mate through the use of song. The poor flightless bird can only look on helplessly as his fellow hatchlings croon their little hearts out. Amazingly, though, Mumble can tap dance, a big no-no in the penguin community. Soon, with no heart song to guide him, Mumble isn't permitted to graduate from school, to the chagrin of his Elvis-like dad (Hugh Jackman) and his songbird-like mom (Nicole Kidman).\n\nMumble heart belongs to the best singer in his age group, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), but without the gift of song he can't hope to woo her. Worse, with the penguins' food supply running out, some of the other birds begin to blame Mumble's foot-tapping, that somehow he is angering the great god Guin. The sad-sack penguin is then drummed out of the penguin corps, shunned for his lack of song and strength of feet, and he runs into another penguin colony, one that uses pebbles to woo their females instead of song, and makes new friends - a Latino-sounding quartet that's high on life, full of zest and pizazz and charisma, everything that Mumble's old group isn't.\n\nThen Mumble hears from some predator birds of mysterious "aliens" who probe and attach tags to their victims. Mumble thinks these aliens might have something to do with the lack of fishies for everyone to munch on, so he and his new pals head off on a Quest to find these aliens and ask them to stop stealing all the fish.\n\nSome of the scenes are beautifully imagined, including attacks by sea lions (quite harrowing, actually, until its denouement), vultures, and killer whales, not to mention every time Mumble and/or his posse leap off a cliff and slide down the side like avian sleds. Or through ice tunnels. Or through the water itself, shooting like streaming jetliners with mile-long contrails. Gorgeous animation.\n\nAt its heart, the movie is about how it's okay to Be Different. It's about how older folks sometimes hold prejudices that are as illogical as they are insulting, and how they'll often pass along those prejudices to their children, sometimes through direct actions and sometimes by dint of their inaction when wrongs are being perpetuated.\n\nRobin Williams takes on four roles in this movie: the Narrator (where he's excellent and not at all hammy), Ramon and Cletus (two of the feisty new penguins), and Lovelace, a self-professed penguin guru to whom penguins go to have their problems solved. On the one hand, Williams is delightful doing what he does best, improvising rapid-fire comic patter to get laughs; on the other hand, he's Robin Williams, and although there are differences between his voice characterizations, they all bear a strong resemblance to one another. As with most animated films, the movie is well-cast; Jackman is particular has an appealing Southern drawl (ironically, he and Kidman are Aussies playing penguins with southern accents).\n\nIn the wake of the phenomenal, surprise success of March of the Penguins, Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. It'll be very difficult not to shed a tear at the mistreatment of Mumble by his peers and his elders, and it'll be near impossible to thoroughly enjoy this dazzling animated offering.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173196,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And, for the most part, it succeeds at continuing a trend of mostly-good DC Superhero TV on the CW. Helped along by several characters that have earned us caring about them from their development on Arrow and The Flash, Victor Garber's Martin Stein, Caity Lotz's Sarah Lance, and Brandon Routh's Ray Palmer ground the show with enough heart to kick-start it into action.\n\nMeanwhile, Snart and Rory continue to play the well characterized pair of funny anti-heroes that we have seen again and again on the other CW shows. In particular, Captain Cold's absurdly dry sense of humor and knack for puns cuts through moments of necessary pilot exposition.\n\nThe real standout, though, is Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, whose sharp comedic timing and deeper acting chops should help keep the show grounded in a strong protagonist moving forward. The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted. Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to be as trite and uninteresting as they were during their stint on The Flash. And despite the potential in Vandal Savage as a character, his writing thus far has not been nuanced or compelling enough to set him on par with CW's other seasonal "Big Bads".\n\nMoving forward, the show should succeed if it focuses on its characters and actors that elevate it above mere comic book cheese, and if it executes its promise of time-travel shenanigans in inventive, fun ways.\n\nLegends of Tomorrow doesn't look poised to knock The Flash from its "best in DC" throne just yet. The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance). Consistency will be Legends of Tomorrow's biggest challenge if it wants to one-up The Flash and legitimize future expansion of CW's DC Universe. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I gave it a 6 because it will do, for this viewer who is addicted to all things space, until other shows come along.

Pinhead even begins to look human at this point showing the "bad guys" in a different light. Before long the demons actually become the "good guys", and temporarily co-exist with Kirsty to counter the evil Doctor's hand over hell.\n\nThe violence and gore offered by Hellbound is excessive and delivered to the viewer in such horrific, profane ways it has definitely had an impact on its viewing demographic. Barker made a great job of communicating to the director his view of the film from a novel and it's a gruesome one. So gruesome it will immediately turn away many within the opening minutes.\n\nI recommend this movie for anyone who's into horror or those who think the genre is just Hostel and Saw. Hellbound, as indeed the original, breathes new life into the horror movie and for every pint of spilled blood, brings intelligence and style in buckets.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Meanwile a man (Bill Pullman) commits suicide dropping himself from a high apartment. Karen Davis (Sara Michelle Gellar) a volunteer social agrees to cover another assistant. He goes to the ghastly house and find an elderly woman (Grace Zabrinski.) Then happen several flashbacks about the family (Clea Duvall, her husband and his sister KaDee Strickland). A series of terrible and mysterious deaths occur. A Police Inspector (Ryo Ishibashi) attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery. But Karen is also racing to saves her boyfriend (Jason Behr) and must now find to break the horrifying spell.\n\nThis frightening movie displays terror, shocks, hard-edged drama and creepy images. While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan. Nice cinematography by Yamamoto, Takashi Miike usual cameraman. Well produced in Japan by Robert G. Tapert and Sam Raimi and of course with intervention his brother Ted Raimi, as always. The motion picture is professionally directed by Takashi Shimzu in similar style to Hideo Nakata movies -The ring, Dark Water-. Shimzu is an expert on horror cinema with creepy phantoms of pale complexion and long hair .

Meanwile a man (Bill Pullman) commits suicide dropping himself from a high apartment. Karen Davis (Sara Michelle Gellar) a volunteer social agrees to cover another assistant. He goes to the ghastly house and find an elderly woman (Grace Zabrinski.) Then happen several flashbacks about the family (Clea Duvall, her husband and his sister KaDee Strickland). A series of terrible and mysterious deaths occur. A Police Inspector (Ryo Ishibashi) attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery. But Karen is also racing to saves her boyfriend (Jason Behr) and must now find to break the horrifying spell.\n\nThis frightening movie displays terror, shocks, hard-edged drama and creepy images. While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan. Nice cinematography by Yamamoto, Takashi Miike usual cameraman. Well produced in Japan by Robert G. Tapert and Sam Raimi and of course with intervention his brother Ted Raimi, as always. The motion picture is professionally directed by Takashi Shimzu in similar style to Hideo Nakata movies -The ring, Dark Water-. Shimzu is an expert on horror cinema with creepy phantoms of pale complexion and long hair . After that, he made ¨Reincarnation¨ also called ¨Rinne¨ again with palish phantoms and ¨Marebito¨ about a vampire in the Tokyo underground. It's followed by Grudge II again with Sara Michelle Gellar and Amber Tamblyn and similar equipment technical and artistic ; furthermore in production the third part.

    <desc lang="pl">Zimny poranek w odkrywkowej kopalni kruszców. Krzysztof (Grzegorz Damięcki) zaczyna pierwszy dzień pracy na stanowisku kierownika. Wyraźnie nie pasuje on do środowiska pracowników fizycznych. W trosce o własną pozycję, zamierza trzymać dyscyplinę twardą ręką. Nagły wypadek, którego ofiarą staje się jeden z ukraińskich robotników, wystawia zasady moralne Krzysztofa na próbę. Zdaje on sobie sprawę z tego, że łatwo być stanowczym tylko w sprzyjających okolicznościach. Jednak trudno mu przeciwstawić się złu, kiedy w grę wchodzą dramatyczne konsekwencje.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Młoda ucieka z domu jak najdalej od smutnej, bezbarwnej miejscowości. Szybko okazuje się, że podróż autostopem nie jest tak ekscytująca, jak się wydawało, kiedy znajduje się w środku nocy na obrzeżach postkomunistycznego miasta. Dziewczyna dostrzega na moście postać, która niebezpiecznie balansuje na barierce. Tak poznaje niezrównoważonego dziwaka Chudego. Oboje postanawiają na jakiś czas obrać taki sam kierunek podróży. Pod osłoną nocy snują się po mieście, w coraz dziwniejsze rejony, doświadczając niezwykłych emocji. Wkrótce między Młodą a Chudym tworzy się nienazwana więź. Całość oparta jest na płaszczyźnie psychodelicznej jak z narkotycznego transu.</desc>

Music can arouse feelings and aspirations, stories might evoke similar events in our own experience and throw new light on them, and great paintings can reach out to the sublime within us, taking us beyond the mundane for a brief moment of time. There is a creative element in each of us that goes beyond reasoning; the flash of inner genius; the illumination of the soul. The question of how to awaken that in adolescents preparing for Oxford or Cambridge is one that admits of no straightforward answer, though the teachers portrayed in The History Boys approach it from a number of angles, provoking philosophical challenges to the audience about the nature of education. Add to that the theme of awakening sexuality and at least one teacher who confabulates both strands with his personal sexual desires, and you have an entertaining story, even before adding the side-splitting, intelligent humour.\n\nThe beauty - and also the shortfall - of The History Boys is that people who are steeped in theatre made it. With the modern genius of playwright Alan Bennett transferring stage to screen we can be grateful that his masterpieces will reach a wider audience. But this is Bennett-lite, and almost makes us long for the original, full-length work. There is a notable absence of cinematic flourish - use of lighting, camera-work, images and subtleties unique to the silver screen that could have lifted the spirit of The History Boys to something that is beyond the physical limitations of the original stage. There is nothing here that could not have been portrayed equally well there - which leads us to conclude that, apart from it being a more accessible medium, the film is nothing more than a shortened and only mildly adjusted copy of the play. All the actors have the same, excellent projection of voice and perfect intonation that carries well for a live performance but that lacks the sense of intimacy which the camera can bring. Facial expressions are slightly overemphasised, as befitting the stage, but lacking the subtlety usually required for good cinema. At times it sounds too much like a recitation or performance, resulting in an audience detachment that comes from not quite being able to believe in the reality of characters before us or the emotions they are going through. Director Nicholas Hytner (Center Stage, The Crucible, The Madness of King George) also has his roots firmly in theatre, yet his choice of subject matter has generally been so outstanding that he has reaped awards in spite of this clunky, stagey style (the one exception being The Object of My Affection - which was less well critically received). The History Boys is obvious BAFTA-bait but, like the Madness of King George, its pluses fortunately outshine its weaknesses, and the story, humour and intellectual substance are so engaging that you can be guaranteed lots of discussion afterwards with your fellow filmgoers.\n\nIn 1998, Bennett (who graduated from Exeter College Oxford in Medieval History) refused an honorary doctorate from Oxford in protest at its links with press baron Rupert Murdoch. If anybody has the background to tell an outrageously authentic and rebellious tale of a-list history students with homo-erotic leanings it must surely be Bennett. He skilfully navigates the ground between appealing to a predominantly gay audience and a mainstream one by sublimating much of the homosexual content beneath the time-honoured stiff upper lip of English public school tradition, and then including hilarious heterosexual content that makes seducing a woman into a war-game. Gilded epigrams, quotable quotes and the most stylish of double-entendres ('gobbets') flood our ears as the boys' literary skills are augmented with the most ingenious of schoolboy deceptions. An ad-libbed enactment of a brothel scene for a French class (where one of the lads removes his trousers for added realism) is transformed seamlessly to a battle front drama when the headmaster makes a surprise appearance. Literary references leap from Thomas Hardy and Keats to Brief Encounter and Carry On films, and this mind-enhancing (if questionable) juxtaposition is faultlessly analysed.

Music can arouse feelings and aspirations, stories might evoke similar events in our own experience and throw new light on them, and great paintings can reach out to the sublime within us, taking us beyond the mundane for a brief moment of time. There is a creative element in each of us that goes beyond reasoning; the flash of inner genius; the illumination of the soul. The question of how to awaken that in adolescents preparing for Oxford or Cambridge is one that admits of no straightforward answer, though the teachers portrayed in The History Boys approach it from a number of angles, provoking philosophical challenges to the audience about the nature of education. Add to that the theme of awakening sexuality and at least one teacher who confabulates both strands with his personal sexual desires, and you have an entertaining story, even before adding the side-splitting, intelligent humour.\n\nThe beauty - and also the shortfall - of The History Boys is that people who are steeped in theatre made it. With the modern genius of playwright Alan Bennett transferring stage to screen we can be grateful that his masterpieces will reach a wider audience. But this is Bennett-lite, and almost makes us long for the original, full-length work. There is a notable absence of cinematic flourish - use of lighting, camera-work, images and subtleties unique to the silver screen that could have lifted the spirit of The History Boys to something that is beyond the physical limitations of the original stage. There is nothing here that could not have been portrayed equally well there - which leads us to conclude that, apart from it being a more accessible medium, the film is nothing more than a shortened and only mildly adjusted copy of the play. All the actors have the same, excellent projection of voice and perfect intonation that carries well for a live performance but that lacks the sense of intimacy which the camera can bring. Facial expressions are slightly overemphasised, as befitting the stage, but lacking the subtlety usually required for good cinema. At times it sounds too much like a recitation or performance, resulting in an audience detachment that comes from not quite being able to believe in the reality of characters before us or the emotions they are going through. Director Nicholas Hytner (Center Stage, The Crucible, The Madness of King George) also has his roots firmly in theatre, yet his choice of subject matter has generally been so outstanding that he has reaped awards in spite of this clunky, stagey style (the one exception being The Object of My Affection - which was less well critically received). The History Boys is obvious BAFTA-bait but, like the Madness of King George, its pluses fortunately outshine its weaknesses, and the story, humour and intellectual substance are so engaging that you can be guaranteed lots of discussion afterwards with your fellow filmgoers.\n\nIn 1998, Bennett (who graduated from Exeter College Oxford in Medieval History) refused an honorary doctorate from Oxford in protest at its links with press baron Rupert Murdoch. If anybody has the background to tell an outrageously authentic and rebellious tale of a-list history students with homo-erotic leanings it must surely be Bennett. He skilfully navigates the ground between appealing to a predominantly gay audience and a mainstream one by sublimating much of the homosexual content beneath the time-honoured stiff upper lip of English public school tradition, and then including hilarious heterosexual content that makes seducing a woman into a war-game. Gilded epigrams, quotable quotes and the most stylish of double-entendres ('gobbets') flood our ears as the boys' literary skills are augmented with the most ingenious of schoolboy deceptions. An ad-libbed enactment of a brothel scene for a French class (where one of the lads removes his trousers for added realism) is transformed seamlessly to a battle front drama when the headmaster makes a surprise appearance. Literary references leap from Thomas Hardy and Keats to Brief Encounter and Carry On films, and this mind-enhancing (if questionable) juxtaposition is faultlessly analysed. The question of 'what is history' is pursued with some vigour, from the idea of 'subjunctive history' to Rudge's down to earth if academically challenged definition - just one effing thing after another. Different intellectual approaches are personified by teachers Hector (knowledge for its own sake, whether it seems useful or not), Irwin (flashes of insight and creativeness that stand out from the usual interpretations) and Mrs Lintott (who suggests radical reinterpretation from a feminist point of view, instead of history being the story of men's inadequate responses told from the point of view of other men).\n\nIf all this sounds like an overly cerebral experience, be assured that it races past so quickly that paying attention to the academic content is an optional extra. Lighter viewing can tune in unashamedly to the in-your-face humour, a great soundtrack (The Smiths, New Order, The Clash, The Cure) and additional musical interludes as the lads leap to an old piano and acquit themselves admirably with camp song routines.\n\nLike the similarly highbrow Dead Poets Society and The Browning Version or the more basic Dangerous Minds, The History Boys relies for its emotional ballast on the familiar themes of seeing a successful adult in a promising student, and the frailty of the teaching process, especially when the teachers need to propel students to heights that they themselves have never reached.

Tarantino, Scorsese, Kuebrick and many others all share distinct characteristics that make there films recognizable to those serious about cinema. The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?\n\nSummary\n\nBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name "Baby" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is. \n\nReview\n\nPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level.

Tarantino, Scorsese, Kuebrick and many others all share distinct characteristics that make there films recognizable to those serious about cinema. The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?\n\nSummary\n\nBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name "Baby" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is. \n\nReview\n\nPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level. We then proceed to a long tracking shot of Baby navigating to a coffee shop, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful shots of 2017. I never thought Watching someone get coffee would be this entertaining. Wright does a good job from the start of putting us into this kids world while simultaneously showing us why he doesn't belong in it. The casting choices were all good and added different elements to the story. Baby was the only one tied to music physically through his iPod, but each character was choreographed as if they were listening too. The action was shot really well especially the getaway scenes, both on foot and in the car. The car chase scenes are pure brilliance making The Fast and The Furious movies look 2nd tier. Edgar truly kept me engaged and I never felt cheated in any scene. \n\nCons\n\nMuch of the film focused on visuals to the point where I felt some characters were a tad bit flat. Subtracting Baby and Doc (Kevin Spacy), I felt the others could have had a little more substance. Some of their decisions and actions felt somewhat robotic in my opinion. With that being said Buddy (Hamm) and Batts (Foxx) did shine in a couple of scenes due to them being quality actors.

It's an intro will never forget for not only its ability to get stuck in my head, but also for the show it represents. The Smurfs' legacy has extended over the decades into a plethora of forms primarily in the TV shows and movies of the 80s. After a six-year hiatus from the live action movies, the blue creatures return to the silver screen to try to regain footing. Will the new style work, or does it fall much like the character Clumsy Smurf? Robbie K here with a review on the Smurfs: The Lost Village. Let's get started. \n\nLIKES:  Animation style works  Feels like a Smurfs Adventure  Surprisingly emotions  Soundtrack\n\nSummary: When I saw the trailers for this film, I had my doubts after seeing the definition the live action movies did. Fortunately, the animation works and feels more Smurf like than the previous movies. Our cast of blue minis has fluid movement and style that is representative of the classic series, as the colorful world and all its creatures pop in the same happy, righteous style they capture all those years ago. However, the animation is not the only thing that represents the classic style. The adventure of Lost Village is representative of the classic Smurfs cartoon, filled with epic silliness and kid friendly action for all to enjoy. Much of the audience targeted by this film, will enjoy all the quirky jokes and simplistic scenes, sure to feel their hearts fill with joy at all the happiness packed in this movie. This movie isn't all sunshine and rainbows though, as the film has a little more emotional punch than I expected, with a few sequences well-crafted to derail the ecstasy this movie elates. And if all that isn't enough to convince you the movie is fun, then the soundtrack will certainly bring this point home. You will certainly find the musical numbers full of energy and may find yourself dancing in your seat  like me. Not the most unique, but the tracks picked for this film are quite perfect for the scene and would be one CD to pick up. \n\nDISLIKES  Rushed at times  Lost Potential  Anticlimactic Ending  Gargamel not as funny\n\nSummary: Smurfs adventures have never been long, but when in cartoon series form you had plenty of episodes to tell a complete story. Not the case for this film. Sure, they wrap up a lot of the ties, but many times the film seems rushed, leaving things underdeveloped in an attempt to cram everything into the short run time. While I give the editing props, I also sigh at the lost potential of this movie. Lost Village does a nice job showing off the Forbidden Forest and giving us some unique flora and fauna to the world. Yet, the trek could have had a few more obstacles for the heroes to challenge before getting to their goal. Not that big a deal, okay how about the fact that some of your favorite Smurfs have been tossed to the secondary bin including Papa Smurf the legendary leader. If that still isn't enough, then how about the fact the new tribes of Smurf girls are very underdeveloped. After a cool introduction and sweet styled montage, the girl Smurfs are almost as useless as Gargamel's jokes. No cool moves, no special magic, and almost very little importance to the plot, the girl Smurfs tribe really could have been taken further to make it worth all the casting they did for voices and the money they spent. And because of their minor involvement, and a predictable story line, the exciting climax at the end  was so climactic as it was an animated light show. Had I not had to struggle through the forced comedy of Gargamel, that often devolved into mindless, one directional banter, that few above the age of seven will enjoy. Really missed Hank Azaria's delivery and writing on this one. \n\nThe Verdict: \n\nThe Smurfs Lost Village is a nice reintroduction of the gang back into the modern world with the feel, design, and energy the show always had. However, the lost potential, rushed development, and anticlimactic moments certainly took away from all the potential the movie could have brought. Perhaps instead of a movie, the Smurfs should have been picked up by Netflix and the show restarted for the new generation of streamers. Needless to say, this movie isn't so much theater worthy (outside of music and animation) and would recommend waiting for this one to hit home. \n\nMy scores are: \n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And because of their minor involvement, and a predictable story line, the exciting climax at the end  was so climactic as it was an animated light show. Had I not had to struggle through the forced comedy of Gargamel, that often devolved into mindless, one directional banter, that few above the age of seven will enjoy. Really missed Hank Azaria's delivery and writing on this one. \n\nThe Verdict: \n\nThe Smurfs Lost Village is a nice reintroduction of the gang back into the modern world with the feel, design, and energy the show always had. However, the lost potential, rushed development, and anticlimactic moments certainly took away from all the potential the movie could have brought. Perhaps instead of a movie, the Smurfs should have been picked up by Netflix and the show restarted for the new generation of streamers. Needless to say, this movie isn't so much theater worthy (outside of music and animation) and would recommend waiting for this one to hit home. \n\nMy scores are: \n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It's very much grounded in the present (the present being 2016) and our reality, which I'm personally grateful for. There aren't any mustache twirling villains, mad scientists or shady billionaires (as of yet) - the characters are youthful and relatable, played by a very promising ensemble of Canadian actors. The premise is refreshingly original, utilizing the idea of souls hosting human vessels rather than the physical act of time-traveling (there's no cheesy time machines here). Grant MacLaren (played by Eric McCormack) rounds out the group as a much-needed older authoritative figure. Having seen McCormack's previous acting work I have no doubt he'll serve as a backbone for this show. "Travelers" has great potential and I look forward to seeing what it has to offer.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48128,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I really liked the first episode. Raylen Givins is a complete bad a**! It is well written and had several great lines that made me pause and rewind. The secondary characters were also interesting. I especially liked Raylen childhood friend turned Neo-Nazi, Boyd. I hope that each episode uncovers more about Raylen and what makes him tick. Give Justified a watch and you won't be disappointed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88955,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

What starts out as a funny and corny "fish out of water" movie, slowly morphs into a more serious film about the addictive nature of constantly being in a warzone situation.\n\nFey is perfectly cast as the central character - war correspondent Kim Baker - who heads to an overseas assignment in Afghanistan to escape a rather humdrum life. I was a little nervous, at first, as all the funny parts that were in the trailer were in the first 1/2 hour of this film - and Fey handles those with aplomb. She is a gifted comedienne, so these scenes looked effortless for her. It is her transition to a more serious reporter, addicted to the adrenaline of her job that Fey really shines. I was impressed with her serious work in THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU and was anxious when it looked like her career regressed with last December's SISTERS, but I'm happy to say she continues to grow as an actress and she is strong in this part.\n\nBut, this movie is more than just Fey. She has a very strong supporting cast around her - Martin Freeman as an Irish photographer, Margot Robbie (who continues to grow as an actress) as a friend/journalist competitor to Fey, Alfred Molina as an Afghanistan politician and newcomer (at least to me) Christoper Abbott as Fey's interpreter - they all bring something interesting to the table that helps this movie along.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of Billy Bob Thornton's General Hollander - the US Commander in the region. While he does not have many scenes in the movie, he brings a presence that is heads and shoulders above everyone else when he is on screen. This fits well in this movie, for the Commanding General in that region should be heads and shoulders above the rest.

What starts out as a funny and corny "fish out of water" movie, slowly morphs into a more serious film about the addictive nature of constantly being in a warzone situation.\n\nFey is perfectly cast as the central character - war correspondent Kim Baker - who heads to an overseas assignment in Afghanistan to escape a rather humdrum life. I was a little nervous, at first, as all the funny parts that were in the trailer were in the first 1/2 hour of this film - and Fey handles those with aplomb. She is a gifted comedienne, so these scenes looked effortless for her. It is her transition to a more serious reporter, addicted to the adrenaline of her job that Fey really shines. I was impressed with her serious work in THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU and was anxious when it looked like her career regressed with last December's SISTERS, but I'm happy to say she continues to grow as an actress and she is strong in this part.\n\nBut, this movie is more than just Fey. She has a very strong supporting cast around her - Martin Freeman as an Irish photographer, Margot Robbie (who continues to grow as an actress) as a friend/journalist competitor to Fey, Alfred Molina as an Afghanistan politician and newcomer (at least to me) Christoper Abbott as Fey's interpreter - they all bring something interesting to the table that helps this movie along.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of Billy Bob Thornton's General Hollander - the US Commander in the region. While he does not have many scenes in the movie, he brings a presence that is heads and shoulders above everyone else when he is on screen. This fits well in this movie, for the Commanding General in that region should be heads and shoulders above the rest. He also gave me the best laugh in this movie (a joke I will not spoil here).\n\nThis movie is much, much more than a simple rom-com or military comedy, it is a Comedy/Drama that brings quite a bit of heart to it. I would strongly encourage you to seek this one out, you'll be glad you did.\n\n8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to Bank (of Marquis)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="
