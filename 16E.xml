Robin takes refuge in the nearby Sherwood Forest, where he gathers a band of woodland outlaws who are always stealing money and treasure taken by the Sherrif and giving it back to the poor. His dashing antics impress Maid Marian (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio), a childhood friend, and he quickly becomes popular with the poor and honest folk who nickname him Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves.\n\n The film is very old-fashioned, but it occasionally gives away its 1991 release status with modern touches (the fancy camera-work in which the camera is seemingly fixed upon an arrow as it is fired at a target; the introduction of a Moorish warrior character [Morgan Freeman] to broaden the film's cultural reference; Rickman's self-deprecating pantomimic turn as the wicked Sherrif). On the whole, it is an entertaining film with a good balance between the action and the romance. The best performance - surprisingly - comes from Michael Wincott who oozes menace as the Sherrif's despicable cousin Guy of Gisbourne. There are some quite significant factual errors, the best (by "best" I mean "funniest") of which is when Robin and his Moorish companion stand at the foot of the white cliffs of Dover and Robin tells him: "by nightfall we will dine with my father!"

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence, Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator, while Verger places a $3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.\n\nThe sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But the story just kept getting in the way.\n\nThat's why "When Nature Calls", in my opinion, is much funnier.\n\nThe story of securing a sacred bat is neither too intrusive nor annoying and leaves room for gags aplenty.  \n\nAnd Carrey....

There's Abbot &amp; Costello: a simple-minded clown (Costello) and his more-intelligent, straitlaced keeper (Abbott). Then there's Martin &amp; Lewis: another simple-minded clown (Lewis) and his more intelligent, suave keeper (Martin). Laurel &amp; Hardy: same formula. Mork &amp; Mindy, Laverne &amp; Shirley, Ren &amp; Stimpy, the list goes on. This successful pattern, with minor variations, repeats itself through the years. The clown is always kept in line by his/her more intelligent &amp; responsible keeper.\n\nHere we have a switcheroo. With Black &amp; Cera, the idiot (Jack Black) is in charge, while the smart one (Cera) is taking orders. The dynamic, especially with the extreme opposite personalities of Black &amp; Cera (outgoing vs. introverted), is a riot. Both are equally hilarious, and when they play off each other, it can be downright asphyxiating. I can't believe that this is the only film that features the two of them together like this, but that alone makes "Year One" worth running out to see.\n\nApparently critics haven't been kind to this movie. I've read the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and almost all of the negatives harp on how this doesn't stand up to writer/director Harold Ramis's past hits like Caddyshack, Vacation, Ghostbusters, etc. So what? Beethoven's 9th symphony may not have been as powerful as his 5th but we still like it.\n\n"Year One" delivers some great laughs, period. Beginning in what seems to be caveman times but quickly shifting into Old Testament Biblical times, it takes us on a wild romp through episodes of Cain &amp; Abel, Abraham &amp; Isaac, Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, and a particularly boy-hungry high priest played by Oliver Platt (you will NEVER recognize him). Irreverent, yes. Funny, yes. Offensive, I doubt it. Not any more than "History of the World Part 1" or "Monty Python's Holy Grail". Definitely less biting than "Life of Brian". But it does pack some bite.\n\nThe story isn't particularly new, but it serves its purpose to serve as a vehicle for some witty gags. And again I must harp on the Black-Cera delivery that makes it work. Jack Black plays an inept, loud-mouthed hunter who is constantly coming up with stupid ideas that get them in big trouble. Cera plays a meek gatherer who follows along with everything, quietly trying to explain the idiocy of it all while being ignored. The comedy flows so naturally you'd think it was all improvised like in a Christopher Guest film. But I read in an interview that there wasn't much improv at all. Just a carefully planned script and excellent delivery.\n\nThe comedy is mostly family-friendly, but there are some adult innuendos and suggestive gags that may cross the line on occasion. If you &amp; your family feel comfortable laughing about circumcisions, then hey no problem.\n\nAlthough similar in theme, I would never compare "Year One" to "History of the World" or "Holy Grail". Instead, the comedy reminds me more of "The Rocker" (with Rainn Wilson playing a washed-up 80s metal drummer trying to survive in a band today) or maybe even "Men in Black", odd as that may seem.\n\nThere are rumors that Black &amp; Cera may have parts in Ramis's upcoming "Ghostbusters III", and if so I'll definitely run out and see it.

Even though I have liked all four of its principal actors for years, I hadn't planned on seeing it last night or possibly ever. The reviews have been uniformly terrible, so I was expecting the worst. I sat in a movie theater that was perhaps one-third full, and I was waiting for the boredom to set in, which the critics said was comingin spades.\n\nYes, Owen Wilson has bleached-blond locks, again, but that is probably the only accurate comment in any of the reviews that I saw, and I must have read at least ten of them, from various parts of the country. He was very good, as he was in the "Wedding Crashers." Kate Hudson was perky as always, and did a splendid job; and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie's "clone" just as lovely as ever.\n\nMatt Dillon did a terrific job, and was totally believable comically; and Michael Douglas was very good too, playing his character with aplomb. In short, it was a very funny movie, and quite refreshing given the alternatives; namely, movies that are loaded to the gills with special effects, which jar one's cranium to the uttermost.\n\nIt seems like the critics were in lock step in panning this film, which may be driving away audiences unfairly. Indeed, this may be a perfect example of the critics being wrong, dead wrong. Go see it in a theater, or buy a DVD when it comes out, and my guess is that you will not be disappointed one iotaand may actually love it. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced, and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80446,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-11-08","keywords":"reference to audrey hepburn,reference to lance armstrong,cycling accident,road cycling,newlywed couple","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You, Me and Dupree","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2214527257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Universal Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751577/","name":"Anthony Russo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751648/","name":"Joe Russo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239930/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1942829/","name":"Michael LeSieur"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though I have liked all four of its principal actors for years, I hadn't planned on seeing it last night or possibly ever. The reviews have been uniformly terrible, so I was expecting the worst. I sat in a movie theater that was perhaps one-third full, and I was waiting for the boredom to set in, which the critics said was comingin spades.\n\nYes, Owen Wilson has bleached-blond locks, again, but that is probably the only accurate comment in any of the reviews that I saw, and I must have read at least ten of them, from various parts of the country. He was very good, as he was in the "Wedding Crashers." Kate Hudson was perky as always, and did a splendid job; and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie's "clone" just as lovely as ever.\n\nMatt Dillon did a terrific job, and was totally believable comically; and Michael Douglas was very good too, playing his character with aplomb. In short, it was a very funny movie, and quite refreshing given the alternatives; namely, movies that are loaded to the gills with special effects, which jar one's cranium to the uttermost.\n\nIt seems like the critics were in lock step in panning this film, which may be driving away audiences unfairly. Indeed, this may be a perfect example of the critics being wrong, dead wrong. Go see it in a theater, or buy a DVD when it comes out, and my guess is that you will not be disappointed one iotaand may actually love it. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced, and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80446,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-11-08","keywords":"reference to audrey hepburn,reference to lance armstrong,cycling accident,road cycling,newlywed couple","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You, Me and Dupree","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2214527257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Universal Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751577/","name":"Anthony Russo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751648/","name":"Joe Russo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239930/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1942829/","name":"Michael LeSieur"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Resident Evil Damnation was a spectacular breakthrough, more interesting and better than RE: Degeneration. The Effect and CG was great to me, it showed the monsters extremely vividly, beautiful slow-motions. You must keep your eyes open all almost 2hrs because of the very-fast rhythm and nice action of Leon and Ada. The noteworthy thing is about the Lickers- fast,many and even they were the good assistants (know while watching!!!???). Dramatic has been pushed up to the climax when Leon and Buddy against 2 giant Tyrans. And that was the 2nd anniversary of Leon when he was getting on the brink of death to save someone (1st in RE Degeneration)!!! Will you have a good day off?

Resident Evil Damnation was a spectacular breakthrough, more interesting and better than RE: Degeneration. The Effect and CG was great to me, it showed the monsters extremely vividly, beautiful slow-motions. You must keep your eyes open all almost 2hrs because of the very-fast rhythm and nice action of Leon and Ada. The noteworthy thing is about the Lickers- fast,many and even they were the good assistants (know while watching!!!???). Dramatic has been pushed up to the climax when Leon and Buddy against 2 giant Tyrans. And that was the 2nd anniversary of Leon when he was getting on the brink of death to save someone (1st in RE Degeneration)!!! Will you have a good day off? So let's buy the DVD or Bluray from 25 Sep. and enjoy it, maybe you'll agree with my reviews.

If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a "mask" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted.

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gargamel abducted Smurfette because he wants to her to tell him the secret spell with which he can transform his newest creations "The Naughties" into real Smurfs. The Smurfs will team up with their human friends in order to rescue Smurfette before it will be too late.\n\nSince I had already watched the first movie I was expecting from the second to be better something that I thought it wouldn't be so difficult since the first was very bad. Unfortunately for one more time, I was disappointed because believe it or not this movie is even worse than the first one. I didn't like the whole concept of the movie, it was boring and with not any funny moments. The only thing that I liked it was the interpretations of Neil Patrick Harris who played as Patrick Winslow and Brendan Gleeson who played as Victor but in my opinion weren't enough to make this movie more interesting or watchable. Regarding the direction which was made once more by Raja Gosnell was average and worse than the first.\n\nTo sum up, "The Smurfs 2" is a poor movie with not many good or funny scenes, average direction and in comparison with the first movie I have to say that this was even worse. I don't recommend anyone to watch this movie because I believe that you are going to waste your time and I am sure that you won't like it at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40634,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"based on cartoon,sequel,female stockinged legs,new york city,3 dimensional","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2897651993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Smurfs team up with their human friends to rescue Smurfette, who has been kidnapped by Gargamel since she knows a secret spell that can turn the evil sorcerer's newest creation - creatures called the Naughties - into real Smurfs."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000439/","name":"Neil Patrick Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1724323/","name":"Jayma Mays"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2953537/","name":"Katy Perry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331532/","name":"Raja Gosnell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316575/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

Gargamel abducted Smurfette because he wants to her to tell him the secret spell with which he can transform his newest creations "The Naughties" into real Smurfs. The Smurfs will team up with their human friends in order to rescue Smurfette before it will be too late.\n\nSince I had already watched the first movie I was expecting from the second to be better something that I thought it wouldn't be so difficult since the first was very bad. Unfortunately for one more time, I was disappointed because believe it or not this movie is even worse than the first one. I didn't like the whole concept of the movie, it was boring and with not any funny moments. The only thing that I liked it was the interpretations of Neil Patrick Harris who played as Patrick Winslow and Brendan Gleeson who played as Victor but in my opinion weren't enough to make this movie more interesting or watchable. Regarding the direction which was made once more by Raja Gosnell was average and worse than the first.\n\nTo sum up, "The Smurfs 2" is a poor movie with not many good or funny scenes, average direction and in comparison with the first movie I have to say that this was even worse. I don't recommend anyone to watch this movie because I believe that you are going to waste your time and I am sure that you won't like it at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40634,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"based on cartoon,sequel,female stockinged legs,new york city,3 dimensional","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2897651993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Smurfs team up with their human friends to rescue Smurfette, who has been kidnapped by Gargamel since she knows a secret spell that can turn the evil sorcerer's newest creation - creatures called the Naughties - into real Smurfs.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000439/","name":"Neil Patrick Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1724323/","name":"Jayma Mays","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2953537/","name":"Katy Perry"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331532/","name":"Raja Gosnell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316575/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

WRONG! the disastrous Live-Action Smurfs film that had high celebrity voices, Irrelevany Product Placement, and cameos that didn't help the story at all. the film and fell flat with barely making back its budget that left adults childhoods ruined. Later in 2013 was the just as bad sequel to The Smurfs that failed more than the first with the same premise of cameos, unnecessary characters and product placement, and was downright awful spawning the films to roll in peyo's grave. Later in 2017 is a fresh breath of air from the terrible Smurfs movies that Sony made, despite this new being made by Sony. Smurfs The Lost Village is Directed by Kelly Asbury, the same director behind Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, Gnomeo and Juliet, and Spirit. The Movie's plot has best friends Smurfette (Demi Lovato), Brainy (Danny Pudi), Clumsy (Jack McBrayer) and Hefty (Joe Manganiello) use a map that guides them through the Forbidden Forest and wonderland that's filled with magical creatures. Their adventure leads them on a course to discover the biggest secret in Smurf history as they race against time and the evil wizard Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) to find a mysterious village. The plot is your basic Lord of the Rings like quest where the characters are forced to handle environments and new creature that would either friend or eat them. It is a reused basic scheme that Hollywood uses, but it's the execution to the specific details of what matters. The Characters are mostly reminiscent to the creator, Peyo's vision, and maybe some changes that either compel or drag the story either feeling annoying or acceptable. I feel that most of the background Smurfs would have been more reliable and interesting rather than the main smurfs. While the acting is great with the voices not being original and rather that happy-go-lucky charm you either find endearing or redundant. The animation I will say is great though, and seeing the smurfs having more of a look to the comics did feel charming with how the other two, felt...creepy. This movie has it's feel of the Trolls film from 2016 in which they kinda stole their expedition with revealing them in a musical standard. Despite the similar impact, the movie does feel better with the movie barely spewing pop culture references and worthless innuendos. Overall, The Smurfs lost village is good movie despite the childlike humor in most scenes while giving a more character impact whether if you found the useful or useless to the plot. The Plot is executed well in which i give credit for being better than the CGI smurfs movies. This movie can be better for some demographics specifically for younger audiences while boring adults or older teens. The movie is what i call enjoyable for a Point of View whether if you are a child with a pov for thrill seeing characters going on an adventure facing many adversity and discovering a new life. You can pay respect respect for this film considering it has a lower budget than the other terrible Smurfs movies of 60 million with the others being over 100 million, that is bull. I thought the movie was good despite some concerns in the characters not being that reminiscent from Peyo's original vision. If your child or little brother wants a smile on his face, let him watch this movie, and it is a better excuse to just enjoy it better than the previous trash films.

It's interesting to see actors give a shot at directing, writing or even both and for a first feature, Hill doesn't disappoint.\n\nMid90s follows Stevie, a young kid with a troubled family life, and finds a group of friends at a skate shop during the... mid 90s obviously.\n\nIf there is one thing that's executed extremely well, then it's the authentic feeling of the 90s when you watch it. The film has 4:3 aspect ratio and revolves around skateboarding, teenagers, drugs and many more aspects which attribute to the 90s feeling. This film is clearly very personal to Jonah Hill because of how realistic it looks. I really liked the music choices since it amplified the 90s atmosphere even more. It's blatantly targeted towards people from that time period and I'm sure that group of people will find this movie extremely nostalgic. Hill's script is very enjoyable and quite humourous at times. The characters were really fun to watch and what made them believable were the performances by the actors.\n\nSunny Suljic did an incredible job especially as a child performer. He had a lot of range in his acting and played the role to the best of his ability. Na-kel Smith, Olan Prenatt, Gio Galicia and Ryder McLaughlin all gave terrific performances especially considering that fact that all of them haven't acted much before this. Even Lucas Hedges did well as I thought he suited the role.\n\nWhilst watching the movie, it reminded me a lot of Larry Clark's KIDS and I'm sure that film was a huge inspiration to Jonah Hill but it kind of made Mid90s lose some of its originality. Also towards the end, the editing became messy. There was a scene that included somewhat of a jumpscare that I didn't like at all.\n\nMid90s is nowhere near flawless but I respect the amount of work Jonah Hill put into his directorial debut. It's a fun, nostalgic and personal trip coming from someone who's lived through that time and wants to share his love for that period to everyone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-26","keywords":"coming of age,skateboard,friendship,alcohol,party","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602299417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYwMDZkOGQtOWE3Zi00NDE4LTkzOWItNWE1M2E4YWQwMzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWJhbGl2ZQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYwMDZkOGQtOWE3Zi00NDE4LTkzOWItNWE1M2E4YWQwMzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWJhbGl2ZQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Stevie, a thirteen-year-old in 90s-era LA, spends his summer navigating between his troubled home life and a group of new friends that he meets at a Motor Avenue skate shop."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6129779/","name":"Sunny Suljic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2348627/","name":"Lucas Hedges"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093463/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0353060/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) also stars and sends Marshall into a male power trip when she is offered a job position that he was trying so hard to get. Marshall is known for his ability to seduce women and fornicate with them. Most of the women in his life think that he is a self centered jerk, because of the way he objectifies them. Even his fifteen year old daughter feels as if they are not related because of his poor communication skills with women. But an unexpected twist took place one day while blow drying mousse in his hair. While he was going about his business, Marshall tripped, and fell into his bathtub full of water, being electrocuted severely. Oddly enough, what would kill a normal human being did not harm Nick in any way, rather than it mysteriously gave him the power to hear what women are thinking. So, equipped with his new skill, he goes about his day, not knowing he has this amazing ability. Throughout his random encounters with women, particularly at work, he comes to realize that all the women are not very fond of him.\n\nIn all movies, there is always a message of some sort that the director is trying to express. In this particular film, I believe there is more than one message. One of the dilemmas the movie expressed was women do not know what they want. Throughout the movie, women were constantly complaining about men, or their hair, or their outfit. The truth is that women do not know what they do want; only what they don't want. Another message it displayed is a world renown problem: the concept that men do not have a clue about women. They communicate differently as men, and want different things as well. Is reading women's minds the only way for men to understand? I sure hope not.\n\nThe technique of this movie is nothing to throw a fit over. The average cinematography isn't dazzling, but it is good enough to keep the viewer interested. The sound track was well thought out, with many famous songs helping out in several scenes and strongly assisting in setting the mood. A few things stand out in the movie that question reality. For example, Gibson falls into a full bathtub, gets electrocuted by thousands of volts, and only wakes up with a headache. At a different point in the movie he gets shocked again, but not by a household utensil. The second time it's by lightning, and again, just a headache. No singed eyebrows or fried shoelaces were to be found.\n\nWhat Women Want is an entertaining movie at the least. Mel Gibson, as always, does an excellent job portraying his character, as well as Helen Hunt. The cast did a well-rounded job, and no one was out of place. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and enjoyed the humor. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense. It would be a good recommendation for anyone who is bored and desires a humorous, fun movie. The idea of a man being able to read women's minds is clever and amusing.

It's the wrong genre, (although this movie is difficult to place) the wrong story and it creates the wrong type of atmosphere. Leave this to the women and go and see something a little more.......you. How wrong I was and how glad I am to have jumped out of my comfort zone. It was a good excuse to take my good old mum and treat her to a midday-midweek viewing and some company with her first born or that is what I told myself when I entered the theatre only to find it filled with women and retirees excited to be out and about without the frightening hording masses that congregate on weekends.\n\n'The Dressmaker' has been dubbed as the long awaited return of Director Jocelyn Moorhouse to the chair since 1997 and she has delivered a film that will be remembered for some outstanding performances from Judy Davis, Hugo Weaving and Kate Winslet. I agree with the statement that this film doesn't fit into any particular mold but this peculiar inconsistency is what keeps the audience fixated on the screen. Just when you think that the story is heading down a certain path it quickly turns sideways, takes a detour before arriving at its intended destination. Some viewers may find this lack of direction annoying and even film destroying but I think this could be a little over dramatic.\n\n'The Dressmaker' holds a certain charm that never leaves it as it sways back and forth from one type of genre to the next. It can be billed as a 'black comedy' but it does allow the audience to experience an array of emotions. At times you will be laughing at the antics on screen and at other times you will be gripped by the drama unfolding.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by Rosalie Ham, 'The Dressmaker' centres around Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) and her chaotic return to a small Australian country town in rural Victoria in 1951. Tilly's tumultuous departure years before were under controversial circumstances and the small rural community have not forgotten. She is everything the town isn't - sophisticated, stylish, experienced and worldly and she has come back for one reason......to reek havoc on those that callously betrayed her all those years ago.\n\nKate Winslet rarely puts in a bad showing and her turn as Tilly Dunnage is made even more exceptional with a flawless Australian accent. The audience will forget that she is English as she seamlessly slides into the fabric of her surroundings, not once slipping up when delivering her dialogue. Judy Davis is the star of the show as Tilly's mad mother, Molly Dunnage. Davis effortlessly steals every scene she is in with outstanding engagement with a character that is a little bit off centre. Judy will be recognised for this performance with an AACTA and it will be thoroughly deserved.\n\nHugo Weaving adds his superb presence as the cross dressing cop, Sergeant Farrat. His character grows on the audience with eccentric colourful manner, bringing the best out in Weaving that gives this wonderful film an extra element of charm. Liam Hemsworth provides the eye candy for the ladies in a solid role as Teddy McSwiney. Both Davis and Winslet are caught hot under the collar on numerous occasions. He is the stereo-typical tall, blue-eyed, rugged country boy who is the proverbial apple in his mother's eye and does exactly what Moorhouse hired him to do......stand there and look pretty. Good onya Liam.\n\nJoining the familiar talent is a who's who of Australian television that many international audiences won't recognise but they do give the film a more authentic Aussie flavour. Could this be the breakout role for Sarah Snook? Her character Gertrude Pratt is totally transformed by Tilly Dunnage only to treat the outsider with disdain when 'theories' are whispered throughout the town.\n\nI cannot see any reason why this film won't be enjoyed by the masses. It is Australian and its dry wit may not appeal to foreign markets which is a shame. The narrative is all over the place but don't let this put you off. Dig a little deeper and you will be rewarded with some brilliant performances.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58494,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-29","keywords":"f rated,australia,costume designer,haute couture,femme fatale","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Dressmaker trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284565273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjU0NTAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NjU3NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjU0NTAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NjU3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Dressmaker trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001114/","name":"Judy Davis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2955013/","name":"Liam Hemsworth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602104/","name":"Jocelyn Moorhouse"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0481969/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0263798/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5672426/","name":"Rosalie Ham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602104/","name":"Jocelyn Moorhouse"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0389591/","name":"P.J.

Using the catharsis of music to help them cope with the absence of their partners, they found the very first military wives choir. Managed by Kate (Thomas) and Lisa (Horgan), two women who possess extremely conflicting personalities and objectives, the choir steadily acquires widespread media attention that will result in the formation of an influential movement. Cattaneo's film focuses on the kinship shared between these women, each of whom have their own burdens to bear in the face of such uncertain adversity. Much of the films strength comes from the sincerity of the performances, particularly leads Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan, who clash repeatedly throughout the film.

Using the catharsis of music to help them cope with the absence of their partners, they found the very first military wives choir. Managed by Kate (Thomas) and Lisa (Horgan), two women who possess extremely conflicting personalities and objectives, the choir steadily acquires widespread media attention that will result in the formation of an influential movement. Cattaneo's film focuses on the kinship shared between these women, each of whom have their own burdens to bear in the face of such uncertain adversity. Much of the films strength comes from the sincerity of the performances, particularly leads Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan, who clash repeatedly throughout the film. Tunnard and Flynn's screenplay strikes a perfect balance in tone, too. It accomplishes a combination of both humour and tragedy (which is perhaps one of the most difficult dichotomies to nail in screenwriting) in a way that never feels superficial, and although it is clear to see the echoes of where it is all going to go, it's difficult not to become invested in the journey.

But other than that it was a really enjoyable watch and for someone who wasn't really familiar with the true story I found it educational also, which is a nice bonus.\n\nBut yeah, it's definitely a film I'd recommend. 8/10 from me!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":729535,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-07","keywords":"cryptography,world war two,enigma code,mathematician,closeted gay man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3398414105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing, the film portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0328828/","name":"Matthew Goode"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878763/","name":"Morten Tyldum"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0457197/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2441699/","name":"Graham Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388132/","name":"Andrew Hodges"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the wrong genre, (although this movie is difficult to place) the wrong story and it creates the wrong type of atmosphere. Leave this to the women and go and see something a little more.......you. How wrong I was and how glad I am to have jumped out of my comfort zone. It was a good excuse to take my good old mum and treat her to a midday-midweek viewing and some company with her first born or that is what I told myself when I entered the theatre only to find it filled with women and retirees excited to be out and about without the frightening hording masses that congregate on weekends.\n\n'The Dressmaker' has been dubbed as the long awaited return of Director Jocelyn Moorhouse to the chair since 1997 and she has delivered a film that will be remembered for some outstanding performances from Judy Davis, Hugo Weaving and Kate Winslet. I agree with the statement that this film doesn't fit into any particular mold but this peculiar inconsistency is what keeps the audience fixated on the screen. Just when you think that the story is heading down a certain path it quickly turns sideways, takes a detour before arriving at its intended destination. Some viewers may find this lack of direction annoying and even film destroying but I think this could be a little over dramatic.\n\n'The Dressmaker' holds a certain charm that never leaves it as it sways back and forth from one type of genre to the next. It can be billed as a 'black comedy' but it does allow the audience to experience an array of emotions. At times you will be laughing at the antics on screen and at other times you will be gripped by the drama unfolding.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by Rosalie Ham, 'The Dressmaker' centres around Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) and her chaotic return to a small Australian country town in rural Victoria in 1951. Tilly's tumultuous departure years before were under controversial circumstances and the small rural community have not forgotten. She is everything the town isn't - sophisticated, stylish, experienced and worldly and she has come back for one reason......to reek havoc on those that callously betrayed her all those years ago.\n\nKate Winslet rarely puts in a bad showing and her turn as Tilly Dunnage is made even more exceptional with a flawless Australian accent. The audience will forget that she is English as she seamlessly slides into the fabric of her surroundings, not once slipping up when delivering her dialogue. Judy Davis is the star of the show as Tilly's mad mother, Molly Dunnage. Davis effortlessly steals every scene she is in with outstanding engagement with a character that is a little bit off centre. Judy will be recognised for this performance with an AACTA and it will be thoroughly deserved.\n\nHugo Weaving adds his superb presence as the cross dressing cop, Sergeant Farrat. His character grows on the audience with eccentric colourful manner, bringing the best out in Weaving that gives this wonderful film an extra element of charm. Liam Hemsworth provides the eye candy for the ladies in a solid role as Teddy McSwiney. Both Davis and Winslet are caught hot under the collar on numerous occasions. He is the stereo-typical tall, blue-eyed, rugged country boy who is the proverbial apple in his mother's eye and does exactly what Moorhouse hired him to do......stand there and look pretty. Good onya Liam.\n\nJoining the familiar talent is a who's who of Australian television that many international audiences won't recognise but they do give the film a more authentic Aussie flavour. Could this be the breakout role for Sarah Snook? Her character Gertrude Pratt is totally transformed by Tilly Dunnage only to treat the outsider with disdain when 'theories' are whispered throughout the town.\n\nI cannot see any reason why this film won't be enjoyed by the masses. It is Australian and its dry wit may not appeal to foreign markets which is a shame. The narrative is all over the place but don't let this put you off. Dig a little deeper and you will be rewarded with some brilliant performances.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58494,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-29","keywords":"f rated,australia,costume designer,haute couture,femme fatale","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Dressmaker trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284565273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjU0NTAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NjU3NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjU0NTAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NjU3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Dressmaker trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001114/","name":"Judy Davis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2955013/","name":"Liam Hemsworth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602104/","name":"Jocelyn Moorhouse"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0481969/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0263798/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5672426/","name":"Rosalie Ham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602104/","name":"Jocelyn Moorhouse"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0389591/","name":"P.J.

I think it wasn't a complete trainwreck, and the actors did as much as they could with a weak script. The direction and technical aspects were fine for a low-budget comedy.\n\nThe voice of the OS definitely got nerve-gratingly annoying very quickly, which was a big distraction. There was no comedic timing, and it sounded very dated, like the voice of the computer on the original Star Trek series. But, again, this wasn't the worst movie ever made. I got a few very genuine laughs watching this (a very few laughs, but still).

In spite of their language debacle, Dheepan becomes a caretaker of a derelict housing block and he also finds a job for Yalini, as a hourly maid to attend to a senior uncle of the gangster member Brahim (Rottiers), who has just been released from the penitentiary for probation, whereas Illayaal enrols in the local school where she has a tough time to blend in.\n\nParis, even the suburban area, should be a safe haven for the makeshift family taking flight from a war zone, but in Audiard's conception, France is far cry from a paradise for immigrants and refugees, hooliganism and gang war threaten Dheepan and his family's life almost on a daily basis, which is an ever so familiar situation for them, as if the shadows of war have tracked them from their native country to another continent, no exit is on the horizon, everywhere seems to be a dead-end, life is almost the same, worthless, in spite of being accommodated in a quite comfy apartment and earning a self-sufficient wages, they can be dispatched by the flying bullets any time on the streets, even under the broad daylight. Sooner or later, the straining mental stress will implode, especially for Yalini, whose working condition becomes increasingly precarious since she deals with gangster members first-hand, a highly-stylish set piece where Dheepan single-handedly takes on the droogs to save Yalini, with unusual subjective camera angle and heightened slo- motion shots aiming persistently to the waist-below, it is Audiard's intemperate stunt to impress after holding it back for a long time, nevertheless it deficiently appeases what viewers anticipate (especially when Dheepan's provocative behaviour of drawing the line between warring gangsters receives no personal danger to him or whatsoever) - to exaggerate Dheephan's "heroic act" as if he is the action hero who is capable to calmly finishing off his enemies one by one with great panache, is too much a stretch, even for someone with his battlefield background, since his life is too insignificant to matter under the radical situations which Audiard insists to lead us on. So is the ambiguous happy ending in England, a dream too perfect to be true which contradicts the harsh realism which Audiard intently fabricates.\n\nWhere all three main actors are non-professionals, it is pleasing to watch a tangible bond has been built between Yalini and Brahim, lost in translation, they don't understand each other's language, but the beguiling charm and draw between total strangers has reached its well-received receptor without put civil decency at its expense. In spite of being an allegorical account of a seemingly ordinary person's unexpected hidden depths, DHEEPHAN arrives topically in the current muddy waters of immigrants and war refugees in Europe, it leaves the impression of a self-justifying excuse to warn those unfortunately masses, but maybe they are not deeming Europe as the promised land, for them, any place other than their levelled home, is an egress from danger and poverty, so, at such desperation, it is well worth it.\n\nOne particularly telling scene of Audiard's poetic creativity is when the location transitions from Sri Lanka to Paris, the blurry fluorescent light slowly reveals itself being generated from a plastic hat which Dheepan wears when he is hawking on the street of Paris with other immigrants, such sleight-of-hand is mesmerising, alas, there is just not enough of them in this Palme d'Or crowner.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-08-26","keywords":"tamil,caretaker,france,sri lankan,janitor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2043853337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316147/","name":"Jesuthasan Antonythasan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316148/","name":"Kalieaswari Srinivasan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316149/","name":"Claudine Vinasithamby"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258767/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081179/","name":"Thomas Bidegain"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380548/","name":"Noé Debré"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In spite of their language debacle, Dheepan becomes a caretaker of a derelict housing block and he also finds a job for Yalini, as a hourly maid to attend to a senior uncle of the gangster member Brahim (Rottiers), who has just been released from the penitentiary for probation, whereas Illayaal enrols in the local school where she has a tough time to blend in.\n\nParis, even the suburban area, should be a safe haven for the makeshift family taking flight from a war zone, but in Audiard's conception, France is far cry from a paradise for immigrants and refugees, hooliganism and gang war threaten Dheepan and his family's life almost on a daily basis, which is an ever so familiar situation for them, as if the shadows of war have tracked them from their native country to another continent, no exit is on the horizon, everywhere seems to be a dead-end, life is almost the same, worthless, in spite of being accommodated in a quite comfy apartment and earning a self-sufficient wages, they can be dispatched by the flying bullets any time on the streets, even under the broad daylight. Sooner or later, the straining mental stress will implode, especially for Yalini, whose working condition becomes increasingly precarious since she deals with gangster members first-hand, a highly-stylish set piece where Dheepan single-handedly takes on the droogs to save Yalini, with unusual subjective camera angle and heightened slo- motion shots aiming persistently to the waist-below, it is Audiard's intemperate stunt to impress after holding it back for a long time, nevertheless it deficiently appeases what viewers anticipate (especially when Dheepan's provocative behaviour of drawing the line between warring gangsters receives no personal danger to him or whatsoever) - to exaggerate Dheephan's "heroic act" as if he is the action hero who is capable to calmly finishing off his enemies one by one with great panache, is too much a stretch, even for someone with his battlefield background, since his life is too insignificant to matter under the radical situations which Audiard insists to lead us on. So is the ambiguous happy ending in England, a dream too perfect to be true which contradicts the harsh realism which Audiard intently fabricates.\n\nWhere all three main actors are non-professionals, it is pleasing to watch a tangible bond has been built between Yalini and Brahim, lost in translation, they don't understand each other's language, but the beguiling charm and draw between total strangers has reached its well-received receptor without put civil decency at its expense. In spite of being an allegorical account of a seemingly ordinary person's unexpected hidden depths, DHEEPHAN arrives topically in the current muddy waters of immigrants and war refugees in Europe, it leaves the impression of a self-justifying excuse to warn those unfortunately masses, but maybe they are not deeming Europe as the promised land, for them, any place other than their levelled home, is an egress from danger and poverty, so, at such desperation, it is well worth it.\n\nOne particularly telling scene of Audiard's poetic creativity is when the location transitions from Sri Lanka to Paris, the blurry fluorescent light slowly reveals itself being generated from a plastic hat which Dheepan wears when he is hawking on the street of Paris with other immigrants, such sleight-of-hand is mesmerising, alas, there is just not enough of them in this Palme d'Or crowner.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-08-26","keywords":"tamil,caretaker,france,sri lankan,janitor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2043853337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316147/","name":"Jesuthasan Antonythasan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316148/","name":"Kalieaswari Srinivasan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316149/","name":"Claudine Vinasithamby"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258767/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081179/","name":"Thomas Bidegain","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380548/","name":"Noé Debré"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is actually a problem all the way through, as it never slows down enough for us to truly take in the isolation and loneliness that Donald Crowhurst (Colin Firth, that is) must have felt in real life. We spend too much time on land and too little time at sea. As with many other films, it's hard to translate human thoughts onto the big screen ("The Old Man and the Sea" must be the classic example of this), and "The Mercy" fails on this note more often than it succeeds.\n\nI do, however, still recommend the film, because it is still a good movie with good actors, and it's worth watching. It's just a shame that it doesn't reach its full potential, with a fascinating story such as this one.\n\nI haven't seen "Crowhurst" (produced at the same time as "The Mercy", but by a different studio), but I've heard that that one is a bit better. In the end, "Deep Water" seems to be the best choice, however.\n\nUPDATE (8 November, 2018): I have now seen "Crowhurst", and I am not sure if it's better than "The Mercy". I gave both films six stars. They are very different, however, as "Crowhurst" is more of a low-budget, theatrical art house film. It is also a character study, rather than a story-driven movie.

Well, with this movie, almost everything did. It's slow, boring, repetitive and overall just disappointing.\n\nAdam (Liam Hensworth) is a programmer (I think, because character development apparently wasn't a priority in this movie) who gets stuck in the middle of a feud between two tech giants, Wyatt and Goddard, played by Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford. And that's about as deep as the story goes. There's some background as to the rivalry between Wyatt and Goddard and a hard-to-believe love story between Adam and one of Goddard's executives, but overall, the film feels like an unfinished job, with a lot of potential, but no real charm to it.\n\nI've got to accept the movie has some good things worth mentioning. Gary Oldman is great, as expected, in his limited screen time, and the final scenes are actually pretty good, but all in all this was not a good movie, and I would not recommend it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36441,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-08-16","keywords":"spying,thumbprint,traffic,man wears a swimsuit,man wrapped in a towel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3075778073","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The two most powerful tech billionaires in the world are bitter rivals with a complicated past.

Well, with this movie, almost everything did. It's slow, boring, repetitive and overall just disappointing.\n\nAdam (Liam Hensworth) is a programmer (I think, because character development apparently wasn't a priority in this movie) who gets stuck in the middle of a feud between two tech giants, Wyatt and Goddard, played by Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford. And that's about as deep as the story goes. There's some background as to the rivalry between Wyatt and Goddard and a hard-to-believe love story between Adam and one of Goddard's executives, but overall, the film feels like an unfinished job, with a lot of potential, but no real charm to it.\n\nI've got to accept the movie has some good things worth mentioning. Gary Oldman is great, as expected, in his limited screen time, and the final scenes are actually pretty good, but all in all this was not a good movie, and I would not recommend it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36441,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-08-16","keywords":"spying,thumbprint,traffic,man wears a swimsuit,man wrapped in a towel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3075778073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The two most powerful tech billionaires in the world are bitter rivals with a complicated past.

Nakon što se čovječanstvo samo dovelo na rub izumiranja, jedan gorljivi preživjeli usamljenik probija se kanadskim bespućem u potrazi za znanjem i sredstvima s ciljem preoblikovanja čovječanstva. Deset godina poslije žena podiže desetero djece iste dobi te ih priprema na žrtve koje će morati podnijeti kako bi spasili ljudsku vrstu.</desc>

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no "stars" appeared in "Ex Machina" and "Eva", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":511079,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot,robot human relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10.

I appreciated it.\n\nYou should definitely watch this, its really fun, supper quick and well made.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":62933,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-11-20","keywords":"revenge,kidnapping,villainess played by lead actress,mother daughter relationship,child abduction","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1238024473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EwOWRkMjAtNmRiOS00MTY5LTgxZmMtNDc5OGM4MDVhYmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EwOWRkMjAtNmRiOS00MTY5LTgxZmMtNDc5OGM4MDVhYmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A homeschooled teenager begins to suspect her mother is keeping a dark secret from her.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005299/","name":"Sarah Paulson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6266674/","name":"Kiera Allen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3337639/","name":"Sara Sohn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3792134/","name":"Aneesh Chaganty"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3792134/","name":"Aneesh Chaganty","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3539578/","name":"Sev Ohanian"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film was directed by 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormakur and written by William Nicholson (Gladiator, Les Miserables) and Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes and Josh Brolin. To start the film is beautiful; the director of photography Salvatore Totino presented the size and scale of the environment beautifully with multiple aerial shots. Totino has a clear and linear style, which is refreshing after the summer, which with the exception of a couple of films, has been dominated by shaky-cam and extremely quick cuts.\n\nThe dialogue in the film stands out, however the plot does not. The characters were underdeveloped, partially due to the lack of introduction that is given to our main characters; this combined with the slow pace of the first act causes the film to drag. However it should be noted that the film makes a point of showing the process of preparing to climb Everest. The second act is fine, not great though and is intense especially during the storm and finally the film just finishes, which really throws you out of the film. \n\nAlthough none of the performances in the film were award-worthy they still were acceptable and in some cases quite good. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin had the meatiest roles, and they both provided good performances. However out of the two, Jason Clarke provided the best performance. The side characters were forgettable, with the exception of Doug (John Hawkes) and Yasuko (Naoko Mori), with Doug being a postman and Yasuko finally completing the seven summits, two things which helped to distinguish them. Everyone in the film was 'care-beared', thankfully, and they had to be otherwise it would impossible to tell who you were looking at.\n\nOne part of production that deserves praise in this film is the lighting department who did a superb job on presenting a clear environment; especially during the storm. A quick side note- the score of the film was forgettable. \n\nUltimately, Everest is an intense drama thriller that has its problems, however is still beautiful to watch, I wouldn't purchase it on 3D Blu-ray, as after watching it in 3D I didn't find anything spectacular or noteworthy, however I would consider buying it on Blu-ray.

The film was directed by 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormakur and written by William Nicholson (Gladiator, Les Miserables) and Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes and Josh Brolin. To start the film is beautiful; the director of photography Salvatore Totino presented the size and scale of the environment beautifully with multiple aerial shots. Totino has a clear and linear style, which is refreshing after the summer, which with the exception of a couple of films, has been dominated by shaky-cam and extremely quick cuts.\n\nThe dialogue in the film stands out, however the plot does not. The characters were underdeveloped, partially due to the lack of introduction that is given to our main characters; this combined with the slow pace of the first act causes the film to drag. However it should be noted that the film makes a point of showing the process of preparing to climb Everest. The second act is fine, not great though and is intense especially during the storm and finally the film just finishes, which really throws you out of the film. \n\nAlthough none of the performances in the film were award-worthy they still were acceptable and in some cases quite good. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin had the meatiest roles, and they both provided good performances. However out of the two, Jason Clarke provided the best performance. The side characters were forgettable, with the exception of Doug (John Hawkes) and Yasuko (Naoko Mori), with Doug being a postman and Yasuko finally completing the seven summits, two things which helped to distinguish them. Everyone in the film was 'care-beared', thankfully, and they had to be otherwise it would impossible to tell who you were looking at.\n\nOne part of production that deserves praise in this film is the lighting department who did a superb job on presenting a clear environment; especially during the storm. A quick side note- the score of the film was forgettable. \n\nUltimately, Everest is an intense drama thriller that has its problems, however is still beautiful to watch, I wouldn't purchase it on 3D Blu-ray, as after watching it in 3D I didn't find anything spectacular or noteworthy, however I would consider buying it on Blu-ray. Overall, I am going to give Everest a C+ or 6/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":210841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Biography"],"datePublished":"2015-09-16","keywords":"mount everest,mountain climbing,survival,mountain,man versus nature","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946006297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the incredible events surrounding an attempt to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest documents the awe-inspiring journey of two different expeditions challenged beyond their  limits by one of the fiercest snowstorms ever encountered by mankind.

The film was directed by 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormakur and written by William Nicholson (Gladiator, Les Miserables) and Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes and Josh Brolin. To start the film is beautiful; the director of photography Salvatore Totino presented the size and scale of the environment beautifully with multiple aerial shots. Totino has a clear and linear style, which is refreshing after the summer, which with the exception of a couple of films, has been dominated by shaky-cam and extremely quick cuts.\n\nThe dialogue in the film stands out, however the plot does not. The characters were underdeveloped, partially due to the lack of introduction that is given to our main characters; this combined with the slow pace of the first act causes the film to drag. However it should be noted that the film makes a point of showing the process of preparing to climb Everest. The second act is fine, not great though and is intense especially during the storm and finally the film just finishes, which really throws you out of the film. \n\nAlthough none of the performances in the film were award-worthy they still were acceptable and in some cases quite good. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin had the meatiest roles, and they both provided good performances. However out of the two, Jason Clarke provided the best performance. The side characters were forgettable, with the exception of Doug (John Hawkes) and Yasuko (Naoko Mori), with Doug being a postman and Yasuko finally completing the seven summits, two things which helped to distinguish them. Everyone in the film was 'care-beared', thankfully, and they had to be otherwise it would impossible to tell who you were looking at.\n\nOne part of production that deserves praise in this film is the lighting department who did a superb job on presenting a clear environment; especially during the storm. A quick side note- the score of the film was forgettable. \n\nUltimately, Everest is an intense drama thriller that has its problems, however is still beautiful to watch, I wouldn't purchase it on 3D Blu-ray, as after watching it in 3D I didn't find anything spectacular or noteworthy, however I would consider buying it on Blu-ray. Overall, I am going to give Everest a C+ or 6/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":210841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Biography"],"datePublished":"2015-09-16","keywords":"mount everest,mountain climbing,survival,mountain,man versus nature","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946006297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the incredible events surrounding an attempt to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest documents the awe-inspiring journey of two different expeditions challenged beyond their  limits by one of the fiercest snowstorms ever encountered by mankind.

Gustave Flaubert's novel was so rich, undulating that any adaptation in images can only be reducing and simplistic. More than the tragic story of its heroine, Flaubert's novel encompassed a word picture of Normandy (the bulk of the film was shot in the village of Lyons-La-Forêt near Rouen) and a cruel, cynical vision of the world. If the first feature is satisfying on the screen, the second one is hardly perceptible. Hence, this crucial question: is it possible to fully recreate Flaubert's novel? Chabrol's film is faithful to the main plot with the rise and fall of her heroine sometimes told by François Périer's voice-over in spite of accelerated views on certain vital episodes, notably the peasant marriage that disgusted Emma Bovary.

But Chabrol doesn't break new ground with this adaptation that required something else than an elegant directing, a brilliant cast and splendid scenery. That's why his rendering of Flaubert's work is just an honorable reading of the novel in the end. One could also add that Flaubert's book was a solid opportunity for an onslaught at provincial lower middle class. But it's only skimmed over and it's a wasted bonanza.\n\nChabrol's reading of "Madame Bovary" amounts to the same result as Claude Berri's adaptation of Emile Zola's epic novel "Germinal" in 1993: honorable instead of being unforgettable, a commendable action instead of a ground-breaking creation. The author of "le Boucher" (1970) was rather on the wrong track but fortunately, he'll find his way again the following year with another woman depiction: "Betty" (1992).

Georges Simenon's universe suits him much better than Flaubert's one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3885,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1991-04-03","keywords":"character name as title,emma bovary character,period drama,quoting alphonse de lamartine,wedding","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Madame Bovary (1991)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3198616345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY4NDQ3ZjItNDY2OC00NWM5LTg4ZDMtZDczNmIxNWJlZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY4NDQ3ZjItNDY2OC00NWM5LTg4ZDMtZDczNmIxNWJlZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Samuel Goldwyn","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0050983/","name":"Jean-François Balmer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0539022/","name":"Christophe Malavoy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055736/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0254873/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281306/","name":"Gustave Flaubert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"],"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Dok rješava zločine, dr. Blake sluša tajne i laži svojih pacijenata i pomaže im da unesu mir i pravdu u svoje živote. Blake je obrazovan, proputovao je svijet i vidio najgore što ljudi mogu učiniti jedni drugima. Nakon studija u Škotskoj, dr. Blake je kao vojni ljekar u britanskoj vojsci služio na Dalekom istoku tokom Drugoga svjetskog rata. Bez znanja porodice oženio se Kineskinjom s kojom je dobio dijete. U doba pada Singapura izgubili su kontakt. Na kraju duge i neuspješne potrage za suprugom i djetetom, dr. Blake se vraća u rodni Ballarat, kako bi preuzeo praksu od svog oca na samrti. Progone ga uspomene na ratne užase, zatočeništvo u zloglasnom logoru u Tajlandu i njegov lični gubitak. U javnosti dr. Blake je moralni kompas zajednice, dok je privatno čovjek koji iz prve ruke zna kako ljudi mogu biti nečovječni prema drugima. Rijetki razumiju njegov vragolasti humor i mogu probiti njegov psihološki oklop. Čak ni njegova odana asistentica Jean ponekad nema strpljenja za Dr. Blakea.</desc>

Worth a look.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-03-12","keywords":"fitness class,instagram,stalker,mother daughter relationship,morning show","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"SWEAT international trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3678780953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU1ZWEyMjQtOTBmNy00YjUyLWI2MTYtYjllODk3ZmNjMDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU1ZWEyMjQtOTBmNy00YjUyLWI2MTYtYjllODk3ZmNjMDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5972800/","name":"Magdalena Kolesnik","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6873940/","name":"Julian Swiezewski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1452458/","name":"Aleksandra Konieczna"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3281319/","name":"Magnus von Horn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0349562/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0338571/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001935/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3281319/","name":"Magnus von Horn"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Dok rješava zločine, dr. Blake sluša tajne i laži svojih pacijenata i pomaže im da unesu mir i pravdu u svoje živote. Blake je obrazovan, proputovao je svijet i vidio najgore što ljudi mogu učiniti jedni drugima. Nakon studija u Škotskoj, dr. Blake je kao vojni ljekar u britanskoj vojsci služio na Dalekom istoku tokom Drugoga svjetskog rata. Bez znanja porodice oženio se Kineskinjom s kojom je dobio dijete. U doba pada Singapura izgubili su kontakt. Na kraju duge i neuspješne potrage za suprugom i djetetom, dr. Blake se vraća u rodni Ballarat, kako bi preuzeo praksu od svog oca na samrti. Progone ga uspomene na ratne užase, zatočeništvo u zloglasnom logoru u Tajlandu i njegov lični gubitak. U javnosti dr. Blake je moralni kompas zajednice, dok je privatno čovjek koji iz prve ruke zna kako ljudi mogu biti nečovječni prema drugima. Rijetki razumiju njegov vragolasti humor i mogu probiti njegov psihološki oklop. Čak ni njegova odana asistentica Jean ponekad nema strpljenja za Dr. Blakea.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Dok rješava zločine, dr. Blake sluša tajne i laži svojih pacijenata i pomaže im da unesu mir i pravdu u svoje živote. Blake je obrazovan, proputovao je svijet i vidio najgore što ljudi mogu učiniti jedni drugima. Nakon studija u Škotskoj, dr. Blake je kao vojni ljekar u britanskoj vojsci služio na Dalekom istoku tokom Drugoga svjetskog rata. Bez znanja porodice oženio se Kineskinjom s kojom je dobio dijete. U doba pada Singapura izgubili su kontakt. Na kraju duge i neuspješne potrage za suprugom i djetetom, dr. Blake se vraća u rodni Ballarat, kako bi preuzeo praksu od svog oca na samrti. Progone ga uspomene na ratne užase, zatočeništvo u zloglasnom logoru u Tajlandu i njegov lični gubitak. U javnosti dr. Blake je moralni kompas zajednice, dok je privatno čovjek koji iz prve ruke zna kako ljudi mogu biti nečovječni prema drugima. Rijetki razumiju njegov vragolasti humor i mogu probiti njegov psihološki oklop. Čak ni njegova odana asistentica Jean ponekad nema strpljenja za Dr. Blakea.</desc>

Policija ima samo zagonetne i zloslutne ključeve o tome što se moglo dogoditi. Prijatelji i obitelj nestale nemaju pojma kamo je mogla otići. Nitko od susjeda nije zapazio ništa neobično.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Dok rješava zločine, dr. Blake sluša tajne i laži svojih pacijenata i pomaže im da unesu mir i pravdu u svoje živote. Blake je obrazovan, proputovao je svijet i vidio najgore što ljudi mogu učiniti jedni drugima. Nakon studija u Škotskoj, dr. Blake je kao vojni ljekar u britanskoj vojsci služio na Dalekom istoku tokom Drugoga svjetskog rata. Bez znanja porodice oženio se Kineskinjom s kojom je dobio dijete. U doba pada Singapura izgubili su kontakt. Na kraju duge i neuspješne potrage za suprugom i djetetom, dr. Blake se vraća u rodni Ballarat, kako bi preuzeo praksu od svog oca na samrti. Progone ga uspomene na ratne užase, zatočeništvo u zloglasnom logoru u Tajlandu i njegov lični gubitak. U javnosti dr. Blake je moralni kompas zajednice, dok je privatno čovjek koji iz prve ruke zna kako ljudi mogu biti nečovječni prema drugima. Rijetki razumiju njegov vragolasti humor i mogu probiti njegov psihološki oklop. Čak ni njegova odana asistentica Jean ponekad nema strpljenja za Dr. Blakea.</desc>

DiCaprio becomes Howard Hughes. The actor is so profoundly absorbed in the role that the DiCaprio we know from other films cannot be found in this film. It is a bravura performance of great depth and magnitude. DiCaprio richly deserves his first Academy Award.\n\nI have never know much about Howard Hughes. This film opened my eyes to him as a personality, a businessman, aviator and his lavish lifestyle. DiCaprio no longer is the "pretty boy" from other films. The expressions he takes on are not handsome, the deeply furrowed brow, one could actually watch him, as Hughes' character, think his way through challenging situations, the mark of a highly gifted actor. Watching DiCaprio evolve into the paranoid schizophrenic Hughes in the latter part of the film is a stunning example of pure acting. Leo deserves recognition for recreating a most difficult personality.\n\nThough the film is long, it never slows down nor gets boring and it commanded my attention from start to finish.

DiCaprio becomes Howard Hughes. The actor is so profoundly absorbed in the role that the DiCaprio we know from other films cannot be found in this film. It is a bravura performance of great depth and magnitude. DiCaprio richly deserves his first Academy Award.\n\nI have never know much about Howard Hughes. This film opened my eyes to him as a personality, a businessman, aviator and his lavish lifestyle. DiCaprio no longer is the "pretty boy" from other films. The expressions he takes on are not handsome, the deeply furrowed brow, one could actually watch him, as Hughes' character, think his way through challenging situations, the mark of a highly gifted actor. Watching DiCaprio evolve into the paranoid schizophrenic Hughes in the latter part of the film is a stunning example of pure acting. Leo deserves recognition for recreating a most difficult personality.\n\nThough the film is long, it never slows down nor gets boring and it commanded my attention from start to finish. It is masterpiece cinema for these two men and for other actors too. Cate Blanchette must be commended for her role as Katherine Hepburn. Every role was played by first rate actors.\n\nIf you want to understand a piece of American history from the 30s through the 1940s, this film will illumine you.

I mean, I had decent hopes for it. Leading up to it, so many people seemed to be taking it way to seriously. I mean, come on. Its about giant talking turtles who fight crime. Its not supposed to be that serious. Hoo, boy.\n\nI guess I'll just start by saying this (spoilers ahead), the changes they made to the origin story don't make any goddamn sense, both in terms of simple logic and quality narrative structure. They completely removed any connection between Splinter and the Shredder, so say goodbye to any emotional connection or tension that that would have brought. And this version Splinter wasn't the ninja master, Hamato Yoshi or even a pet/student of Yoshi. In fact, Yoshi seems to have been omitted completely. So, how does Splinter become a ninja master himself? He reads a book. I'm not even joking. After both he and the turtles mutate he finds a book and teaches himself. And it wasn't even at the very beginning. I mean when Splinter begin teaching himself, the turtles are already walking and talking. He not only learned all of ninjitsu but also somehow mastered it, without any instruction or sparring, in less than ten years? AND he taught it to the turtles? BULLSHIT.\n\nThe turtles themselves are one of the few not-terrible parts of the movie. All of there individual personalities are right where they should be but we are also kind of short-changed on the amount of interaction they have with each other. A bunch of brothers together, getting up to shenanigans? What a great, natural way to have conflict! But no, the movie follows April way too much.\n\nAll of that is indicative of a larger problem with the writing. Both of the villains are BORING. The pacing is uneven and a lot of the dialogue is forced and ham-handed, Michelangelo was the worse in that respect. And believe me, I get it. Mikey is the loud mouth, party turtle. But is is possible (kind of necessary) that if a main character is annoying, to also be likable. Yes, it possible. Severus Snape. Perry Cox. Deadpool. These are all characters that are bad or annoying people but still likable as characters. After a few minutes of listening to Michelangelo, I just wanted him to shut the hell up. \n\nIt doesn't get any better with the villains. I don't remember the last time I watched a movie with such boring villains. Instead of just sticking with one main villain, the Shredder, we now have two...for some reason. WE have Eric Sachs, who is a rich scientist/industrialist and the Shredder, an evil ninja master with no personality. Eric Sachs is working for the Shredder for money? But isn't he already like a billionaire with a castle on a mountain and his own skyscraper?Doe he need more money? What the hell for? Shredder is the most shallow and one-dimensional out of this whole damn movie. We're not really told anything of his back story or shown any of his motivation for anything. The foot clan is also no longer a group of ninja warriors, they're...guys with guns. Completely useless guys with guns (that'll be relevant later).\n\nThey also unnecessarily tie April, Sachs and April's dad into the turtles' back story...for some reason. We don't even really meet April's father. And April is the one who saved them from the lab fire that killed her father...or wait, was it Eric who killed her father? The movie seems to confused on that point. And instead of keeping the baby turtles (like any little girl who likes animals would do) she...dumps them in the sewer? What the hell? The who thing is convoluted and doesn't make any damn sense.\n\nApril O'Neil is uninteresting and stupid. Seriously, I mean she is unintelligent. She is supposedly an educated journalist but spends so much time trying to convince he boss of a "story" of talking, crime- fighting turtles without one single goddamn lick of evidence. Vernon Fenway is apparently supposed to be the comic relief but none of his jokes are funny and his sole role in the film seems to be driving April around. And why the hell is Whoopi Goldberg in this? She had like six lines. Why is she here?\n\nThe camera-work was clichéd and chaotic. There were times when the camera was moving around too much for you to easily follow the action. There is also a serious lack of cool martial arts fights for a NINJA Turtles movie, which is not surprising when you turn their main antagonists from ninja into guys with guns. I also couldn't even begin to take the Shredder serious in the action scenes. Are those giant swiss army knives on his hands? What the hell?\n\nFinally, the one thing, in my opinion, that sort of breaks the movie the most is that they made the turtles too damn powerful. Yes, the turtles are kind of superheroes. But wasn't being a bunch of kick-ass ninjas enough? No? You gotta give them super strength too? AND MAKE THEM BULLET PROOF!? Remember the previously said bit about the foot being a bunch of guys with guns? Yeah...you might see where I am going with this. It was bad enough to see the turtles throwing cars around and shattering concrete with punches. On some level, the audience needs to believe on some sort of fundamental level that the heroes are danger, that the threats that they face have meaning. Without that, there is no tension, no real conflict and with that...no excitement. No story.\n\nThis movie nuked the fridge.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-09-03","keywords":"turtle,ninja,sewer,mutant,18 wheeler","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi295480345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Darkness has settled over New York City as Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians.

And this movie is updated version out of the series, now adding goof ball humour, sex and coolness factor in to the mix.\n\nThe angels this time are Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. Their boss still is Charlie and his right man Bosley is played by Bill Murray. The plot line goes in the lines of: important software stolen, get it back, who did it. But that matters very little, as the movie has only one aim: to be as cool as it is humanly possible. And when it get tired of being cool it just starts throwing goof ball humor left and right.\n\nI honestly have trouble of reviewing this film as a real movie, as it obviously doesn't even try to be one, but then again what is a real movie. Charlie's Angels is like one huge music video with action and gimmicks in it. The girls are pretty and do throw a couple of great lines and the action is just fine, but the truth is the movie doesn't hold up for multiple viewings. It is a fast food film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183420,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-01-17","keywords":"martial arts,undercover agent,based on tv series,spy,secret agent","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Charlie's Angels","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1029678105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VjNmUxNWQtNzk4ZC00NzE3LThlZDYtODc0YjAwZTA5ODE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VjNmUxNWQtNzk4ZC00NzE3LThlZDYtODc0YjAwZTA5ODE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Charlie's Angels"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000106/","name":"Drew Barrymore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005154/","name":"Lucy Liu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629334/","name":"McG"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148520/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0089889/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746598/","name":"Ryan Rowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004412/","name":"Ed Solomon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And this movie is updated version out of the series, now adding goof ball humour, sex and coolness factor in to the mix.\n\nThe angels this time are Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. Their boss still is Charlie and his right man Bosley is played by Bill Murray. The plot line goes in the lines of: important software stolen, get it back, who did it. But that matters very little, as the movie has only one aim: to be as cool as it is humanly possible. And when it get tired of being cool it just starts throwing goof ball humor left and right.\n\nI honestly have trouble of reviewing this film as a real movie, as it obviously doesn't even try to be one, but then again what is a real movie. Charlie's Angels is like one huge music video with action and gimmicks in it. The girls are pretty and do throw a couple of great lines and the action is just fine, but the truth is the movie doesn't hold up for multiple viewings. It is a fast food film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183420,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-01-17","keywords":"martial arts,undercover agent,based on tv series,spy,secret agent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Charlie's Angels","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1029678105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VjNmUxNWQtNzk4ZC00NzE3LThlZDYtODc0YjAwZTA5ODE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VjNmUxNWQtNzk4ZC00NzE3LThlZDYtODc0YjAwZTA5ODE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Charlie's Angels","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000106/","name":"Drew Barrymore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005154/","name":"Lucy Liu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629334/","name":"McG"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148520/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0089889/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746598/","name":"Ryan Rowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004412/","name":"Ed Solomon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Additionally, the special effects are truly spectacular to watch and will leave everyone smiling in amazement asking the question; how did they do that? The combination of live actors with voices of actors with incredible special effects immediately elevated "Cats &amp; Dogs" to a new level of greatness.

Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Michael Clarke Duncan and Sean Hayes combine their talents and voices to create an enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nIt is Mr. Tinkles and friends against Lou and friends in an ultimate battle for world domination.

Lou is sent in after the Brody's dog is lost to protect the family and formula.\n\nFive minutes was all it took to give "Cats &amp; Dogs" my approval because it contains so many impressive moments. Movie patrons will be glad to learn that it took me more than two hands to count the number of reasons to watch "Cats &amp; Dogs." From the special effects to the unique concept, "Cats &amp; Dogs" is going to please movie patrons across the United States. For example, the unprecedented battle scenes between the cats and dogs were creative and the humor, which came from the two species, left me laughing out loud. I knew "Cats &amp; Dogs" was going to be a smash hit; however, I didn't realize how much fun I could have watching the movie.\n\nThe combination of live actors with voice over actors made "Cats &amp; Dogs" more interesting because it was an element that makes the film more unique. For example, other films like "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" and "See Spot Run" are great in their own special way; however, when you add this added element, movie patrons are guaranteed to be entertained because of the unique and rarity of the occurrences.\n\nInstant credibility came to the movie the moment I heard the voices of Baldwin and Heston because these are among the best actors in Hollywood; however, everyone involved with this movie made it a success. I hope everyone enjoys this film as much as I did because it truly is an amazing film. "Cats &amp; Dogs" has my vote for the movie that will make people have the most fun. Congratulations to Goldblum and Perkins for turning in performances that made "Cats &amp; Dogs" a bigger success.\n\nAside from the special effects, the highlight of "Cats &amp; Dogs" is the performances by the live actors. For example, Goldblum is the only actor in Hollywood I could think of to play the role of the scientist because th role of the scientist brought him fame in "The Fly" series and again in the "Jurassic Park" series. Elizabeth Perkins seems to be tailor made for her role as mother; furthermore, she is extremely talented, I can't wait to see her next film.\n\nIn a summer that has contained animated and live action inventive family films, 2001 has added another with "Cats &amp; Dogs."

There are too many crime shows. Josh Schwarz delivers tongue in cheek humor and a good likable cast. It's a Dr Quinn meets Sweet Home Alabama story and it's quite charming. Zoe moves from NYC to Bluebell Alabama to practice medicine. The culture differences do provide enough laughs.\n\nRachel Bilson is Rachel Bilson just like Audrey Hepburn was always Audrey Hepburn. She may not be that convincing as a doctor but who cares - she is likable and manages to carry a series. The series relies on the other cast members equally. Jaimie King is pretty and acts well as the high strung Southern Belle Lemon. The male leads Scott Porter and Wilson Bethel aren't that good looking but suit their roles and are convincing actors.\n\nOverall pleasant and watchable - I'll keep watching and hope it lasts.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50577,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Cats &amp; Dogs" is the latest to join an elite list including "Atlantis: The Lost Empire," "Dr. Dolittle 2," "Spy Kids," "See Spot Run" and "Shrek;" proves family oriented films will entertain all ages.\n\n"Cats &amp; Dogs" is one of the most unique adventure films I have seen because it combines humor, intelligence and the technical savvy to call itself a box-office hit. Additionally, the special effects are truly spectacular to watch and will leave everyone smiling in amazement asking the question; how did they do that? The combination of live actors with voices of actors with incredible special effects immediately elevated "Cats &amp; Dogs" to a new level of greatness. The movie takes an incredible look inside a top-secret, high-tech espionage war between cats and dogs, which their owners are completely unaware. Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Michael Clarke Duncan and Sean Hayes combine their talents and voices to create an enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nIt is Mr. Tinkles and friends against Lou and friends in an ultimate battle for world domination. Mr. Tinkles is the leader of the cats as he tries to invade the Brody household to steal research for a formula that would make human allergies to dogs extinct. Lou is sent in after the Brody's dog is lost to protect the family and formula.\n\nFive minutes was all it took to give "Cats &amp; Dogs" my approval because it contains so many impressive moments. Movie patrons will be glad to learn that it took me more than two hands to count the number of reasons to watch "Cats &amp; Dogs." From the special effects to the unique concept, "Cats &amp; Dogs" is going to please movie patrons across the United States. For example, the unprecedented battle scenes between the cats and dogs were creative and the humor, which came from the two species, left me laughing out loud. I knew "Cats &amp; Dogs" was going to be a smash hit; however, I didn't realize how much fun I could have watching the movie.\n\nThe combination of live actors with voice over actors made "Cats &amp; Dogs" more interesting because it was an element that makes the film more unique. For example, other films like "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" and "See Spot Run" are great in their own special way; however, when you add this added element, movie patrons are guaranteed to be entertained because of the unique and rarity of the occurrences.\n\nInstant credibility came to the movie the moment I heard the voices of Baldwin and Heston because these are among the best actors in Hollywood; however, everyone involved with this movie made it a success. I hope everyone enjoys this film as much as I did because it truly is an amazing film. "Cats &amp; Dogs" has my vote for the movie that will make people have the most fun. Congratulations to Goldblum and Perkins for turning in performances that made "Cats &amp; Dogs" a bigger success.\n\nAside from the special effects, the highlight of "Cats &amp; Dogs" is the performances by the live actors. For example, Goldblum is the only actor in Hollywood I could think of to play the role of the scientist because th role of the scientist brought him fame in "The Fly" series and again in the "Jurassic Park" series. Elizabeth Perkins seems to be tailor made for her role as mother; furthermore, she is extremely talented, I can't wait to see her next film.\n\nIn a summer that has contained animated and live action inventive family films, 2001 has added another with "Cats &amp; Dogs."

I love to watch a good chic-flick. However, I was so disappointed. This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater.

I love to watch a good chic-flick. However, I was so disappointed. This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater.

The Griswolds blast off with unlimited optimism and good-natured anticipation of the fun they will have at Wally World. But the optimism gradually fades and is replaced by grim determination after a series of on-the-road disasters that make a mockery of idealism.\n\nThe film's humor lies in its absurd plot situations, and in the dialogue. At a cookout, a down-on-his-luck Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) treats the Griswolds to backyard burgers, then remarks to Clark: "I don't know why they call this stuff hamburger helper.

It's an adult version of "Looney Toons" and a worthy sequel!","reviewBody":"Chev Chelios was dead, but he got better.\n\nJason Statham returns as the lead in "Crank: High Voltage", and in every way this sequel breaks the rules and pushes the bar to insane new levels, sometimes even a bit too far.\n\nThree months after his "helicopter incident", Chelios awakens to see that Chinese black-market surgeons are slicing his famed "Chelios Heart" out (made famous by the fact that it kept beating after the events of the first film), and replacing it with a surrogate artificial heart, so they can keep him alive while they farm more of his organs.\n\nChelios escapes and discovers he has a whole new set of problems- his heart is connected to an external battery pack. When this battery pack runs out of juice, he only has one hour before his artificial heart stops and he dies. And of course one of the first things that happens is that his battery pack is smashed! Now Chelios has to keep his artificial heart beating with regular volts of electricity to recharge it, using anything he can- car power outlets, jumper cables, power stations, stun-guns- whatever he can get his hands on.\n\nHis goal- track down psychotic criminal Johnny Vang, who is seemingly parading around Chelios's heart in a miniature cooler, and get it back, so old friend and medical expert Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam in a returning role as the man who lets the audience know exactly what's going on) can put it back in.\n\nChelios is also being tracked by sadistic criminals sent by "El Huron", a crime lord who has some devious connections to Chelios and his past actions.\n\nThis film has a very convoluted plot, but like the first one, it works out rather well. One particular thing I enjoyed is that we spend a little more time with subsequent and secondary characters, like Chev's girlfriend Eve (the sexy Amy Smart), Venus (Efron Ramirez portraying the brother to his slain character Laylo from the first film), and other characters that come up. It just adds to the plot, and gives it more reality, in contrast to the literal circus of Mayhem that Mr. Chev Chelios is stirring up.\n\nSpeaking of returning characters, this film certainly has a lot of cameos from characters from movie number one, which was a delight for me as a fan. Fans of the first "Crank", you'll definitely get a kick out of some of the cameos in this entry.\n\nNow, onto the psychotic weirdness of the film. If you've seen the first film, you'll know it used strange tactics, like subtitles, graphics, and nightmarish imagery to put you inside of the heads of the characters. This film expands on that, by using and abusing subtitles, insane graphics, medical films, and more on a fairly regular basis. We even get a hilarious pseudo-flashback of sorts, and it is one of the most abrupt and brilliant segues I've ever seen to bridge two scenes.\n\nAnd on that note, I should mention that this film does play for laughs a lot more than the first film. In fact, there are scenes specifically written to play for laughs more than for actions. As a fan, that may sound disheartening (sorry, had to make a heart pun), but trust me, it works. The film definitely teeters on self-satire at times (including a uproariously funny line of dialog where Eve swipes at fans who would call Chev surviving the first film "impossible"), but it keeps it's balance and lets us know that its not taking itself too seriously, so the comedy fits right in.\n\nWriters/Directors Neveldine / Taylor also step the visuals up a notch. While not as haggard visually as the first film, this follow-up does have some pretty visuals, and is better-directed in terms of camera placement and editing in my opinion, and it fits right in with the first one. Their script is also to be commended for being so bold, with bizarre characters (I didn't even mention David Carradine going all "Charlie Chan"!), insane story lines, and one of the most over-the-top and unexpected finales I've seen in a long time. This isn't just an action movie, it's Looney Toons for grown-ups! It's the action equivalent of what "Evil Dead II" was to horror! It's brilliant in it's execution and definitely a step in the right direction for a sequel to "Crank"- not too serious.\n\nThis film literally left me in awe with its lunacy and action. If you loved the first film, then there's almost no way you won't love this entry.\n\nI give "Crank: High Voltage" an 8 out of 10, because like the first film, it's the ultimate rush, and now it's even the ultimate source for laughs!

Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed "Love American Style" on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. Each story is taking place in a different room of a hotel the same night. It was made between the time Tarantino made "Pulp Fiction" and worked on "Dusk Till Dawn" with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four stories:\n\n"The Missing Ingredient" - Madona has simply never looked better and her "come get me" dress will burn your eyeballs.

Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed "Love American Style" on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. Each story is taking place in a different room of a hotel the same night. It was made between the time Tarantino made "Pulp Fiction" and worked on "Dusk Till Dawn" with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four stories:\n\n"The Missing Ingredient" - Madona has simply never looked better and her "come get me" dress will burn your eyeballs. Alicia Witt plays her stock alienated teen and delivers sarcasm as only she can.\n\n"The Wrong Man" – Alexander Rockwell directed this segment shortly after directing "In the Soup" so he already knew how to get the most out of Jennifer Beals. Her diatribe about Ted's sex organ is a cinema classic.\n\n"The Misbehavers" – Rodriquez directs his favorite actor Antonio Banderas in something that is a throwback to classic Laurel and Hardy. Not only do his two kids misbehave when left alone in their hotel room, but their misbehavior is so comprehensive that the closing shot reveals a room of total anarchy. It is wonderful slapstick on a huge scale, with comic timing worthy of the Laural and Hardy and the Marx Brothers.\n\n"The Man From Hollywood" – This has the best script with Tarantino reserving the best stuff for his own character.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average.

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release, so I ended up getting a little more than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining, to say the least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location, two main actors and three supporting cast members?  While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper, add director Joel Schumacher (Bad Company, 8mm) into the mix, along with screenwriter Larry Cohen, who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago, and you have the perfect blend of blackmail, violence and extortion:  Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell).  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.  He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden (Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes).  Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue.  During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here.  While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters.  Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed.  However, all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland, who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't.  However, with a great story, top-notch directing and a cast with great chemistry, what more could you ask for?  Out of a possible five stars, I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher.  While I would go see it again and again, not everyone has the same tastes.  However, I would put down the $8 for a ticket to see the flick at least once.  If nothing else, it will make you stop and think:  the next time you enter a phone booth, just who will be watching?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-06-11","keywords":"single set production,psychopath,phone booth,sniper,hostage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Phone Booth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi932970777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150494/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169540/","name":"Larry Cohen"}],"duration":"PT1H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location, two main actors and three supporting cast members?  While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper, add director Joel Schumacher (Bad Company, 8mm) into the mix, along with screenwriter Larry Cohen, who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago, and you have the perfect blend of blackmail, violence and extortion:  Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell).  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.  He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden (Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes).  Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue.  During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here.  While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters.  Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed.  However, all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland, who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't.  However, with a great story, top-notch directing and a cast with great chemistry, what more could you ask for?  Out of a possible five stars, I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher.  While I would go see it again and again, not everyone has the same tastes.  However, I would put down the $8 for a ticket to see the flick at least once.  If nothing else, it will make you stop and think:  the next time you enter a phone booth, just who will be watching?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-06-11","keywords":"single set production,psychopath,phone booth,sniper,hostage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Phone Booth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi932970777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150494/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169540/","name":"Larry Cohen"],"duration":"PT1H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.\n\nThe characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a story from the characters' standpoint.\n\nTheir reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking supernatural surprise. This story applies these perspectives.\n\nIt's very well done in terms of writing, acting, and other aspects of execution, so it might have cross-over appeal to fans of horror, folklore, or straight period drama from colonial America.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":229562,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2016-02-19","keywords":"witch,goat,black magic,isolation,new england","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Commentary: Robert Eggers, Director of  'The Witch'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1994241305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc2OTQ2NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk5OTIwODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc2OTQ2NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk5OTIwODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Director Robert Eggers gives IMDb exclusive commentary about the trailer for his latest film, 'The Witch.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5896355/","name":"Anya Taylor-Joy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0408591/","name":"Ralph Ineson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225483/","name":"Kate Dickie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3211470/","name":"Robert Eggers"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226159/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0770908/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0356803/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3211470/","name":"Robert Eggers"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.\n\nThe characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a story from the characters' standpoint.\n\nTheir reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking supernatural surprise. This story applies these perspectives.\n\nIt's very well done in terms of writing, acting, and other aspects of execution, so it might have cross-over appeal to fans of horror, folklore, or straight period drama from colonial America.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":229562,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2016-02-19","keywords":"witch,goat,black magic,isolation,new england","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Commentary: Robert Eggers, Director of  'The Witch'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1994241305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc2OTQ2NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk5OTIwODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc2OTQ2NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk5OTIwODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Director Robert Eggers gives IMDb exclusive commentary about the trailer for his latest film, 'The Witch.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5896355/","name":"Anya Taylor-Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0408591/","name":"Ralph Ineson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225483/","name":"Kate Dickie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3211470/","name":"Robert Eggers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226159/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0770908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0356803/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3211470/","name":"Robert Eggers"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.\n\nBrave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.\n\nPixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.\n\nWhile this film may not be up there with Pixar's best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.\n\nBrave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":392722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"princess,mother daughter relationship,archery,female warrior,rebellious daughter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Families Legend","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678863641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom.

I've heard all of the bad reviews of this film. I am not oblivious to the fact this is a big budget Hollywood animation sequel, and I know that when some of you hear the word sequel, big budget, or even Hollywood, you automatically dismiss it as a trashy entertainment cash grab. But Finding Dory is more than a cash grabbing Hollywood sequel. It is the passing of the torch between generations. The older generations gift to the young generation, a chance for the young to experience the laughter, emotion and nostalgia of Pixar, and in particular, these characters of the finding Nemo universe.\n\nIs it better then Finding Nemo? Of course not. It's an unwritten law that the sequel can't be better. But is it unnecessary( as some of my fellow reviewers claim)? Well, it is just as unnecessary as Finding Nemo, or any other film for that matter of fact. In other words, it's not. When I was walking home from the cinema, I too questioned the necessity of this film. I thought for a while and came to the conclusion that this film does what any film does ( and what most sequels don't do). It tells a story, it grips us with adventure,comedy and emotion, it expands the characters and adds new lovable ones. What is unnecessary about that? Isn't that why we got to the cinema- to be entertained and to be moved? \n\nOne reason why I believe this film has received negative reception amongst the older generation( I am too aware that there are many lovers of this film too, maybe more so than haters) is that they thought this film was made just for them. They thought that this will be the nostalgic hit made specifically for them. But that is not what films ( and especially Hollywood and animated films) do. They speak to everyone from everywhere. They communicate messages and emotions that all ages from all countries can understand ( provided that the correct subtitles are in place!) I saw posts on Facebook saying "Parents: please don't take your kids to this film. I want to enjoy it. They won't understand the meaning of it!" And I agreed to this, especially when I was sitting in a cinema half full of 18-25 years old and the other half full of little kids. But it wasn't until I heard the laughter of the children during the film and the smiles on their faces afterwards that I truly understood the purpose of this film. It was Pixars way of allowing the young people of this generation to enjoy what the last generation of young people enjoyed. And that's the magic of a Pixar film, and as I said before, it was a way of connecting the generations to help both generations understand each other's love for this "universe". To understand and feel the magic, laughter and hopefully, one day a shared nostalgia and love for this great animation company and its characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258748,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-07-06","keywords":"fish,ocean,whale,octopus driving a truck,talking animal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2669917209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDE0NTE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQwNzk5ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDE0NTE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQwNzk5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish reunites with her loved ones, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001122/","name":"Ellen DeGeneres"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000983/","name":"Albert Brooks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0642145/","name":"Ed O'Neill"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533691/","name":"Angus MacLane"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0835194/","name":"Victoria Strouse"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've heard all of the bad reviews of this film. I am not oblivious to the fact this is a big budget Hollywood animation sequel, and I know that when some of you hear the word sequel, big budget, or even Hollywood, you automatically dismiss it as a trashy entertainment cash grab. But Finding Dory is more than a cash grabbing Hollywood sequel. It is the passing of the torch between generations. The older generations gift to the young generation, a chance for the young to experience the laughter, emotion and nostalgia of Pixar, and in particular, these characters of the finding Nemo universe.\n\nIs it better then Finding Nemo? Of course not. It's an unwritten law that the sequel can't be better. But is it unnecessary( as some of my fellow reviewers claim)? Well, it is just as unnecessary as Finding Nemo, or any other film for that matter of fact. In other words, it's not. When I was walking home from the cinema, I too questioned the necessity of this film. I thought for a while and came to the conclusion that this film does what any film does ( and what most sequels don't do). It tells a story, it grips us with adventure,comedy and emotion, it expands the characters and adds new lovable ones. What is unnecessary about that? Isn't that why we got to the cinema- to be entertained and to be moved? \n\nOne reason why I believe this film has received negative reception amongst the older generation( I am too aware that there are many lovers of this film too, maybe more so than haters) is that they thought this film was made just for them. They thought that this will be the nostalgic hit made specifically for them. But that is not what films ( and especially Hollywood and animated films) do. They speak to everyone from everywhere. They communicate messages and emotions that all ages from all countries can understand ( provided that the correct subtitles are in place!) I saw posts on Facebook saying "Parents: please don't take your kids to this film. I want to enjoy it. They won't understand the meaning of it!" And I agreed to this, especially when I was sitting in a cinema half full of 18-25 years old and the other half full of little kids. But it wasn't until I heard the laughter of the children during the film and the smiles on their faces afterwards that I truly understood the purpose of this film. It was Pixars way of allowing the young people of this generation to enjoy what the last generation of young people enjoyed. And that's the magic of a Pixar film, and as I said before, it was a way of connecting the generations to help both generations understand each other's love for this "universe". To understand and feel the magic, laughter and hopefully, one day a shared nostalgia and love for this great animation company and its characters.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258748,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-07-06","keywords":"fish,ocean,whale,octopus driving a truck,talking animal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2669917209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDE0NTE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQwNzk5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDE0NTE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQwNzk5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish reunites with her loved ones, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001122/","name":"Ellen DeGeneres","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000983/","name":"Albert Brooks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0642145/","name":"Ed O'Neill"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533691/","name":"Angus MacLane"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0835194/","name":"Victoria Strouse"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.\n\nLike I said, I was very pleasantly surprised.

Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.\n\nThe film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.\n\nIt is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.\n\nThen, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).\n\nThis love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.\n\nBeautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.\n\nAnd that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'. \n\n-Dan Henry, 20th July 2008","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1057247,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"robot,obesity,recycling robot,adrift in space,cgi animation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wall E","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192703769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Wall E - Trailer #3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123785/","name":"Ben Burtt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2264184/","name":"Elissa Knight"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307531/","name":"Jeff Garlin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0622634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714114/","name":"Jim Reardon"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Brilliant.\n\nDirector David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.\n\nThe film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.\n\nTheir final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.\n\nWhat I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.\n\nPart 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!\n\nThis paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.\n\nVisually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in.

The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films.

Brilliant.\n\nDirector David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.\n\nThe film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.\n\nTheir final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.\n\nWhat I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.\n\nPart 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!\n\nThis paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.\n\nVisually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.\n\nI will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films.

The singing was really good ... Emma Watson ... what a star! The acting was great. I was in two minds about seeing this as it's my favorite fairy story and my favorite Disney cartoon. I was in tears at the end, even though I knew the story backwards. Why didn't I give it 10 ... The thing that let it down a little for me was the make up of The Beast, I thought it was a little too scary for the film and the wolves were quite a bit nastier than the cartoon version. Young children may be scared by these things.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":293110,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast.

The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625090,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well, you'd be partially correct. Cage is definitely giving his wound tight hero routine that he's worked so hard to develop over the last half dozen films. As for the cheese factor, that's where you'll be surprised. Director Alex Proyas manages to deliver a rather decent sci-fi flick that has plenty of suspense and intelligence.\n\nThe plot turns around John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), an MIT astrophysics nerd turned Indiana Jones when a time capsule is discovered at his young son Caleb's (Chandler Canterbury) school. Inside are drawings from students in 1959 predicting what things would be like in 2009 some 50 years later. The drawing that Caleb comes home with isn't a drawing at all but a series of seemingly random numbers. Koestler becomes obsessed with the numbers and their meaning or what they seem to mean. The whole thing shakes him to his scientific core and a quest has begun.\n\nThe film is very lucky to have director Alex Proyas from films such as Dark City which is his true geek film and critical acclaim as well as I, Robot and Garage Days. The visual and special effects are outstanding. It was surprising how much suspense was in the script (Ryan Douglas Pearson and Juliet Snowden) which gave the film a real thriller atmosphere which continues to build in tone as the mystery is unraveled. \n\nI admit I went into this film expecting a rehash of National Treasure on a more global scale. The sci-fi aspect of the premise is very well thought out and told. The acting by co-stars (Chandler Canterbury, Rose Byrne and Lara Robinson) are solid performances and stand in complementary contrast to that of the tightly wound Nicolas Cage. The geek factor of Knowing is rather high with lots of number configurations and what-if scenarios which is great for the sci-fi fans.

All we need are CGIs and THX sound and films made by the marketing department of the studios to keep us happy! Give me more!

He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).\n\nOne day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!\n\nTrouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.\n\nJohn Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).\n\nAs for the acting.\n\nMacaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.\n\nJohn Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.\n\nAnd then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.\n\nPesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.\n\nAll in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.\n\n4.5/5 stars -","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":537336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-07-22","keywords":"christmas,home alone,slapstick comedy,burglary,child protagonist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Home Alone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi490651929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer: 25th Anniversary Edition"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000346/","name":"Macaulay Culkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827663/","name":"Daniel Stern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073707/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.","reviewBody":"No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- "The Pursuit of Happiness" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.\n\nThe great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me." But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.\n\nThis film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.\n\nIn short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting.

You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.","reviewBody":"No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- "The Pursuit of Happiness" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.\n\nThe great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me." But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need.

I do appreciate however a good romantic story. Also, I have NOT read the book, heck, never even heard of it until now.\n\nSo that said, here is my take. The haters seem to fall into three major categories.\n\nFirst, there are the "loved the book, hate the movie" types. Since I never read the book, I can't speak to this, other than to say, "Sorry, it's not the book, it's a movie". I always tell my kids that the medium of film is radically different than that of pulp and what "works" in one doesn't necessarily work in the other. Given that, one should go into a movie with an open mind, even if you've read the book.\n\nSecond, there are the "I never read the book, the movie didn't make sense". Now that I can talk to. I never did find myself all that confused. I think falls in large part to the fact that I never assumed the movie was supposed to be based on reality. I mean come on, given the rather obviously "fantastic" aspects of the story, it's not meant to be taken seriously. You're given an overarching concept (basically the power of love to do amazing things) and if you buy in, then the particulars are not really all that important. If you can't get beyond that, or simply don't buy into the central conceit, then you won't like the movie because it rides that wave for all it's worth.\n\nThird are the folks who thought the movie was too schmaltzy. Now that I would at least partially agree with. That said, again, the movie doesn't try to hide the fact that it wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's fair that if one does not go for that kind of thing, then you won't like this film.\n\nAll that said, I thought it was a "good" romantic film. My personal criticisms fall mainly on the somewhat wooden acting and the overall lack of "feel". That's right, despite all I said above there was just something about the film that just never really drew me into the characters. For some reason I never really felt truly emotionally invested in the characters. I didn't hate them, I did care, just not nearly as much as I thought I should. I also thought some of the acting was a bit forced and this might have contributed to not being able to lose myself in the characters. Almost like the actors did a good job of "acting" like the characters but never quite crossed into "being" the characters.\n\nSo if you're willing to accept the movie for what it is, an unabashedly romantic film that weaves religion as an integral part of the story, then I think that you will enjoy the film. It's not perfect by any sense of the imagination, but IMHO it's not nearly as bad as some folks are making it out to be."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53934,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2014-02-19","keywords":"flying horse,immortal,red haired woman,white horse,waiter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1637526297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODY1NjQ0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA2ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODY1NjQ0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA2ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"One night in winter, Peter Lake, orphan and master-mechanic, attempts to rob a fortress-like mansion on the Upper West Side.

I do appreciate however a good romantic story. Also, I have NOT read the book, heck, never even heard of it until now.\n\nSo that said, here is my take. The haters seem to fall into three major categories.\n\nFirst, there are the "loved the book, hate the movie" types. Since I never read the book, I can't speak to this, other than to say, "Sorry, it's not the book, it's a movie". I always tell my kids that the medium of film is radically different than that of pulp and what "works" in one doesn't necessarily work in the other. Given that, one should go into a movie with an open mind, even if you've read the book.\n\nSecond, there are the "I never read the book, the movie didn't make sense". Now that I can talk to. I never did find myself all that confused. I think falls in large part to the fact that I never assumed the movie was supposed to be based on reality. I mean come on, given the rather obviously "fantastic" aspects of the story, it's not meant to be taken seriously. You're given an overarching concept (basically the power of love to do amazing things) and if you buy in, then the particulars are not really all that important. If you can't get beyond that, or simply don't buy into the central conceit, then you won't like the movie because it rides that wave for all it's worth.\n\nThird are the folks who thought the movie was too schmaltzy. Now that I would at least partially agree with. That said, again, the movie doesn't try to hide the fact that it wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's fair that if one does not go for that kind of thing, then you won't like this film.\n\nAll that said, I thought it was a "good" romantic film. My personal criticisms fall mainly on the somewhat wooden acting and the overall lack of "feel". That's right, despite all I said above there was just something about the film that just never really drew me into the characters. For some reason I never really felt truly emotionally invested in the characters. I didn't hate them, I did care, just not nearly as much as I thought I should. I also thought some of the acting was a bit forced and this might have contributed to not being able to lose myself in the characters. Almost like the actors did a good job of "acting" like the characters but never quite crossed into "being" the characters.\n\nSo if you're willing to accept the movie for what it is, an unabashedly romantic film that weaves religion as an integral part of the story, then I think that you will enjoy the film. It's not perfect by any sense of the imagination, but IMHO it's not nearly as bad as some folks are making it out to be.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53934,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2014-02-19","keywords":"flying horse,immortal,red haired woman,white horse,waiter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1637526297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODY1NjQ0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA2ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODY1NjQ0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA2ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"One night in winter, Peter Lake, orphan and master-mechanic, attempts to rob a fortress-like mansion on the Upper West Side.

He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).\n\nOne day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!\n\nTrouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.\n\nJohn Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).\n\nAs for the acting.\n\nMacaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.\n\nJohn Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.\n\nAnd then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.\n\nPesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.\n\nAll in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.\n\n4.5/5 stars -","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":537336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-07-22","keywords":"christmas,home alone,slapstick comedy,burglary,child protagonist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Home Alone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi490651929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer: 25th Anniversary Edition"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000346/","name":"Macaulay Culkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827663/","name":"Daniel Stern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073707/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

An eight-year-old troublemaker must protect his house from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left home alone by his family during Christmas vacation." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0099785/","name":"Home Alone","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFkM2YwOTQtYzk2Mi00N2VlLWE3NTItN2YwNDg1YmY0ZDNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"An eight-year-old troublemaker must protect his house from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left home alone by his family during Christmas vacation.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0099785/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"MovieAddict2016","dateCreated":"2003-02-18","inLanguage":"English","name":"Heartwarming Holiday family classic.","reviewBody":"'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.\n\nMacaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).\n\nOne day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!\n\nTrouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.\n\nJohn Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).\n\nAs for the acting.\n\nMacaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.\n\nJohn Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.\n\nAnd then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.\n\nPesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.\n\nAll in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.\n\n4.5/5 stars -","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":537336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-07-22","keywords":"christmas,home alone,slapstick comedy,burglary,child protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Home Alone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi490651929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer: 25th Anniversary Edition","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000346/","name":"Macaulay Culkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827663/","name":"Daniel Stern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073707/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">The Pursuit of Happyness: Directed by Gabriele Muccino. With Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandiwe Newton, Brian Howe.

You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.","reviewBody":"No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- "The Pursuit of Happiness" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.\n\nThe great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me." But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.\n\nThis film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.\n\nIn short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting. Leaves you thinking about it for days!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-02-07","keywords":"motivational,passion,hardwork,hare krishna,american dream","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pursuit of Happyness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1413719065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1535523/","name":"Jaden Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610831/","name":"Gabriele Muccino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0175726/","name":"Steve Conrad"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.\n\nThis film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.\n\nIn short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting. Leaves you thinking about it for days!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-02-07","keywords":"motivational,passion,hardwork,hare krishna,american dream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pursuit of Happyness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1413719065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1535523/","name":"Jaden Smith"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610831/","name":"Gabriele Muccino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0175726/","name":"Steve Conrad"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is a promising medical student who seemingly lives a perfect life: he's a good son, a good boyfriend who has a good girlfriend and a good future. Then one day, it all changes when he gives a lift to a Swiss adventure-seeker named Clavis. He has sex with her and she calls him "the promising boy", which is the title of the film.

He clashes violently with his authoritative father who doesn't accept his radical behavior and is then left to manage by himself. He meets a group of musicians through a girl he bedded, Pit and VD.

He even writes a song with homosexual undertones, despite not being a homosexual. He is out to shock and rebel against everything that is considered normal and acceptable. Ergo, he is free from every sort of norm. This is what this film explores, does it really make you free to break every rule of the society or does it just make you feel like an outcast. In the end Slobodan returns to his previous life, after a motorbike accident where he again receives a blow to the head. His lost weekend is now over and he returns to his girlfriend and his parents. The freedom experiment has now ended. Or so he thinks...\n\nThe cast is really top notch here, with Aleksandar Bercek delivering perhaps his strongest role ever. Rade Markovic is also excellent as his father and Branislav Lecic also appears in one of his first movie roles as his karate instructor friend. Slobodan Aligrudic, Dusica Zegarac and Bata Zivojinovic also appear.

I saw this film at the 1993 San Francisco film festival.\n\n Set in that brief golden bubble of time, between the fall of Communism in Yugoslavia, and the outbreak of ethnic bloodshed, the movie was made almost entirely in Belgrade (now in Serbia). A beautiful portrait of the breakdown of one family, and the miraculous creation of a new one. Director Goran Paskaljevic chose 12-year Nikola Sarkovic from over 800 boys. Their teamwork brought one of the  most compelling performances by a child actor to the screen. The film was completed in Aug 92, only days before the escalation of the bloody civil war in Serbia that made on-site location work for *any* films impossible. If this film ever finds distribution, you can NOT afford to miss it.\n\n Nikola plays a gritty young capitalist-wanna be. He has far more sense and maturity with money than either of his parents, (his self-obsessed mother, Ina Gogalova, or philandering father, Miki Manojlovic). While his father dreams unrealistically of building a home based on income from being a wedding musician, Nikola dreams of getting a pop corn machine at the race track, so his family can make "real" money. The boy has gradually assumed many of his parent's adult responsibilities. He helps relieve his mother, by caring for her elderly charges, and even surreptitiously prompts his father with the right things to say to overcome serious marital rifts based on the father's philandering.\n\n After his father gets a promotion in a music academy, with strings attached, Nikola steps in to center stage to hold things together. He must care for the three elderly charges his mother runs errands for (she's in Bulgaria&gt; seeking a quack cure for the ailing sister) *and* he must take on two new charges, relatives of his father's boss. Nikola has already grown close to Señor Julio Popovitch (brilliantly portrayed by former Yugo mega pop singer, Mija Aleksic.) Nikola finds a deep friendship with the spunky old Tango singer who refuses to "give in," even though he's virtually bed-ridden.\n\n[In the director's talk after the screening, Paskaljevic revealed that the ailing Aleksic hadn't been able to work for 7 years. He was only allowed to work for two to three hours a day, with his doctor in attendance. With Life imitating Art, this wonderful performer grew stronger and stronger as the film progressed, and his doctor's new "prescription" was for Aleksic to make more films!]\n\n With the company of a dog he's inherited from a recently deceased "client," the pragmatic Nikola decides to simultaneously baby sit all of his elderly charges by bringing them together in a friendship club. Therein the magic of this film begins; like parched flowers in a spring rain, these wonderful old people "bloom" through friendship, romance, and a new-found sense of purpose. The gift of Goran Paskaljevic's direction prevents this from turning into sappy, sentimental sop like SMALL CHANGE. In a sense, each of Nikola's charges finds their own "tango," or dance of life. The film follows a path pitted with the very cul 'd sacs and dead ends that await any of us cursed with living long enough to become a "bother" to our adult children.\n\n Much of the film's freshness comes from a deft script and Zarkovic's no-nonsense portrayal of the determined twelve-year-old. Far from being the lovable "artful dodger" type of moppet most of us were weaned on in countless Disney films, this is a pint-sized "adult" with a mission. He'll stop at nothing to build a stable financial base for his family. Like many work-a-holic adults, he's become so enmeshed in enabling others, that he's forgotten how to care for his own needs. Only briefly, near the end of the film, when we see Nikola frolicking nude on a Montenegro beach under the loving, watchful eyes of his elderly `tango singer' friend, do we see him act freely and fully as a child. While his "real" family crumbles around&gt; him, he unknowingly brings together an enduring extended family. Warning: TANGO ARGENTINO has one of the most devasting, loving endings you will have ever seen. (I saw it 8 years ago).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"1992-02-17","keywords":"boy,male female relationship,male nudity,child's point of view,seduction","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017988/","name":"Mija Aleksic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0543547/","name":"Predrag 'Miki' Manojlovic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953521/","name":"Nikola Zarkovic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0664607/","name":"Goran Paskaljevic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076194/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045857/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036689/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586235/","name":"Gordan Mihic"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Zecevic understands that he´s making a splatter picture, so he´s not trying to be serious in any way (just like more famous likes of Braindead, Luther the Geek or The Last House on the Left) and he adds a few ridicolous laughs. The acting is more than good, maybe a little too good and sometimes it ruins caricaturical atmosphere.

They even added some amateur camera shots, but this is not The Blair Witch Project or Man Bites Dog.

I saw this film at the 1993 San Francisco film festival.\n\n Set in that brief golden bubble of time, between the fall of Communism in Yugoslavia, and the outbreak of ethnic bloodshed, the movie was made almost entirely in Belgrade (now in Serbia). A beautiful portrait of the breakdown of one family, and the miraculous creation of a new one. Director Goran Paskaljevic chose 12-year Nikola Sarkovic from over 800 boys. Their teamwork brought one of the  most compelling performances by a child actor to the screen. The film was completed in Aug 92, only days before the escalation of the bloody civil war in Serbia that made on-site location work for *any* films impossible. If this film ever finds distribution, you can NOT afford to miss it.\n\n Nikola plays a gritty young capitalist-wanna be. He has far more sense and maturity with money than either of his parents, (his self-obsessed mother, Ina Gogalova, or philandering father, Miki Manojlovic). While his father dreams unrealistically of building a home based on income from being a wedding musician, Nikola dreams of getting a pop corn machine at the race track, so his family can make "real" money. The boy has gradually assumed many of his parent's adult responsibilities. He helps relieve his mother, by caring for her elderly charges, and even surreptitiously prompts his father with the right things to say to overcome serious marital rifts based on the father's philandering.\n\n After his father gets a promotion in a music academy, with strings attached, Nikola steps in to center stage to hold things together. He must care for the three elderly charges his mother runs errands for (she's in Bulgaria&gt; seeking a quack cure for the ailing sister) *and* he must take on two new charges, relatives of his father's boss. Nikola has already grown close to Señor Julio Popovitch (brilliantly portrayed by former Yugo mega pop singer, Mija Aleksic.) Nikola finds a deep friendship with the spunky old Tango singer who refuses to "give in," even though he's virtually bed-ridden.\n\n[In the director's talk after the screening, Paskaljevic revealed that the ailing Aleksic hadn't been able to work for 7 years. He was only allowed to work for two to three hours a day, with his doctor in attendance. With Life imitating Art, this wonderful performer grew stronger and stronger as the film progressed, and his doctor's new "prescription" was for Aleksic to make more films!]\n\n With the company of a dog he's inherited from a recently deceased "client," the pragmatic Nikola decides to simultaneously baby sit all of his elderly charges by bringing them together in a friendship club. Therein the magic of this film begins; like parched flowers in a spring rain, these wonderful old people "bloom" through friendship, romance, and a new-found sense of purpose. The gift of Goran Paskaljevic's direction prevents this from turning into sappy, sentimental sop like SMALL CHANGE. In a sense, each of Nikola's charges finds their own "tango," or dance of life. The film follows a path pitted with the very cul 'd sacs and dead ends that await any of us cursed with living long enough to become a "bother" to our adult children.\n\n Much of the film's freshness comes from a deft script and Zarkovic's no-nonsense portrayal of the determined twelve-year-old. Far from being the lovable "artful dodger" type of moppet most of us were weaned on in countless Disney films, this is a pint-sized "adult" with a mission. He'll stop at nothing to build a stable financial base for his family. Like many work-a-holic adults, he's become so enmeshed in enabling others, that he's forgotten how to care for his own needs. Only briefly, near the end of the film, when we see Nikola frolicking nude on a Montenegro beach under the loving, watchful eyes of his elderly `tango singer' friend, do we see him act freely and fully as a child. While his "real" family crumbles around&gt; him, he unknowingly brings together an enduring extended family.

Before I watched this movie, my expectations weren´t high at all. I expected some cheezy awful mess of an attempt to make a good horror picture in Balkan (?!?). After watching it, I wasn´t thrilled in any way, of course, but still, I wasn´t disapointed either. It was a cheap serbian splatter horror that I could actually watch without much laughter. The premise, of course, is absolutely absurd. There are a few guys (and 2 girls) trapped in a turkish toilet in Belgrade and a psychotic killer is on the loose (yes, you´ve heard me correctly, the movie actually takes place in the toilet). And this absurdity took my attention. By the end I guessed the killer more than easily, but the director maked sure that we receive a few more surprises. Zecevic understands that he´s making a splatter picture, so he´s not trying to be serious in any way (just like more famous likes of Braindead, Luther the Geek or The Last House on the Left) and he adds a few ridicolous laughs. The acting is more than good, maybe a little too good and sometimes it ruins caricaturical atmosphere. What I dislike most in this movie is some kind of an experimental horror editing, which failed big time. They even added some amateur camera shots, but this is not The Blair Witch Project or Man Bites Dog. So, T.T.Syndhrome is by no means a great movie, but still a very brave effort of director Zecevic to direct something that has never been directed before in Serbia - a real splatter horror. Congratulations to Dejan.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":718,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-04-12","keywords":"slasher,turkish bath,gore,blood","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0198860/","name":"Sonja Damjanovic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0229314/","name":"Nikola Djuricko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0896249/","name":"Branko Vidakovic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954099/","name":"Dejan Zecevic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024321/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0196356/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954099/","name":"Dejan Zecevic"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Before I watched this movie, my expectations weren´t high at all. I expected some cheezy awful mess of an attempt to make a good horror picture in Balkan (?!?). After watching it, I wasn´t thrilled in any way, of course, but still, I wasn´t disapointed either. It was a cheap serbian splatter horror that I could actually watch without much laughter. The premise, of course, is absolutely absurd. There are a few guys (and 2 girls) trapped in a turkish toilet in Belgrade and a psychotic killer is on the loose (yes, you´ve heard me correctly, the movie actually takes place in the toilet). And this absurdity took my attention. By the end I guessed the killer more than easily, but the director maked sure that we receive a few more surprises. Zecevic understands that he´s making a splatter picture, so he´s not trying to be serious in any way (just like more famous likes of Braindead, Luther the Geek or The Last House on the Left) and he adds a few ridicolous laughs. The acting is more than good, maybe a little too good and sometimes it ruins caricaturical atmosphere. What I dislike most in this movie is some kind of an experimental horror editing, which failed big time. They even added some amateur camera shots, but this is not The Blair Witch Project or Man Bites Dog. So, T.T.Syndhrome is by no means a great movie, but still a very brave effort of director Zecevic to direct something that has never been directed before in Serbia - a real splatter horror. Congratulations to Dejan.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":718,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-04-12","keywords":"slasher,turkish bath,gore,blood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0198860/","name":"Sonja Damjanovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0229314/","name":"Nikola Djuricko","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0896249/","name":"Branko Vidakovic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954099/","name":"Dejan Zecevic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024321/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0196356/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954099/","name":"Dejan Zecevic"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It goes without saying that this makes "Sesir" a superior product to nearly all of those awful costume dramas, all that hollow chick-flick nonsense that's been coming out of Hollywood in recent decades, infested with nepotist zeros such as Emma Thompson or Keira Knightley. Serbia is neither known for having proper movie budgets nor for stylish productions, so the fact that Americans could produce so few movies that are anywhere nearly as good as this one speaks volumes about the rapid downfall of Tinseltown, at least in terms of quality. (Box-office-wise, Americans will always lead the way because they have the creation of mega-selling garbage down to a science by now.)\n\nObviously, "Sesir" isn't for movie-goers who consider Tarantino's films the height of artistic expression, or for those who consider his dialog to be semantic art. Nor is it for kids (and child-like young adults) who spend 5 hours a day on PlayStation. People who start fidgeting in their seats whenever 5 minutes pass without someone having their throat cut can also calmly and without hesitation delete this movie from their watch-lists. I don't want to sound like a snob, because I'm anything but, yet I have to warn all those who say "ej brate brate" in every sentence (the Serb equivalent to "yo bro" and "like, stuff") that they will be terribly bored with this film. Brain-damaged football fans and blood-thirsty city hillbillies (an exponentially growing demographic in Belgrade) will struggle to get anything useful or entertaining out of these characters and from the things they say. There are no scenes here whatsoever of characters smashing each other's brains in front of river discos while shouting obscenities and waving with their guns into the air ("j***m te u tri lepe p***e materina" and the like).\n\nI am not referring to the various quotes from Schiller, Goethe etc, of which there are many here. I am referring to the nostalgic, not overly sentimental, and somewhat (suitably) romanticized depiction of a bygone era, one that existed long before Paris Hilton pleasured her first celebrity penis. How times have changed – THAT message could be seen as the most relevant by-product of this movie, amongst all the other themes and points. "Sesir" is about intellectuals, the leading minds from Serbia's late 19th/early 20th century period. The professors are just as interesting though, if not more so; all of them. Fortunately, the decision was made to tell these stories as humorous anecdotes, not as a soppy costume chick-flick drama, as Americans would have done it. I could just see the likes of Sean Penn and Tom Cruise being miscast to play the professors, while the younger crop of even dumber, even less talented Tinseltown nitwits fill the roles of the students. Can American film-makers be trusted with ANY good story anymore? \n\nSome Serbian high school kids will watch this with bewilderment, because they will be shocked that there actually existed an age in which (some) professors and their students had a very friendly or at least cordial relationship, unlike these days when it's hard to measure whether the teachers hate the students more than that students hate the teachers. Of course this is a somewhat romanticized depiction; after all this is a movie not a documentary, but it is based on some documented facts. Those kids with the tiniest vocabularies (from the utterly useless "brate brate" generation) might nervously snicker at this film, trying to poke fun at its expense in their typical inferiority-complex, insecure way. Later on, these kids will wave their Serbian flags at weddings and football matches, shouting "Serbia!", because in this country quasi-patriotism is extremely popular and "proof" of one's moral high ground.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't want to give the impression that "Sesir" is something only for the older viewers. Young viewers, at least those that aren't complete morons, will find a lot to identify with despite some obvious differences between the old and the new mentalities, because Kosta's students – although very committed to self-advancement and education – also display a large dose of playfulness and teenage exuberance. Besides, the voters' demographics on IMDb reveal that "Sesir" is much more liked among younger than older viewers – although part of the explanation for this unusual fact is that young viewers tend to give much higher marks than older viewers, i.e. younger movie-goers are less critical i.e. many lack criteria.\n\n"Sesir" isn't perfect, but it doesn't have any notable flaws. Perhaps the only criticism is that the female part of the cast is inferior, as usual (in Serbian movies/TV), but that's hardly relevant since it is the male characters that dominate this story. I do recommend the TV series more though, which I believe includes all of the scenes from the movie, because it is far more detailed hence more entertaining."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1598,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-02-01","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0073353/","name":"Aleksandar Bercek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2161450/","name":"Milos Bikovic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1110617/","name":"Aleksandar Radojicic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815638/","name":"Zdravko Sotra"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232523/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815638/","name":"Zdravko Sotra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900008/","name":"Milovan Vitezovic"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I do recommend the TV series more though, which I believe includes all of the scenes from the movie, because it is far more detailed hence more entertaining.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1598,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-02-01","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0073353/","name":"Aleksandar Bercek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2161450/","name":"Milos Bikovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1110617/","name":"Aleksandar Radojicic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815638/","name":"Zdravko Sotra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232523/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815638/","name":"Zdravko Sotra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900008/","name":"Milovan Vitezovic"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The mouse is a young Russian named Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who arrives on the shores of the Volga River to defend Stalingrad, an important city in which the German's are attempting to capture. Zaitsev soon finds himself befriending a political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), who is impressed by the soldiers quick skills and decides to glorify him through the local press. Zaitsev becomes a political icon for the locals, giving them encouragement and increasing their hope for victory. \n\n\tThe cat is an opposing sniper named Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a famous sharpshooter called upon to kill Zaitsev. Koulikov (Ron Perlman), another talented sniper, is assigned to help Zaitsev in killing Koenig before the Major takes a victory shot.

Ed Harris is the standout actor here, in a harrowing, steadfast, juicy performance. Rachel Weisz cannot do a whole lot with her character, however. She often feels strained and contrived.\n\n "Enemy At The Gates" tries hard to express the subject of the media's influence in our culture. If the film, co-written and directed by Jean-Jaques Annaud  ("Seven Years in Tibet"), would have stayed on that concept, it would have been a whole lot better. The romance between Zaitsev and Tania is kind of unnecessary, and I am not sure if the sex scene is obligatory or advances their relationship. This love side story lacks passion; a lot of it feels mechanical and routine. "Enemy At The Gates" is still a consistently intriguing war film-rare because it does not involve Americans. While we are never really concerned about the outcome of the actual war, nor do we entirely care about several aspects of the main characters, there are many good scenes of suspense, and the overall mood of the movie is effective.

This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.\n\nThe film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":469637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1984-05-23","keywords":"india,prequel,shanghai china,indiana jones character,white savior","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2444476697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001009/","name":"Kate Capshaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702841/","name":"Ke Huy Quan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404754/","name":"Willard Huyck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0441718/","name":"Gloria Katz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":469637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1984-05-23","keywords":"india,prequel,shanghai china,indiana jones character,white savior","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2444476697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001009/","name":"Kate Capshaw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702841/","name":"Ke Huy Quan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404754/","name":"Willard Huyck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0441718/","name":"Gloria Katz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Has good moments but the problematic script turns it in the worst of the series so far","reviewBody":"19 years after a perfect ending to the trilogy, behold, George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford come together again to produce Indiana Jones' fourth adventure. This time, the film pays honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. The decision was certainly risky, since almost two decades had passed, having to introduce the character, now older and without the same mobility as before, to a new generation, in addition to having to overcome one of the most acclaimed trilogies of cinema at all times.\n\nThis fourth adventure by the American archaeologist continues to bring good doses of adventure, ingenious scenes and fun to those who follow. In the three Indiana Joness of 1981, 1984 and 1989, the MacGuffins are the treasures: the Ark of the Covenant, the Sankara stones and the Holy Grail, respectively. For the fourth film, Lucas wanted to put ETs in the middle; Ford and Spielberg, not so much. They reached a consensus that it is the translucent skull of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. David Koepp's script follows the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull structure, which is identical to that of Raiders of the Lost Ark: good guys and bad guys fighting for terrain in a race that will only be solved in the final corner. The difference is that in the new cat and mouse game, the Nazis leave and the Soviets enter the full 1950s.\n\nThe script seeks to fill in the gaps left by Connery (who refused to abandon retirement), Elliott (who died in 1992) and John Rhys-Davies (who overcharged) from creating obvious and unimaginative substitutes: the teacher Oxley, which Hurt is forced to interpret distantly, as if in a trance, for almost the entire film; the dean who appears at the head of Jim Broadbent; and the poorly developed assistant experienced by Ray Winstone. Meanwhile, paling in front of the villains of the original films, Cate Blanchett plays the Russian Irina Spalko in an absolutely caricatural way, never sounding threatening and letting her hairstyle, costume and accent do all the work of "composing" the character. On the other hand, it is undeniable that Lucas had a good idea in bringing an impetuous young man as a counterpoint to the aging protagonist, which, in an ideal world, could recapture the wonderful dynamics established by Ford and Connery in "The Last Crusade", oscillating only Indiana's stance towards the frowning side of the spectrum - and, in fact, this effort can be seen in the scene in which Mutt, after a bold move, looks with a proud smile at Indy, who returns a sullen expression (exactly as it had happened so many times in the 89 film). Unfortunately, this dynamic appears only punctually throughout the projection, which prefers to spend more time on the repeated (and only occasionally funny) references to the hero's more advanced age. Likewise, Marion's return is disappointing for not rescuing the explosive chemistry seen in Hunters, since everything here seems just an uninspired imitation of what happened in the original: the couple's fights seem forced, as well as the eventual (and inevitable) romance.\n\nThe irregularity of the script, however, is not only characteristic of the development of the characters. Contrary to what happened in the previous films, the Indiana Jones plot and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not only not interesting, it is also developed in a chaotic way. The plot of the crystal skulls is the worst of the entire series, even surpassing the already claudicating of Sankara stones in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: you never know what the skulls really are, what they can do, how they came to be here and why there is a need to return them. The story is so absurd that Spielberg, Koepp and Lucas simply have no idea how to end it, culminating in an ending that comes close to catastrophe.\n\nIf before Indy's missions were explained in a simple and objective way, putting the narrative in motion quickly, here the searches and deductions of the heroes take a long time - and the worst: nevertheless, they do not become clearer. Furthermore, although there is an obvious symbolic Catholic aspect in the presence of 13 aliens (Christ and the apostles), the nature of that temple and the objectives of the creatures are never clear. In fact, the fact is that the plot of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is simply bad - and Lucas's insistence on using it is probably the biggest factor responsible for the failure of this new film, since not even Indy's motivations are explained satisfactorily: why, for example, does he insist so much on "returning" the skull as Oxley wishes? And why did Ox, after failing in his first effort to enter the temple, return the artifact to the place where he had found it instead of saving it for later attempts? And why do certain creature (s) act that way at Irina's request? Unfortunately, instead of trying to refine the plot, Koepp tries to disguise the absurdities through ridiculous lines like "They went back to the space between the spaces" (in fact, practically everything that John Hurt has to say in this film hurts his ears).\n\nAnother thing that bothers is the fact that Spielberg sometimes treats the characters as unbeatable. Some of the best scenes in the entire series are forced and exaggerated, like the mine chase in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' or the classic truck moment in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. These sequences, however, also worked thanks to the reactions of the characters, who were surprised by the facts. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they seem to be sure they will never be hurt, resulting in moments that are difficult to swallow like the jump of Marion's jeep. There is a limit to common sense. Despite this, the action sequences mostly work. From the start in the car duel in the desert with Soviet soldiers, going through the whole sequence in the warehouse and in the bizarre ghost town (except the refrigerator scene, of course), the motorcycle chase in college, culminating in the forest race, including the falls in the geographically incorrect Iguazu Falls and the revelation of El Dorado, what we see is pure Indiana Jones, albeit with a Steven Spielberg much less inspired by evoking truly unforgettable moments. Again, he exaggerates like the endless sword fight on top of the cars and the dark "Tarzan moment" with Mutt in the vines, but, in general, the director gets it right by materializing Koepp's ideas in a harmonic set.\n\nHowever, with the exception of a motorcycle chase in the first act, nothing in this project reminds us of brilliant moments like Indy and the Nazi trucks (in Raiders of the Lost Ark), the chase on the underground tracks (in Temple of Perdition) or the tank fight (in The Last Crusade). Yes, there is a long fight over jeeps in the jungle, but the most that Spielberg can create is a beaten mutt gag being hit between the legs by the local vegetation. In addition, the sequence is orchestrated in a confusing, almost chaotic, bordering on laziness when, after the fight comes to an end, new Russian vehicles appear out of nowhere. In the same way, if the joke involving the tree that hits the communist agents hanging from the rock is even funny, it is sad to realize that, soon after, those same henchmen reappear next to Irina, as if nothing had happened. And why does Spielberg insist on showing agile natives hiding in the temple and other ruins if their nature is never explained clearly and they have no effect on the narrative's development?\n\nThe production tried to use the maximum of practical and stunt effects to avoid overuse of computer graphics. Despite using many practical effects, a 2008 production could not very easily evade CGI, and here I have it that Spielberg made a premeditated - and ultimately misunderstood - choice to make computer graphics emulate the effects practical that would have been possible, to a certain extent, in the 1980s, bringing an "old-fashioned" veneer to the film which, I am the first to say, sometimes seems strange. Even with all its problems, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull works at least as an exercise in nostalgia: it is pleasurable, as a movie buff, to review the Paramount logo turning into a real version that opens the adventure or accompanies the hero's path through the red line on a map. In addition, Spielberg is adept at rescuing all the language of previous films, from the constant travellings that bring us closer to the characters at dramatically relevant moments to the occasional backlight that marks the (here, only supposed) strength of the villains. Likewise, director of photography Janusz Kaminski does an impeccable job in recreating the style of the now retired Douglas Slocombe, recapturing his preference for shadows and silhouettes, for plans that reveal only the characters' eyes and for the elegant sepia tone that gives the film a classic tone that, even beautiful, does not betray the homage to the B productions made by the series. Not to mention another soundtrack by John Williams. How not to shiver with the Indy theme? Revisiting classics and showing that he is still a master at what he does, this trio - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford - proves that the new doesn't always mean the best. In some cases, luckily, the experience still has a lot to say.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2008-05-21","keywords":"area 51,sequel,alien,amazon,colon in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser trailer: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1622278425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, directed by Steven Spielberg."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Contrary to what happened in the previous films, the Indiana Jones plot and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not only not interesting, it is also developed in a chaotic way. The plot of the crystal skulls is the worst of the entire series, even surpassing the already claudicating of Sankara stones in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: you never know what the skulls really are, what they can do, how they came to be here and why there is a need to return them. The story is so absurd that Spielberg, Koepp and Lucas simply have no idea how to end it, culminating in an ending that comes close to catastrophe.\n\nIf before Indy's missions were explained in a simple and objective way, putting the narrative in motion quickly, here the searches and deductions of the heroes take a long time - and the worst: nevertheless, they do not become clearer. Furthermore, although there is an obvious symbolic Catholic aspect in the presence of 13 aliens (Christ and the apostles), the nature of that temple and the objectives of the creatures are never clear. In fact, the fact is that the plot of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is simply bad - and Lucas's insistence on using it is probably the biggest factor responsible for the failure of this new film, since not even Indy's motivations are explained satisfactorily: why, for example, does he insist so much on "returning" the skull as Oxley wishes? And why did Ox, after failing in his first effort to enter the temple, return the artifact to the place where he had found it instead of saving it for later attempts? And why do certain creature (s) act that way at Irina's request? Unfortunately, instead of trying to refine the plot, Koepp tries to disguise the absurdities through ridiculous lines like "They went back to the space between the spaces" (in fact, practically everything that John Hurt has to say in this film hurts his ears).\n\nAnother thing that bothers is the fact that Spielberg sometimes treats the characters as unbeatable. Some of the best scenes in the entire series are forced and exaggerated, like the mine chase in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' or the classic truck moment in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. These sequences, however, also worked thanks to the reactions of the characters, who were surprised by the facts. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they seem to be sure they will never be hurt, resulting in moments that are difficult to swallow like the jump of Marion's jeep. There is a limit to common sense. Despite this, the action sequences mostly work. From the start in the car duel in the desert with Soviet soldiers, going through the whole sequence in the warehouse and in the bizarre ghost town (except the refrigerator scene, of course), the motorcycle chase in college, culminating in the forest race, including the falls in the geographically incorrect Iguazu Falls and the revelation of El Dorado, what we see is pure Indiana Jones, albeit with a Steven Spielberg much less inspired by evoking truly unforgettable moments. Again, he exaggerates like the endless sword fight on top of the cars and the dark "Tarzan moment" with Mutt in the vines, but, in general, the director gets it right by materializing Koepp's ideas in a harmonic set.\n\nHowever, with the exception of a motorcycle chase in the first act, nothing in this project reminds us of brilliant moments like Indy and the Nazi trucks (in Raiders of the Lost Ark), the chase on the underground tracks (in Temple of Perdition) or the tank fight (in The Last Crusade). Yes, there is a long fight over jeeps in the jungle, but the most that Spielberg can create is a beaten mutt gag being hit between the legs by the local vegetation. In addition, the sequence is orchestrated in a confusing, almost chaotic, bordering on laziness when, after the fight comes to an end, new Russian vehicles appear out of nowhere. In the same way, if the joke involving the tree that hits the communist agents hanging from the rock is even funny, it is sad to realize that, soon after, those same henchmen reappear next to Irina, as if nothing had happened. And why does Spielberg insist on showing agile natives hiding in the temple and other ruins if their nature is never explained clearly and they have no effect on the narrative's development?\n\nThe production tried to use the maximum of practical and stunt effects to avoid overuse of computer graphics. Despite using many practical effects, a 2008 production could not very easily evade CGI, and here I have it that Spielberg made a premeditated - and ultimately misunderstood - choice to make computer graphics emulate the effects practical that would have been possible, to a certain extent, in the 1980s, bringing an "old-fashioned" veneer to the film which, I am the first to say, sometimes seems strange. Even with all its problems, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull works at least as an exercise in nostalgia: it is pleasurable, as a movie buff, to review the Paramount logo turning into a real version that opens the adventure or accompanies the hero's path through the red line on a map. In addition, Spielberg is adept at rescuing all the language of previous films, from the constant travellings that bring us closer to the characters at dramatically relevant moments to the occasional backlight that marks the (here, only supposed) strength of the villains. Likewise, director of photography Janusz Kaminski does an impeccable job in recreating the style of the now retired Douglas Slocombe, recapturing his preference for shadows and silhouettes, for plans that reveal only the characters' eyes and for the elegant sepia tone that gives the film a classic tone that, even beautiful, does not betray the homage to the B productions made by the series. Not to mention another soundtrack by John Williams. How not to shiver with the Indy theme? Revisiting classics and showing that he is still a master at what he does, this trio - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford - proves that the new doesn't always mean the best. In some cases, luckily, the experience still has a lot to say.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2008-05-21","keywords":"area 51,sequel,alien,amazon,colon in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser trailer: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1622278425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, directed by Steven Spielberg.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  "Die Hard" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since "Die Hard" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of "Die Hard" . . . or, for that matter, is better than "Die Hard".\n\n "Die Hard" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .\n\nKudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, "Die Hard" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, "Die Hard" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With "Die Hard", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.\n\nAs for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.\n\nAlso worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual "damsel in distress" mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.\n\n"Die Hard" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is "Die Hard" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.

Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  "Die Hard" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since "Die Hard" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of "Die Hard" . . . or, for that matter, is better than "Die Hard".\n\n "Die Hard" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .\n\nKudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, "Die Hard" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, "Die Hard" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With "Die Hard", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.\n\nAs for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.\n\nAlso worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual "damsel in distress" mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.\n\n"Die Hard" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is "Die Hard" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.

Has good moments but the problematic script turns it in the worst of the series so far","reviewBody":"19 years after a perfect ending to the trilogy, behold, George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford come together again to produce Indiana Jones' fourth adventure. This time, the film pays honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. The decision was certainly risky, since almost two decades had passed, having to introduce the character, now older and without the same mobility as before, to a new generation, in addition to having to overcome one of the most acclaimed trilogies of cinema at all times.\n\nThis fourth adventure by the American archaeologist continues to bring good doses of adventure, ingenious scenes and fun to those who follow. In the three Indiana Joness of 1981, 1984 and 1989, the MacGuffins are the treasures: the Ark of the Covenant, the Sankara stones and the Holy Grail, respectively. For the fourth film, Lucas wanted to put ETs in the middle; Ford and Spielberg, not so much. They reached a consensus that it is the translucent skull of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. David Koepp's script follows the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull structure, which is identical to that of Raiders of the Lost Ark: good guys and bad guys fighting for terrain in a race that will only be solved in the final corner. The difference is that in the new cat and mouse game, the Nazis leave and the Soviets enter the full 1950s.\n\nThe script seeks to fill in the gaps left by Connery (who refused to abandon retirement), Elliott (who died in 1992) and John Rhys-Davies (who overcharged) from creating obvious and unimaginative substitutes: the teacher Oxley, which Hurt is forced to interpret distantly, as if in a trance, for almost the entire film; the dean who appears at the head of Jim Broadbent; and the poorly developed assistant experienced by Ray Winstone. Meanwhile, paling in front of the villains of the original films, Cate Blanchett plays the Russian Irina Spalko in an absolutely caricatural way, never sounding threatening and letting her hairstyle, costume and accent do all the work of "composing" the character. On the other hand, it is undeniable that Lucas had a good idea in bringing an impetuous young man as a counterpoint to the aging protagonist, which, in an ideal world, could recapture the wonderful dynamics established by Ford and Connery in "The Last Crusade", oscillating only Indiana's stance towards the frowning side of the spectrum - and, in fact, this effort can be seen in the scene in which Mutt, after a bold move, looks with a proud smile at Indy, who returns a sullen expression (exactly as it had happened so many times in the 89 film). Unfortunately, this dynamic appears only punctually throughout the projection, which prefers to spend more time on the repeated (and only occasionally funny) references to the hero's more advanced age. Likewise, Marion's return is disappointing for not rescuing the explosive chemistry seen in Hunters, since everything here seems just an uninspired imitation of what happened in the original: the couple's fights seem forced, as well as the eventual (and inevitable) romance.\n\nThe irregularity of the script, however, is not only characteristic of the development of the characters. Contrary to what happened in the previous films, the Indiana Jones plot and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not only not interesting, it is also developed in a chaotic way. The plot of the crystal skulls is the worst of the entire series, even surpassing the already claudicating of Sankara stones in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: you never know what the skulls really are, what they can do, how they came to be here and why there is a need to return them. The story is so absurd that Spielberg, Koepp and Lucas simply have no idea how to end it, culminating in an ending that comes close to catastrophe.\n\nIf before Indy's missions were explained in a simple and objective way, putting the narrative in motion quickly, here the searches and deductions of the heroes take a long time - and the worst: nevertheless, they do not become clearer. Furthermore, although there is an obvious symbolic Catholic aspect in the presence of 13 aliens (Christ and the apostles), the nature of that temple and the objectives of the creatures are never clear. In fact, the fact is that the plot of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is simply bad - and Lucas's insistence on using it is probably the biggest factor responsible for the failure of this new film, since not even Indy's motivations are explained satisfactorily: why, for example, does he insist so much on "returning" the skull as Oxley wishes? And why did Ox, after failing in his first effort to enter the temple, return the artifact to the place where he had found it instead of saving it for later attempts? And why do certain creature (s) act that way at Irina's request? Unfortunately, instead of trying to refine the plot, Koepp tries to disguise the absurdities through ridiculous lines like "They went back to the space between the spaces" (in fact, practically everything that John Hurt has to say in this film hurts his ears).\n\nAnother thing that bothers is the fact that Spielberg sometimes treats the characters as unbeatable. Some of the best scenes in the entire series are forced and exaggerated, like the mine chase in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' or the classic truck moment in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. These sequences, however, also worked thanks to the reactions of the characters, who were surprised by the facts. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they seem to be sure they will never be hurt, resulting in moments that are difficult to swallow like the jump of Marion's jeep. There is a limit to common sense. Despite this, the action sequences mostly work. From the start in the car duel in the desert with Soviet soldiers, going through the whole sequence in the warehouse and in the bizarre ghost town (except the refrigerator scene, of course), the motorcycle chase in college, culminating in the forest race, including the falls in the geographically incorrect Iguazu Falls and the revelation of El Dorado, what we see is pure Indiana Jones, albeit with a Steven Spielberg much less inspired by evoking truly unforgettable moments. Again, he exaggerates like the endless sword fight on top of the cars and the dark "Tarzan moment" with Mutt in the vines, but, in general, the director gets it right by materializing Koepp's ideas in a harmonic set.\n\nHowever, with the exception of a motorcycle chase in the first act, nothing in this project reminds us of brilliant moments like Indy and the Nazi trucks (in Raiders of the Lost Ark), the chase on the underground tracks (in Temple of Perdition) or the tank fight (in The Last Crusade). Yes, there is a long fight over jeeps in the jungle, but the most that Spielberg can create is a beaten mutt gag being hit between the legs by the local vegetation. In addition, the sequence is orchestrated in a confusing, almost chaotic, bordering on laziness when, after the fight comes to an end, new Russian vehicles appear out of nowhere. In the same way, if the joke involving the tree that hits the communist agents hanging from the rock is even funny, it is sad to realize that, soon after, those same henchmen reappear next to Irina, as if nothing had happened. And why does Spielberg insist on showing agile natives hiding in the temple and other ruins if their nature is never explained clearly and they have no effect on the narrative's development?\n\nThe production tried to use the maximum of practical and stunt effects to avoid overuse of computer graphics. Despite using many practical effects, a 2008 production could not very easily evade CGI, and here I have it that Spielberg made a premeditated - and ultimately misunderstood - choice to make computer graphics emulate the effects practical that would have been possible, to a certain extent, in the 1980s, bringing an "old-fashioned" veneer to the film which, I am the first to say, sometimes seems strange. Even with all its problems, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull works at least as an exercise in nostalgia: it is pleasurable, as a movie buff, to review the Paramount logo turning into a real version that opens the adventure or accompanies the hero's path through the red line on a map. In addition, Spielberg is adept at rescuing all the language of previous films, from the constant travellings that bring us closer to the characters at dramatically relevant moments to the occasional backlight that marks the (here, only supposed) strength of the villains. Likewise, director of photography Janusz Kaminski does an impeccable job in recreating the style of the now retired Douglas Slocombe, recapturing his preference for shadows and silhouettes, for plans that reveal only the characters' eyes and for the elegant sepia tone that gives the film a classic tone that, even beautiful, does not betray the homage to the B productions made by the series.

Has good moments but the problematic script turns it in the worst of the series so far","reviewBody":"19 years after a perfect ending to the trilogy, behold, George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford come together again to produce Indiana Jones' fourth adventure. This time, the film pays honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. The decision was certainly risky, since almost two decades had passed, having to introduce the character, now older and without the same mobility as before, to a new generation, in addition to having to overcome one of the most acclaimed trilogies of cinema at all times.\n\nThis fourth adventure by the American archaeologist continues to bring good doses of adventure, ingenious scenes and fun to those who follow. In the three Indiana Joness of 1981, 1984 and 1989, the MacGuffins are the treasures: the Ark of the Covenant, the Sankara stones and the Holy Grail, respectively. For the fourth film, Lucas wanted to put ETs in the middle; Ford and Spielberg, not so much. They reached a consensus that it is the translucent skull of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. David Koepp's script follows the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull structure, which is identical to that of Raiders of the Lost Ark: good guys and bad guys fighting for terrain in a race that will only be solved in the final corner. The difference is that in the new cat and mouse game, the Nazis leave and the Soviets enter the full 1950s.\n\nThe script seeks to fill in the gaps left by Connery (who refused to abandon retirement), Elliott (who died in 1992) and John Rhys-Davies (who overcharged) from creating obvious and unimaginative substitutes: the teacher Oxley, which Hurt is forced to interpret distantly, as if in a trance, for almost the entire film; the dean who appears at the head of Jim Broadbent; and the poorly developed assistant experienced by Ray Winstone. Meanwhile, paling in front of the villains of the original films, Cate Blanchett plays the Russian Irina Spalko in an absolutely caricatural way, never sounding threatening and letting her hairstyle, costume and accent do all the work of "composing" the character. On the other hand, it is undeniable that Lucas had a good idea in bringing an impetuous young man as a counterpoint to the aging protagonist, which, in an ideal world, could recapture the wonderful dynamics established by Ford and Connery in "The Last Crusade", oscillating only Indiana's stance towards the frowning side of the spectrum - and, in fact, this effort can be seen in the scene in which Mutt, after a bold move, looks with a proud smile at Indy, who returns a sullen expression (exactly as it had happened so many times in the 89 film). Unfortunately, this dynamic appears only punctually throughout the projection, which prefers to spend more time on the repeated (and only occasionally funny) references to the hero's more advanced age. Likewise, Marion's return is disappointing for not rescuing the explosive chemistry seen in Hunters, since everything here seems just an uninspired imitation of what happened in the original: the couple's fights seem forced, as well as the eventual (and inevitable) romance.\n\nThe irregularity of the script, however, is not only characteristic of the development of the characters. Contrary to what happened in the previous films, the Indiana Jones plot and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not only not interesting, it is also developed in a chaotic way. The plot of the crystal skulls is the worst of the entire series, even surpassing the already claudicating of Sankara stones in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: you never know what the skulls really are, what they can do, how they came to be here and why there is a need to return them. The story is so absurd that Spielberg, Koepp and Lucas simply have no idea how to end it, culminating in an ending that comes close to catastrophe.\n\nIf before Indy's missions were explained in a simple and objective way, putting the narrative in motion quickly, here the searches and deductions of the heroes take a long time - and the worst: nevertheless, they do not become clearer. Furthermore, although there is an obvious symbolic Catholic aspect in the presence of 13 aliens (Christ and the apostles), the nature of that temple and the objectives of the creatures are never clear. In fact, the fact is that the plot of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is simply bad - and Lucas's insistence on using it is probably the biggest factor responsible for the failure of this new film, since not even Indy's motivations are explained satisfactorily: why, for example, does he insist so much on "returning" the skull as Oxley wishes? And why did Ox, after failing in his first effort to enter the temple, return the artifact to the place where he had found it instead of saving it for later attempts? And why do certain creature (s) act that way at Irina's request? Unfortunately, instead of trying to refine the plot, Koepp tries to disguise the absurdities through ridiculous lines like "They went back to the space between the spaces" (in fact, practically everything that John Hurt has to say in this film hurts his ears).\n\nAnother thing that bothers is the fact that Spielberg sometimes treats the characters as unbeatable. Some of the best scenes in the entire series are forced and exaggerated, like the mine chase in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' or the classic truck moment in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. These sequences, however, also worked thanks to the reactions of the characters, who were surprised by the facts. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they seem to be sure they will never be hurt, resulting in moments that are difficult to swallow like the jump of Marion's jeep. There is a limit to common sense. Despite this, the action sequences mostly work. From the start in the car duel in the desert with Soviet soldiers, going through the whole sequence in the warehouse and in the bizarre ghost town (except the refrigerator scene, of course), the motorcycle chase in college, culminating in the forest race, including the falls in the geographically incorrect Iguazu Falls and the revelation of El Dorado, what we see is pure Indiana Jones, albeit with a Steven Spielberg much less inspired by evoking truly unforgettable moments. Again, he exaggerates like the endless sword fight on top of the cars and the dark "Tarzan moment" with Mutt in the vines, but, in general, the director gets it right by materializing Koepp's ideas in a harmonic set.\n\nHowever, with the exception of a motorcycle chase in the first act, nothing in this project reminds us of brilliant moments like Indy and the Nazi trucks (in Raiders of the Lost Ark), the chase on the underground tracks (in Temple of Perdition) or the tank fight (in The Last Crusade). Yes, there is a long fight over jeeps in the jungle, but the most that Spielberg can create is a beaten mutt gag being hit between the legs by the local vegetation. In addition, the sequence is orchestrated in a confusing, almost chaotic, bordering on laziness when, after the fight comes to an end, new Russian vehicles appear out of nowhere. In the same way, if the joke involving the tree that hits the communist agents hanging from the rock is even funny, it is sad to realize that, soon after, those same henchmen reappear next to Irina, as if nothing had happened. And why does Spielberg insist on showing agile natives hiding in the temple and other ruins if their nature is never explained clearly and they have no effect on the narrative's development?\n\nThe production tried to use the maximum of practical and stunt effects to avoid overuse of computer graphics. Despite using many practical effects, a 2008 production could not very easily evade CGI, and here I have it that Spielberg made a premeditated - and ultimately misunderstood - choice to make computer graphics emulate the effects practical that would have been possible, to a certain extent, in the 1980s, bringing an "old-fashioned" veneer to the film which, I am the first to say, sometimes seems strange. Even with all its problems, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull works at least as an exercise in nostalgia: it is pleasurable, as a movie buff, to review the Paramount logo turning into a real version that opens the adventure or accompanies the hero's path through the red line on a map. In addition, Spielberg is adept at rescuing all the language of previous films, from the constant travellings that bring us closer to the characters at dramatically relevant moments to the occasional backlight that marks the (here, only supposed) strength of the villains. Likewise, director of photography Janusz Kaminski does an impeccable job in recreating the style of the now retired Douglas Slocombe, recapturing his preference for shadows and silhouettes, for plans that reveal only the characters' eyes and for the elegant sepia tone that gives the film a classic tone that, even beautiful, does not betray the homage to the B productions made by the series. Not to mention another soundtrack by John Williams. How not to shiver with the Indy theme? Revisiting classics and showing that he is still a master at what he does, this trio - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford - proves that the new doesn't always mean the best. In some cases, luckily, the experience still has a lot to say.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2008-05-21","keywords":"area 51,sequel,alien,amazon,colon in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser trailer: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1622278425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, directed by Steven Spielberg.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse.  Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques.  As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.\n\nBased on a true story, although it doesn't rely on `and it really happened' to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation.  The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale.  It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to.  It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.\n\nThe presentation is good.  Williams' score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick.  Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period.  The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn't fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth.  But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn't set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.\n\nThe cast is good even if they aren't all used well.  If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I'll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I'm not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy.  Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio.  Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.\n\nOverall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.  If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the past two hours!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":907490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"impostor,con,race against time,deception,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Catch Me If You Can","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220346137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxM2UxZTUtMzFlZS00YTVjLWFkNzctZjQzZjMwN2ZlNTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxM2UxZTUtMzFlZS00YTVjLWFkNzctZjQzZjMwN2ZlNTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000686/","name":"Christopher Walken"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0112912/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007646/","name":"Frank Abagnale Jr."},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1127221/","name":"Stan Redding"}],"duration":"PT2H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much "bling". Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.\n\nThe film Blood Diamond puts an entirely new spin on Antwerp, the diamond industry and that pricey stone you might be wearing around your neck, on your ring finger, or in your ears (mine are cubic-Zs). Set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s, this historical-adventure-drama covers a time when the country was in turmoil. Warlords, smugglers and the diamond syndicate all play roles in a refugee exodus, and the killing and enslaving of men to work the diamond fields. The title refers to diamonds which are harvested, smuggled and traded to finance the purchase of weapons used in Civil War.\n\nSolomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) stars as a fisherman who has his family torn apart and instead of being killed, is sent to work mining diamonds where he finds and hides a large stone. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former mercenary, diamond-smuggler, middleman, you-name-it, is looking to score with that stone and exit the business for good. Writer Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is tired of writing shallow stories about less than newsworthy events; she is looking for information about major players in the diamond trade. They all come together in a fast paced, adventure packed piece of film-making that is brutal at times but never boring. The film has a pleasant, unanticipated ending, something hard to pull off in a film of this kind.\n\nDirector/Producer Edward Zwick is probably the best in Hollywood at taking a big budget feature film with a historical theme and carefully relay a message without lecturing his audience. His earlier works include a story of the first all-black U.S. Civil War company in "Glory" a film, which resulted in Denzel Washington winning his first Oscar. Zwick takes credit for works like The Last Samurai, Shakespeare in Love, Traffic and Courage Under Fire. He is second to no one when it comes to balancing a historical event with action-drama entertainment. Edward Zwick is one of few L.A. directors who still works within the Hollywood establishment yet is able to put out good quality film. \n\nCheck out Blood Diamond, your "bling" may never look the same again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":526088,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-01-31","keywords":"civil war,diamond,rebel,sierra leone,journalist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blood Diamond","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi180027673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4ZTNiYzMtMjYzYy00YTg4LWIxMDYtZmQ1NDE1M2ZjNjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4ZTNiYzMtMjYzYy00YTg4LWIxMDYtZmQ1NDE1M2ZjNjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001880/","name":"Edward Zwick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167271/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114242/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495378/","name":"Charles Leavitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2057149/","name":"C.

She summons the hit-man Deadshot (Will Smith); The Joker's girlfriend and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie); the pyrokinetic Diablo (Jay Hernandez); the bank thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney); the mutant Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); the criminal Slipknot (Adam Beach); and the witch Enchantress that possessed the former archaeologist June Moone (Cara Delevingne) to form The Task Force X. Waller also assigns the command of the team to Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who is in love with June. To convince the group to obey orders, a nano bomb is implanted in the neck of each member. When Enchantress releases her powerful brother and they besiege Midway City turning the residents into an army of monsters and building a powerful weapon. Meanwhile The Joker (Jared Leto) is plotting a plan to rescue his beloved Harley Quinn.\n\n"Suicide Squad" is a deceptive film with a lame story and terrible director that waste a magnificent cast.

She summons the hit-man Deadshot (Will Smith); The Joker's girlfriend and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie); the pyrokinetic Diablo (Jay Hernandez); the bank thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney); the mutant Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); the criminal Slipknot (Adam Beach); and the witch Enchantress that possessed the former archaeologist June Moone (Cara Delevingne) to form The Task Force X. Waller also assigns the command of the team to Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who is in love with June. To convince the group to obey orders, a nano bomb is implanted in the neck of each member. When Enchantress releases her powerful brother and they besiege Midway City turning the residents into an army of monsters and building a powerful weapon. Meanwhile The Joker (Jared Leto) is plotting a plan to rescue his beloved Harley Quinn.\n\n"Suicide Squad" is a deceptive film with a lame story and terrible director that waste a magnificent cast.

On je istovremeno ogorčen, osvetoljubiv, usamljen i nasilan, vođen ličnom osvetom. U svom pohodu da oslobodi stanovnike Engleske od korupcije i surovosti koje su zatrovale njihove vlasti, V osuđuje tiransku prirodu vođa i poziva svoje sugrađane da mu se pridruže u senci parlamenta 5. novembra - na dan Gaja Foksa. Tog dana 1605. godine Gaj Foks je zatečen u tunelu ispod parlamenta sa trideset šest buradi baruta. On i drugi zaverenici su organizovali "Barutnu zaveru" kao odgovor na tiraniju njihove vlasti pod Džejmsom I. Foks i njegovi saučesnici saboteri su obešeni, rasporeni i raščerečeni, a njihov plan da sruše vlast nikada nije uspeo. U pobunjeničkom duhu u znak sećanja na taj dan, V se zavetovao da sprovede zaveru koju je Foks pokušao da sprovede 5. novembra 1605: da digne parlament u vazduh. Nakon što je je Evi razotkrila istinu V-ove tajanstvene prošlosti, ona otkriva istinu i o sebi i postaje njegov nevoljni saveznik u kulminaciji njegovog plana da pokrene revoluciju i vrati slobodu i pravdu društvu zastrašenom surovošću i korupcijom.</desc>

Because there was a lot to like in this movie. I like Mark Wahlberg. I like the bear. I like Amanda Seyfried. And there were a lot of good laughs in this movie. Good one-liners, and good recurring gags.\n\nHowever, it just wasn't enough to make up for a horrible plot. The plot is lifted from "Miracle on 43rd Street." But it is not Christmas, Ted is not Santa. Somehow Ted does not rise to the mythical level of Santa, this is not a movie for kids. and the movie falls flat.

Taking place 3 years after the original, this film did have some high expectations to live up too. The humour as well as the strong female characters involved created something with little to complain about. Sexist jokes such as 'Woman are about as good at a coppella as they are at being doctors' said by John (John Michael Higgins) to then be put down by such comments like 'crack a Book, John' said by Gail (Elizabeth Banks), is displaying woman power. The film did a good job at not living up to the hype, with many critics dubbing the film to be better than the first. But like we all know, films with hype generally don't live up to expectations, turning a film from a success to a shamble in weeks. Thanks to many of the original cast reigniting their roles in this film, it meant for a quick and easy introduction, with all the characters already built and back stories set. \n\nBeca (Anna Kendrick) has worked her way up from the first film, with her natural and powerful singing ability; we see her rise from the new comer in the original to the leader in Pitch Perfect 2. We see her leadership and her desire to achieving her real goal in life, whilst being the figurehead for all of the other girls to follow. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) has recreated her role from the original in a much more humorous and creative way, being the main supplier of laughs throughout the film, from her sexual antics to her denial of love she is always throwing laughs at us, giving us the feeling of 'I wish she was my friend'. Jason Moore didn't continue his role as director in the sequel, leaving the job to Elizabeth Bank to direct and act in this hilarious sequel. Although during the end performance, there is obvious and silly CGI green screens that even the least of film nerds would be able to reorganise, granted this isn't just down to the director, but the lack of a 'Perfect' special effect expert. However you can't take away the excellent choreography and excellent screen direction that she produced, with the breath taking dancing and the powerful voices, you are fully entertained throughout each performance, if it's the plot changing performance or if its when Amy decides to serenade the man of her dreams. The film doesn't change much from the first film, with a similar plot line and the use of the same scenes during the film, like the group showdown where they have to blurt out songs without compromise for them to lose only too their main competition, showing the lack of creativity by the writers.\n\nBeca and Fat Amy both stealing the stage with their support acts Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Lilly (Hana Mea Lee) not far behind left little room for the new characters to grow, leaving characters such as Flo (Chrissie Fit) as a nameless character that you just remember as 'The New One'. Down too the fact that she wasn't a very fun character and didn't have the personality to out shines the outrageous Amy. \n\nPitch Perfect 2 starts 3 years after the original, meaning that many of the girls are in their final year of college. However Chloe (Brittany Snow) who was one of the main Barden Bella's in the first had actually been at college for 7 years, without no thought of what she was going to do after and knowing what she was even doing at college. This was a plot hole in the film that overall didn't have many, however the nature of her role in the film, you get past the fact that she is a bit of a sado who doesn't want to leave her life and go into real world.\n\nThe performances put on by the Barden Bella's where much better in this one, but it had to be because the competition was a lot better, although the plot was similar but on a larger level it still gave us lots of laughs throughout, weather it help the story or didn't. The story wasn't very strong and you could tell that the ideas where lacking throughout the film. You could always tell that they were going to bring out an amazing performance to try achieving their goal, making the film lack in excitement and emotion.\n\nWhere the film lacks in plot it makes up in humour, giving you laughs throughout the whole film, with there wacky yet clever jokes. The film has not moved on much from the original with the plot being basically the without the build-up to allow characters to grow. Although it has some flaws that with more creative writers could have been avoided, it is still a good watch to have a laugh with friends.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":150854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Music"],"datePublished":"2015-05-15","keywords":"f rated,sequel,a cappella,reference to philippines,triple f rated","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Global Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1579003417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After getting suspended from the ICCAs, the Barden Bellas must win the World Championships -- an international competition that no American team has ever won -- in order to be reinstated.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0447695/","name":"Anna Kendrick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2313103/","name":"Rebel Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006969/","name":"Elizabeth Banks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283926/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0134224/","name":"Kay Cannon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3015467/","name":"Mickey Rapkin"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Taking place 3 years after the original, this film did have some high expectations to live up too. The humour as well as the strong female characters involved created something with little to complain about. Sexist jokes such as 'Woman are about as good at a coppella as they are at being doctors' said by John (John Michael Higgins) to then be put down by such comments like 'crack a Book, John' said by Gail (Elizabeth Banks), is displaying woman power. The film did a good job at not living up to the hype, with many critics dubbing the film to be better than the first. But like we all know, films with hype generally don't live up to expectations, turning a film from a success to a shamble in weeks. Thanks to many of the original cast reigniting their roles in this film, it meant for a quick and easy introduction, with all the characters already built and back stories set. \n\nBeca (Anna Kendrick) has worked her way up from the first film, with her natural and powerful singing ability; we see her rise from the new comer in the original to the leader in Pitch Perfect 2. We see her leadership and her desire to achieving her real goal in life, whilst being the figurehead for all of the other girls to follow. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) has recreated her role from the original in a much more humorous and creative way, being the main supplier of laughs throughout the film, from her sexual antics to her denial of love she is always throwing laughs at us, giving us the feeling of 'I wish she was my friend'. Jason Moore didn't continue his role as director in the sequel, leaving the job to Elizabeth Bank to direct and act in this hilarious sequel. Although during the end performance, there is obvious and silly CGI green screens that even the least of film nerds would be able to reorganise, granted this isn't just down to the director, but the lack of a 'Perfect' special effect expert. However you can't take away the excellent choreography and excellent screen direction that she produced, with the breath taking dancing and the powerful voices, you are fully entertained throughout each performance, if it's the plot changing performance or if its when Amy decides to serenade the man of her dreams. The film doesn't change much from the first film, with a similar plot line and the use of the same scenes during the film, like the group showdown where they have to blurt out songs without compromise for them to lose only too their main competition, showing the lack of creativity by the writers.\n\nBeca and Fat Amy both stealing the stage with their support acts Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Lilly (Hana Mea Lee) not far behind left little room for the new characters to grow, leaving characters such as Flo (Chrissie Fit) as a nameless character that you just remember as 'The New One'. Down too the fact that she wasn't a very fun character and didn't have the personality to out shines the outrageous Amy. \n\nPitch Perfect 2 starts 3 years after the original, meaning that many of the girls are in their final year of college. However Chloe (Brittany Snow) who was one of the main Barden Bella's in the first had actually been at college for 7 years, without no thought of what she was going to do after and knowing what she was even doing at college. This was a plot hole in the film that overall didn't have many, however the nature of her role in the film, you get past the fact that she is a bit of a sado who doesn't want to leave her life and go into real world.\n\nThe performances put on by the Barden Bella's where much better in this one, but it had to be because the competition was a lot better, although the plot was similar but on a larger level it still gave us lots of laughs throughout, weather it help the story or didn't. The story wasn't very strong and you could tell that the ideas where lacking throughout the film. You could always tell that they were going to bring out an amazing performance to try achieving their goal, making the film lack in excitement and emotion.\n\nWhere the film lacks in plot it makes up in humour, giving you laughs throughout the whole film, with there wacky yet clever jokes. The film has not moved on much from the original with the plot being basically the without the build-up to allow characters to grow. Although it has some flaws that with more creative writers could have been avoided, it is still a good watch to have a laugh with friends.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":150854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Music"],"datePublished":"2015-05-15","keywords":"f rated,sequel,a cappella,reference to philippines,triple f rated","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Global Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1579003417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After getting suspended from the ICCAs, the Barden Bellas must win the World Championships -- an international competition that no American team has ever won -- in order to be reinstated.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0447695/","name":"Anna Kendrick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2313103/","name":"Rebel Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006969/","name":"Elizabeth Banks"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283926/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0134224/","name":"Kay Cannon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3015467/","name":"Mickey Rapkin"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To me, that was pretty cool knowing that a film can get kids in a theater clapping for the characters on the screen.\n\nSo relax. chill.. bring your little ones... and enjoy...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-12-23","keywords":"battle of the bands,american football,chipmunk,school,singing animal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel -- Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi441844249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzYzMDQ5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkzMzg4Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzYzMDQ5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkzMzg4Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Alvin, Simon and Theodore must put aside music superstardom and return to school, where they look to win a $25,000 prize in a battle of the bands contest in order to save their school's music program.

Alvin, Sajmon i Teodor najzad sreću svoju konkurenciju - i možda nešto više od toga - u novopridošlom ženskom triju, Veveričicama. Alvinu i previše prija njegova uloga vođe grupe, a zbog njegovih ludorija na dobrotvornom koncertu Dejv Sevil završava u bolnici. Na žaljenje Alvina i njegove braće, Dejv im naređuje da privremeno napuste svoj život pop superzvezda i upišu se u školu.</desc>

I didn't actually see "Mickey Blue Eyes" until 2006, and by then, I knew it wasn't the most highly acclaimed comedy of all time, so I wasn't expecting to be blown away. However, I was hoping for at least a moderately funny spoof movie, and from what I remember, that was what I got. About 2 ½ years later, I've seen it a second time, and while I was still entertained by a good chunk of the film, it may not have been quite the same as before.\n\nMichael Felgate is an art auctioneer from England who currently resides in New York, and is dating a teacher named Gina Vitale. He wants to marry her, but doesn't know about her family! She has relatives, including her father, Frank Vitale, who are members of the Mafia, and this is why she turns down Michael's proposal, as she is afraid that if they marry, he will be lured into the world of organized crime! Michael promises not to let that happen, but this is easier said than done! After they are engaged, Michael finds himself involved in a money laundering, and finds himself questioned by suspicious FBI agents, but he must play along with this scheme in order to survive! It gets worse when Gina accidentally kills the son of a mob boss, and Michael decides to take the blame! \n\nThe first scene in the film that stands out as really funny to me is the one where the owner of a Chinese restaurant stands at the table where Michael and Gina are sitting, and makes sure Gina eats her fortune cookie. For quite a while, the film goes fairly steadily, sometimes mildly amusing, and sometimes more than that. Another major comic highlight I can't forget is Michael having to pose as a gangster known as "Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes" and having to try and speak with a New York Italian accent! The humour is not enough to carry the film, but there is also suspense, which definitely helps.

I didn't actually see "Mickey Blue Eyes" until 2006, and by then, I knew it wasn't the most highly acclaimed comedy of all time, so I wasn't expecting to be blown away. However, I was hoping for at least a moderately funny spoof movie, and from what I remember, that was what I got. About 2 ½ years later, I've seen it a second time, and while I was still entertained by a good chunk of the film, it may not have been quite the same as before.\n\nMichael Felgate is an art auctioneer from England who currently resides in New York, and is dating a teacher named Gina Vitale. He wants to marry her, but doesn't know about her family! She has relatives, including her father, Frank Vitale, who are members of the Mafia, and this is why she turns down Michael's proposal, as she is afraid that if they marry, he will be lured into the world of organized crime! Michael promises not to let that happen, but this is easier said than done! After they are engaged, Michael finds himself involved in a money laundering, and finds himself questioned by suspicious FBI agents, but he must play along with this scheme in order to survive! It gets worse when Gina accidentally kills the son of a mob boss, and Michael decides to take the blame! \n\nThe first scene in the film that stands out as really funny to me is the one where the owner of a Chinese restaurant stands at the table where Michael and Gina are sitting, and makes sure Gina eats her fortune cookie. For quite a while, the film goes fairly steadily, sometimes mildly amusing, and sometimes more than that. Another major comic highlight I can't forget is Michael having to pose as a gangster known as "Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes" and having to try and speak with a New York Italian accent! The humour is not enough to carry the film, but there is also suspense, which definitely helps. For probably most of the film, it looked like my second viewing would be like my first, but I found that it started to lose its charm towards the end, I'm not sure why, but I was not left fully satisfied. Anyway, I would say this movie certainly doesn't fail miserably as a comedy, but as such, it certainly could have been funnier, though the story and suspense often makes up for that. There are much worse comedies out there, but I can see why "Mickey Blue Eyes" isn't as popular as "Analyze This", a mob spoof which came out the same year.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36202,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"1999-08-20","keywords":"mafia,character name as title,nickname as title,movie flop,fbi federal bureau of investigation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi369212953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4ODc1NWEtYWQ2ZC00YjczLThlMmEtZGFjOWE5ZjU3MzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4ODc1NWEtYWQ2ZC00YjczLThlMmEtZGFjOWE5ZjU3MzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000675/","name":"Jeanne Tripplehorn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538614/","name":"Kelly Makin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331956/","name":"Carl Gottlieb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033739/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770649/","name":"Adam Scheinman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002675/","name":"Robert Kuhn"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I like the way the film lives in two worlds and comes together. The special effects are pretty good and while there is violence there is little gore. This is a horror film with good production values and Ms. Kuriyama plays Yuko very well, very likable and sensible. If you like horror, especially J horror, you will like this film.

The story is actually quite limited, but M. Pollock and his wife both make an interesting pair of monsters and a frighteningly believable couple, and the movie's four-handed structure pits them nicely against the model pairing of the hero and his wife. Ultimately, it might have been better had the lemmings of the title seemed more connected to the meat of the story; but the acting is good, even if the hero is just a little too reserved for us to really feel his angst.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5106,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-05-11","keywords":"volkswagen beetle,suburb,lemming,suicide,murder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524217/","name":"Laurent Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001250/","name":"Charlotte Gainsbourg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001648/","name":"Charlotte Rampling"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0596962/","name":"Dominik Moll"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057624/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0545382/","name":"Gilles Marchand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0596962/","name":"Dominik Moll"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by "The Count of Monte Cristo," Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.\n\nThe film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of "The 47 Ronin." The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.\n\nVery gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.\n\nIt is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.\n\nThe psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure.

This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by "The Count of Monte Cristo," Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.\n\nThe film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of "The 47 Ronin." The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.\n\nVery gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.\n\nIt is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.\n\nThe psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like "Downfall (Der Untergang)," it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.\n\nThe repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.\n\nThe over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1962-09-16","keywords":"samurai,suicide,poverty,revenge,one against many","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619938/","name":"Tatsuya Nakadai","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410968/","name":"Akira Ishihama","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412615/","name":"Shima Iwashita"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462030/","name":"Masaki Kobayashi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007001/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847668/","name":"Yasuhiko Takiguchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368074/","name":"Shinobu Hashimoto"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Mirno stanje u zemlji uzrok je raspada brojnih ratničkih klanova, zbog čega mnogo samuraja ostaje bez posla i pada u siromaštvo. Međutim, po kodeksu samurajskog ponašanja oni se u takvoj situaciji trebaju odlučiti za ritualno samoubistvo zvano sepuku ili harakiri, koje se ritualno izvršava na posedu bogatih vlastelina. Jedan od samuraja, Hanširo Cugumo (T. Nakadai), traži dopuštenje ohologa feudalca da se ubije. Tamo on sazna za sudbinu svojeg zeta Motomea Čijive (A. Išihama), mladog samuraja koji je tražio posao u kući, ali umesto da ga prihvate, bio je prisiljen izvršiti harakiri na mučki način. Cugumo planira osvetu kući...</desc>

Diamonds are cold, hard, many faceted and beautiful. Catherine Deneuve is the star here.  I rest my case.  There is, of course, more to it than that but not a lot more.

Used to a diet of direct-to-drive-in films they had no conception of what could happen when Hollywood threw big bucks and a competent (if distracted) director at the genre. What they got was something that movie historians are still trying to classify. A movie based on a CB radio song that morphed into a poetic homage to machinery; where trucks are turned into mythological monsters and filmed cruising through the heat-radiating desert to a score of classical music.\n\nWhy Sam Peckinpah elected to take on this project has really never been explained, although that decision certainly supports those tales of substance abuse, and the final cut is bizarre enough to also fit that explanation. It is an amazing film as it wobbles between self-parody and self-importance to a degree never seen before and never seen again until "Apocalypse Now". I'm not sure how much attention and interest Peckinpah actually showed toward the making of "Convoy". It has the disjointed feel of multiple directors or of a Director of Photography filling in many times when Sam was not motivated to make an appearance on the set.\n\nKris Kristofferson is fine as trucker "Rubber Duck" although Earnest Borgnine pretty much steals the whole thing.\n\nBut "Convoy's real claim to fame is as the film where Ali MacGraw's career spectacularly crashed and burned. She did not just fade away but shattered into a million pieces. MacGraw got into acting in her late twenties but looked young enough to be believable as a college-age girl in her first two starring roles; the excellent "Goodbye Columbus" and the pathetic but hugely popular "Love Story". Her age worked to her advantage as her two characters (particularly "Goodbye's" Brenda) came off as poised, stylish, classy and smart. She picked up a huge following of male viewers who would have bought tickets to anything she was in and she was generally inoffensive to female viewers. She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar, started fashion crazes, and made the cover of Time magazine. She also picked up the head of Paramount Studios (Robert Evans) as a husband dedicated to advancing her acting career. It was a done deal that she would get the lead in "Chinatown", a role that would fit her rather limited range (poised, classy, stylish). Her only obstacle was managing the transition to middle age in a way that her smitten fans could accept.\n\nUnfortunately she dumped Evans for a short marriage (5 years) to Steve McQueen. Just how badly her image and career were managed after she left Evans is illustrated by her bad haircut in "Convoy". Just glance at the promotional poster and you may be able to hear the sounds of a million bubbles bursting in the minds of her male fans. The idea of "Brenda" playing a truck stop mama with short curly hair would have made it too painful to even contemplate seeing this movie. Her fan base literally melted away with the start of the film's promotion campaign. They never returned, the illusion had died. Ironically had they actually seen her horrible performance in "Convoy" they might have felt better, as the performance is so absurd it achieves a sort of surreal quality. But a couple years later they discovered replacement Jennifer Beals and moved on.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16292,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"1978-08-24","keywords":"truck driver,arizona desert,police corruption,18 wheeler,convoy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2362097945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMwZTdiNTEtNjZlYy00NjBiLTlkYzYtMTBmNzRlMDE5MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMwZTdiNTEtNjZlYy00NjBiLTlkYzYtMTBmNzRlMDE5MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Truckers form a mile long "convoy" in support of a trucker's vendetta with an abusive sheriff...Based on the country song of same title by C.W.

Just how badly her image and career were managed after she left Evans is illustrated by her bad haircut in "Convoy". Just glance at the promotional poster and you may be able to hear the sounds of a million bubbles bursting in the minds of her male fans. The idea of "Brenda" playing a truck stop mama with short curly hair would have made it too painful to even contemplate seeing this movie. Her fan base literally melted away with the start of the film's promotion campaign. They never returned, the illusion had died. Ironically had they actually seen her horrible performance in "Convoy" they might have felt better, as the performance is so absurd it achieves a sort of surreal quality. But a couple years later they discovered replacement Jennifer Beals and moved on.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16292,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"1978-08-24","keywords":"truck driver,arizona desert,police corruption,18 wheeler,convoy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2362097945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMwZTdiNTEtNjZlYy00NjBiLTlkYzYtMTBmNzRlMDE5MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMwZTdiNTEtNjZlYy00NjBiLTlkYzYtMTBmNzRlMDE5MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Truckers form a mile long "convoy" in support of a trucker's vendetta with an abusive sheriff...Based on the country song of same title by C.W.

S. Marine rifle company led by a man named "Sergeant John M. Stryker" (John Wayne). As it so happens, having experienced combat firsthand he is extremely determined to train and fine-tune his company into being as capable and ready as possible. Needless to say, his hardline approach is not welcomed by everyone in the company with one particular person named "Al Thomas" (Forrest Tucker) having had a personal quarrel with him in a previous assignment. Additionally, another man by the name of "Robert Dunne" (Arthur Franz) also has a dislike for him but for an entirely different reason. Yet even so, Sgt Stryker realizes that he cannot let their personal animosity deter him from his mission-especially since they are bound to see ferocious combat in the very near future. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I found this to be a pretty good World War II picture due in large part to the serious plot and the acting of John Wayne who essentially carried this film. That being said, I recommend this film for those interested and have rated it accordingly.

S. Marine rifle company led by a man named "Sergeant John M. Stryker" (John Wayne). As it so happens, having experienced combat firsthand he is extremely determined to train and fine-tune his company into being as capable and ready as possible. Needless to say, his hardline approach is not welcomed by everyone in the company with one particular person named "Al Thomas" (Forrest Tucker) having had a personal quarrel with him in a previous assignment. Additionally, another man by the name of "Robert Dunne" (Arthur Franz) also has a dislike for him but for an entirely different reason. Yet even so, Sgt Stryker realizes that he cannot let their personal animosity deter him from his mission-especially since they are bound to see ferocious combat in the very near future. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I found this to be a pretty good World War II picture due in large part to the serious plot and the acting of John Wayne who essentially carried this film. That being said, I recommend this film for those interested and have rated it accordingly. Above average.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Action","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1950-03-01","keywords":"pacific war,gunfire,man shot to death,main character dies,military operation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sands of Iwo Jima","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi276889881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJlYTQ3NjgtMzU0ZC00ZGJmLTgwYjUtODFjYjYyNmQ2ZmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJlYTQ3NjgtMzU0ZC00ZGJmLTgwYjUtODFjYjYyNmQ2ZmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Republic Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000078/","name":"John Wayne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000730/","name":"John Agar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0544711/","name":"Adele Mara"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245385/","name":"Allan Dwan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020540/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0113689/","name":"Harry Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335455/","name":"James Edward Grant"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131237,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1960-11-17","keywords":"gladiator,slave rebellion,roman republic,roman empire,slave revolt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1415363353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljYjRlOWEtNzgxYS00M2JiLTkxNmEtYzNkOTI0Y2RkMGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljYjRlOWEtNzgxYS00M2JiLTkxNmEtYzNkOTI0Y2RkMGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000059/","name":"Laurence Olivier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001739/","name":"Jean Simmons"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000040/","name":"Stanley Kubrick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068126/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874308/","name":"Dalton Trumbo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268779/","name":"Howard Fast"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001811/","name":"Peter Ustinov"}],"duration":"PT3H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

S. Marine rifle company led by a man named "Sergeant John M. Stryker" (John Wayne). As it so happens, having experienced combat firsthand he is extremely determined to train and fine-tune his company into being as capable and ready as possible. Needless to say, his hardline approach is not welcomed by everyone in the company with one particular person named "Al Thomas" (Forrest Tucker) having had a personal quarrel with him in a previous assignment. Additionally, another man by the name of "Robert Dunne" (Arthur Franz) also has a dislike for him but for an entirely different reason. Yet even so, Sgt Stryker realizes that he cannot let their personal animosity deter him from his mission-especially since they are bound to see ferocious combat in the very near future. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I found this to be a pretty good World War II picture due in large part to the serious plot and the acting of John Wayne who essentially carried this film. That being said, I recommend this film for those interested and have rated it accordingly.

S. Marine rifle company led by a man named "Sergeant John M. Stryker" (John Wayne). As it so happens, having experienced combat firsthand he is extremely determined to train and fine-tune his company into being as capable and ready as possible. Needless to say, his hardline approach is not welcomed by everyone in the company with one particular person named "Al Thomas" (Forrest Tucker) having had a personal quarrel with him in a previous assignment. Additionally, another man by the name of "Robert Dunne" (Arthur Franz) also has a dislike for him but for an entirely different reason. Yet even so, Sgt Stryker realizes that he cannot let their personal animosity deter him from his mission-especially since they are bound to see ferocious combat in the very near future. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I found this to be a pretty good World War II picture due in large part to the serious plot and the acting of John Wayne who essentially carried this film. That being said, I recommend this film for those interested and have rated it accordingly. Above average.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Action","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1950-03-01","keywords":"pacific war,gunfire,man shot to death,main character dies,military operation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sands of Iwo Jima","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi276889881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJlYTQ3NjgtMzU0ZC00ZGJmLTgwYjUtODFjYjYyNmQ2ZmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJlYTQ3NjgtMzU0ZC00ZGJmLTgwYjUtODFjYjYyNmQ2ZmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Republic Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000078/","name":"John Wayne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000730/","name":"John Agar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0544711/","name":"Adele Mara"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245385/","name":"Allan Dwan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020540/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0113689/","name":"Harry Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335455/","name":"James Edward Grant"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.\n\nBut you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.\n\nShooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.\n\nLater, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. \n\nBut SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131237,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1960-11-17","keywords":"gladiator,slave rebellion,roman republic,roman empire,slave revolt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1415363353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljYjRlOWEtNzgxYS00M2JiLTkxNmEtYzNkOTI0Y2RkMGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljYjRlOWEtNzgxYS00M2JiLTkxNmEtYzNkOTI0Y2RkMGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000059/","name":"Laurence Olivier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001739/","name":"Jean Simmons"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000040/","name":"Stanley Kubrick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068126/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874308/","name":"Dalton Trumbo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268779/","name":"Howard Fast"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001811/","name":"Peter Ustinov"}],"duration":"PT3H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Paul is called upon to solve the strange rape &amp; murder of the title character, Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson). Paul gets paired with a rape investigator named Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe), who just happens to be a former flame of his. As Paul and Sara work the clues, they discover a string of characters who all have their secrets to hide. And it becomes apparent that the Army's main concern is keeping things quiet and maintaining the public image.\n\nWhile far from a great story, this is still an absorbing one. There's a very tragic and somber arc that stems from the Elizabeth Campbell character being a *very* troubled individual. The story isn't always too believable, but director Simon West keeps the plot progressing in competent enough fashion, with a couple of twists along the way. The more serious and sordid elements are sometimes contrasted with not terribly amusing banter between Travolta and Stowe.\n\nThe exemplary supporting cast is the main reason to watch. Travolta lays on the goofy charm a bit much at first (and does a deliberately bad Southern accent for too long a time), but as the movie goes on, the better his performance gets. He and Stowe are able to create some chemistry. Stefanson is effective as the victim, and James Cromwell as her general father is completely convincing. Clarence Williams III also scores strongly as the generals' comrade, who's loyal to the core. The real standout is the always dynamic James Woods, as Elizabeths' mentor; the scenes where he and Travolta are attempting to outwit each other are just about the best in the movie.\n\nWell shot (by Peter Menzies Jr.) and decently paced, "The General's Daughter" manages to be watchable for a little under two hours.\n\nSeven out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-10-06","keywords":"army,cover up,murder,rape,military","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The General's Daughter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1508549657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZhZDJiODEtNDBjNC00NTUxLWE1ZWMtMGQ3N2IxYzkzZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZhZDJiODEtNDBjNC00NTUxLWE1ZWMtMGQ3N2IxYzkzZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The General's Daughter"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000656/","name":"Madeleine Stowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000342/","name":"James Cromwell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922346/","name":"Simon West"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075914/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067370/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218491/","name":"Nelson DeMille"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078203/","name":"Christopher Bertolini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001279/","name":"William Goldman"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Paul is called upon to solve the strange rape &amp; murder of the title character, Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson). Paul gets paired with a rape investigator named Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe), who just happens to be a former flame of his. As Paul and Sara work the clues, they discover a string of characters who all have their secrets to hide. And it becomes apparent that the Army's main concern is keeping things quiet and maintaining the public image.\n\nWhile far from a great story, this is still an absorbing one. There's a very tragic and somber arc that stems from the Elizabeth Campbell character being a *very* troubled individual. The story isn't always too believable, but director Simon West keeps the plot progressing in competent enough fashion, with a couple of twists along the way. The more serious and sordid elements are sometimes contrasted with not terribly amusing banter between Travolta and Stowe.\n\nThe exemplary supporting cast is the main reason to watch. Travolta lays on the goofy charm a bit much at first (and does a deliberately bad Southern accent for too long a time), but as the movie goes on, the better his performance gets. He and Stowe are able to create some chemistry. Stefanson is effective as the victim, and James Cromwell as her general father is completely convincing. Clarence Williams III also scores strongly as the generals' comrade, who's loyal to the core. The real standout is the always dynamic James Woods, as Elizabeths' mentor; the scenes where he and Travolta are attempting to outwit each other are just about the best in the movie.\n\nWell shot (by Peter Menzies Jr.) and decently paced, "The General's Daughter" manages to be watchable for a little under two hours.\n\nSeven out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-10-06","keywords":"army,cover up,murder,rape,military","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The General's Daughter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1508549657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZhZDJiODEtNDBjNC00NTUxLWE1ZWMtMGQ3N2IxYzkzZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZhZDJiODEtNDBjNC00NTUxLWE1ZWMtMGQ3N2IxYzkzZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The General's Daughter","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000656/","name":"Madeleine Stowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000342/","name":"James Cromwell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922346/","name":"Simon West"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075914/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067370/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218491/","name":"Nelson DeMille","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078203/","name":"Christopher Bertolini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001279/","name":"William Goldman"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The dive footage of the sharks would have made for an interesting documentary on apex predators; the story ought just to have been shredded at birth...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8775,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-04-12","keywords":"shark,jelly fish,touching a shark,can of beer,spear gun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Premiere","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2116264217","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODQ2NDgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5ODgzNw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODQ2NDgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5ODgzNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the exclusive trailer premiere for the new thriller starring Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez, available via video on demand 3/8 and in theaters 3/30.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000932/","name":"Halle Berry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0553648/","name":"Olivier Martinez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0114460/","name":"Ralph Brown"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007082/","name":"John Stockwell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0295380/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0291625/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0345025/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3602980/","name":"Amy Sorlie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159892/","name":"Ronnie Christensen"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Having lived through the times myself was aware of the background to the movie, but unaware of the specific story that it explores.\n\nKeira Knightly plays Katharine Gun who works at GCHQ collecting intelligence for the UK. She is concerned about the accuracy of the intelligence that is being used to prove the case for war. The British and American government need a resolution passing at the United Nations to legitimize the war. A memo is distributed to collect intelligence on the United Nations members that can be used to coax them into voting for the resolution. She is shocked by this and wants to stop the war.\n\nIn the same way that Brexit dominates British news at the moment WMD's dominated the next back then. The movie is good and shows the pressure that everybody is under.

Having lived through the times myself was aware of the background to the movie, but unaware of the specific story that it explores.\n\nKeira Knightly plays Katharine Gun who works at GCHQ collecting intelligence for the UK. She is concerned about the accuracy of the intelligence that is being used to prove the case for war. The British and American government need a resolution passing at the United Nations to legitimize the war. A memo is distributed to collect intelligence on the United Nations members that can be used to coax them into voting for the resolution. She is shocked by this and wants to stop the war.\n\nIn the same way that Brexit dominates British news at the moment WMD's dominated the next back then. The movie is good and shows the pressure that everybody is under. You get the chance to wonder whether you would make the same decisions as Katharine and whether she was right to do it.\n\nI've never been a big fan of Knightly, but she does a fine job in Official Secrets.

One way or another Steven has a plan, a plan to murder his own wife....with a little help from the someone else.\n\nI really love this movie. I try to watch it as much as possible. In this movie it is set to the level of Micheal Douglas's creepy and insanity side of his acting. He scared me so much that I didn't feel comfortable about seeing this for the first time. Gwenyth Paltrow on the other hand, plays a very innocent and lovely role. She really doesn't have a clue what Steven and David are up to in this twisting thriller. Viggo is absolutely excellent in this movie. He gave an outstanding role and put another character on my favorite list. This is a very good movie and I recommend this movie to Alfred Hitchcock and mystery/murder fans.

Creative, artsy, and many cliffhangers","reviewBody":"Micheal Douglas (Steven) and Gwenyth Paltrow (Emily) are a married couple. Emily falls in love and has an affair with a young painter, David Shaw (Mortensen). Hiding the affair and making a tense move, Emily is put in the position to tell Steven or not. One way or another Steven has a plan, a plan to murder his own wife....with a little help from the someone else.\n\nI really love this movie. I try to watch it as much as possible. In this movie it is set to the level of Micheal Douglas's creepy and insanity side of his acting. He scared me so much that I didn't feel comfortable about seeing this for the first time. Gwenyth Paltrow on the other hand, plays a very innocent and lovely role. She really doesn't have a clue what Steven and David are up to in this twisting thriller. Viggo is absolutely excellent in this movie. He gave an outstanding role and put another character on my favorite list. This is a very good movie and I recommend this movie to Alfred Hitchcock and mystery/murder fans. I would rate this 10/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":83316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1998-06-05","keywords":"woman in jeopardy,urban setting,cell phone,murder,woman murders attacker","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Perfect Murder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2813591833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE1YmE1MTEtOTU5MC00NmMxLWJlMTUtMTdkZTgxYTcyOTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE1YmE1MTEtOTU5MC00NmMxLWJlMTUtMTdkZTgxYTcyOTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001112/","name":"Andrew Davis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044240/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461425/","name":"Frederick Knott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446761/","name":"Patrick Smith Kelly"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A Most Violent Year is a strong, character-driven drama that's lifted infinitely by terrific lead performances by Oscar Isaacs and Jessica Chastain, inflating what could have been a tiresome, trite look at one man versus the world in an unkind city.\n\nAbel Morales (Isaac) runs Standard Oil, and he has his eyes on some prime waterfront real estate. With this land, he'll be able to fill his trucks from directly from the oil barges on the river, rather than have the oil transported from boat to someone else's trucks and then to his warehouses. And by saving money there, he'll be able to buy a little more oil than he normally would, keep it on the premises, and then sell it to customers or competitors when demand rises. He makes a deal for the land with a sizable down payment and the stipulation that the balance be tendered within 30 days - no extensions allowed. This, of course, is before Abel's company comes under investigation by an intrepid detective (David Oyelowo), his trucks get highjacked and the oil stolen, and his backers start to, well, back away.\n\nBut Abel is no wilting flower, whether he's dealing with the fuzz or the other oilmen in the city. He has his convictions, and damned if he's going to give them up to appease anyone. Which, as you might suspect, makes things a little more difficult. His wife Anna (Chastain), who can match Abel in sheer willpower, is also fiercely protective of her husband, her business (she's the bookkeeper), and her family. Sort of a two-pronged attack. Abel's charm and style nets him both friends and enemies, but this isn't yet another mobster movie by any means. In fact, the only direct evidence of organized crime in the movie centers around Abel's competition - men who would do anything to maintain and/or increase their share of the lucrative oil business in the city.\n\nBoth Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. Theirs is not a one-sided relationship. Abel is not some power-mad, bombastic husband who treats the wife and kids as either baggage or items to be used for fun and profit. Anna is not some melodramatic, over-spirited harpy who resents her husband's work obsession. They work together even when they disagree. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention an almost unrecognizable Albert Brooks, the company's astute and slightly amoral lawyer. Brooks, in what appears to be a Karl Malden wig, is a real treat.\n\nA Most Violent Year carries a strong message, and that message is this: don't count the little guy out, particularly when he (and his spouse) is whip-smart, unafraid to take chances, and endlessly resourceful. High praise indeed for director J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost) and his talented cast.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"new york city,american dream,oil,year 1981,immigrant","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi891727641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City 1981, an ambitious immigrant fights to protect his business and family during the most dangerous year in the city's history.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1567113/","name":"Jessica Chastain"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654648/","name":"David Oyelowo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1170855/","name":"J.C.

A Most Violent Year is a strong, character-driven drama that's lifted infinitely by terrific lead performances by Oscar Isaacs and Jessica Chastain, inflating what could have been a tiresome, trite look at one man versus the world in an unkind city.\n\nAbel Morales (Isaac) runs Standard Oil, and he has his eyes on some prime waterfront real estate. With this land, he'll be able to fill his trucks from directly from the oil barges on the river, rather than have the oil transported from boat to someone else's trucks and then to his warehouses. And by saving money there, he'll be able to buy a little more oil than he normally would, keep it on the premises, and then sell it to customers or competitors when demand rises. He makes a deal for the land with a sizable down payment and the stipulation that the balance be tendered within 30 days - no extensions allowed. This, of course, is before Abel's company comes under investigation by an intrepid detective (David Oyelowo), his trucks get highjacked and the oil stolen, and his backers start to, well, back away.\n\nBut Abel is no wilting flower, whether he's dealing with the fuzz or the other oilmen in the city. He has his convictions, and damned if he's going to give them up to appease anyone. Which, as you might suspect, makes things a little more difficult. His wife Anna (Chastain), who can match Abel in sheer willpower, is also fiercely protective of her husband, her business (she's the bookkeeper), and her family. Sort of a two-pronged attack. Abel's charm and style nets him both friends and enemies, but this isn't yet another mobster movie by any means. In fact, the only direct evidence of organized crime in the movie centers around Abel's competition - men who would do anything to maintain and/or increase their share of the lucrative oil business in the city.\n\nBoth Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. Theirs is not a one-sided relationship. Abel is not some power-mad, bombastic husband who treats the wife and kids as either baggage or items to be used for fun and profit. Anna is not some melodramatic, over-spirited harpy who resents her husband's work obsession. They work together even when they disagree. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention an almost unrecognizable Albert Brooks, the company's astute and slightly amoral lawyer. Brooks, in what appears to be a Karl Malden wig, is a real treat.\n\nA Most Violent Year carries a strong message, and that message is this: don't count the little guy out, particularly when he (and his spouse) is whip-smart, unafraid to take chances, and endlessly resourceful. High praise indeed for director J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost) and his talented cast.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"new york city,american dream,oil,year 1981,immigrant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi891727641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City 1981, an ambitious immigrant fights to protect his business and family during the most dangerous year in the city's history.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1567113/","name":"Jessica Chastain","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654648/","name":"David Oyelowo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1170855/","name":"J.C.

It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that "You are there!" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in  the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the "good life" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":224397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-07-19","keywords":"advertising,chain smoking,1960s,new york,drinking","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358316/","name":"Jon Hamm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440229/","name":"Vincent Kartheiser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247554/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019701/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1980806/","name":"Matthew Weiner"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi69710105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a trailer for AMC's "Mad Men.""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The Good Doctor" je američka, medicinska, dramska serija u kojoj je glavni lik neobični, mladi hirurg Šon Marfi, autistični genije koji sve posmatra drugačije od ostalih i koji se iz rodnog Vajominga seli u San Hoze kako bi se zaposlio u prestižnoj bolnici Svetog Bonaventure. Uprkos tome što nema socijalne veštine i ne snalazi se u međuljudskim odnosima i nepoznati su mu pojmovi poput sreće i ljubavi, on je neverovatan stručnjak. Doktor Šon je izuzetno drag i inteligentan, ali ga šef ipak uzima na zub, zbog njegovog direktnosti i nespretnog ponašanja prema pacijentima, međutim, njegova genijlanost je neosporna.</desc>

It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that "You are there!" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in  the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the "good life" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":224397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-07-19","keywords":"advertising,chain smoking,1960s,new york,drinking","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358316/","name":"Jon Hamm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440229/","name":"Vincent Kartheiser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247554/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019701/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1980806/","name":"Matthew Weiner"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi69710105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a trailer for AMC's "Mad Men.""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that "You are there!" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in  the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the "good life" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":224397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-07-19","keywords":"advertising,chain smoking,1960s,new york,drinking","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358316/","name":"Jon Hamm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440229/","name":"Vincent Kartheiser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247554/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019701/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1980806/","name":"Matthew Weiner"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi69710105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a trailer for AMC's "Mad Men.""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that "You are there!" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in  the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the "good life" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":224397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-07-19","keywords":"advertising,chain smoking,1960s,new york,drinking","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358316/","name":"Jon Hamm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440229/","name":"Vincent Kartheiser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019701/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1980806/","name":"Matthew Weiner"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi69710105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a trailer for AMC's "Mad Men.""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that "You are there!" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in  the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the "good life" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":224397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-07-19","keywords":"advertising,chain smoking,1960s,new york,drinking","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358316/","name":"Jon Hamm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440229/","name":"Vincent Kartheiser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019701/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1980806/","name":"Matthew Weiner"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi69710105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a trailer for AMC's "Mad Men.""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This theme is explored with a certain amount of graphic disgust from Cronenberg as he takes Max, exposes him to graphic television violence and sees the affect it has on his mind and his body. As a commentary on the social impact of mass media it is hardly the clearest or most accessible of things but it is interesting and engaging nonetheless.

The imaginative body horror stuff is very well done and the effects as impressive as the twisted creative forces behind it. The cast also buy into it well, even if the show does mainly belong to Woods. He is totally convincing which is a feat you need to believe is very hard to pull off in this sort of film! The rest of the cast are more in the world of the film (as opposed to drawn into it) and the result is that their performances tend to be more out and out weird  point in case Harry who is disturbingly vapid as the hollow S&amp;M thrill seeker of the piece. Likewise Smits, Carlson, Creley and others are more about the world than giving performances so-called.\n\nOverall though, this is an interesting and imaginative film. It doesn't make a lot of sense but it is enjoyable to try and apply what is happening to work out a meaning within it while watching it.

Sure, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Pinhead, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger were all instrumental in my fascination and divulgence into the horror genre - but the possessed Good Guys doll by the name of Chucky was always my favorite of the tentpole franchises.\n\nIt is hard to fathom that it was 25 years ago when Chucky was first launched into our pop culture references with Child's Play. Directed to Tom Holland on a story by Don Mancini, the 1988 horror surprised most everyone with a $35 million box office gross against a paltry $9 million budget.\n\nSequels ensued with Child's Play 2 (1990), Child's Play 3 (1991), Bride of Chucky (1998) and Seed of Chucky (2004). Through each film, the horror seemed lessened by the increasing use of black humor scattered amongst the bloodshed.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the Child's Play franchise lost its way, but it did veer off the original path. This deviation was not lost of creator Don Mancini who takes charge behind the camera for Curse of Chucky now available on VOD.\n\nIn this sixth edition of the evil doll's murderous exploits, Chucky is shipped from a police evidence lockup to a home of a young woman, Nica, confined to a wheelchair since birth. Chucky's first victim alienates the young woman and when other family and friends arrive at the house to comfort Nica, it allows for a higher body count and a night of mayhem. Nica is able to put the pieces together to eventually figure the doll at the centre of the bloodshed, but her limited mobility will be both a benefit and a hindrance on her ultimate survival.\n\nWe've come a long way since 1988 and Mancini has more digital tricks up his sleeve to bring the doll to life. Some might balk at the idea of a CGI motioned doll, but take our word for it, the added computer detail only adds to Chucky's evil looks. There are a few scenes where our villain gets to show real emotion using his rubber face and it is the technology that a lot of horror enthusiasts despise that is at the root of the improvements.\n\nMancini did go back to the roots with the story that focuses more on the development of the horror rather than the slapstick funduggery that overly consumed Bride and Seed of Chucky.

Sure, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Pinhead, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger were all instrumental in my fascination and divulgence into the horror genre - but the possessed Good Guys doll by the name of Chucky was always my favorite of the tentpole franchises.\n\nIt is hard to fathom that it was 25 years ago when Chucky was first launched into our pop culture references with Child's Play. Directed to Tom Holland on a story by Don Mancini, the 1988 horror surprised most everyone with a $35 million box office gross against a paltry $9 million budget.\n\nSequels ensued with Child's Play 2 (1990), Child's Play 3 (1991), Bride of Chucky (1998) and Seed of Chucky (2004). Through each film, the horror seemed lessened by the increasing use of black humor scattered amongst the bloodshed.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the Child's Play franchise lost its way, but it did veer off the original path. This deviation was not lost of creator Don Mancini who takes charge behind the camera for Curse of Chucky now available on VOD.\n\nIn this sixth edition of the evil doll's murderous exploits, Chucky is shipped from a police evidence lockup to a home of a young woman, Nica, confined to a wheelchair since birth. Chucky's first victim alienates the young woman and when other family and friends arrive at the house to comfort Nica, it allows for a higher body count and a night of mayhem. Nica is able to put the pieces together to eventually figure the doll at the centre of the bloodshed, but her limited mobility will be both a benefit and a hindrance on her ultimate survival.\n\nWe've come a long way since 1988 and Mancini has more digital tricks up his sleeve to bring the doll to life. Some might balk at the idea of a CGI motioned doll, but take our word for it, the added computer detail only adds to Chucky's evil looks. There are a few scenes where our villain gets to show real emotion using his rubber face and it is the technology that a lot of horror enthusiasts despise that is at the root of the improvements.\n\nMancini did go back to the roots with the story that focuses more on the development of the horror rather than the slapstick funduggery that overly consumed Bride and Seed of Chucky. Replacing much of the pop culture referencing in-jokes are some tense moments of horror and some valued kills that value quality over quantity.\n\nCurse of Chucky goes places unexpected for a fifth sequel and it betters any of the films that preceded it in the series. Chucky is meaner, nastier and more patient which allows for better horror. There are some good scares in Curse and Chucky's evil might never have been better punctuated on screen. A solid story – one with flashback ties that support Chucky's choice of family terrorizing and some after the credit scenes that tie in the rest of the series – compliments the action and sets the stage for what we hope is the continuation of the franchise.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37917,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-24","keywords":"doll,wheelchair,serial killer,murder disguised as suicide,handicapped","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3028461849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3Njc5MTczMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIzOTI4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3Njc5MTczMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIzOTI4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Chucky the killer doll returns to terrorize a family funeral.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0703336/","name":"Chantal Quesnelle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1875040/","name":"Fiona Dourif","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2849998/","name":"Jordan Gavaris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238841/","name":"Don Mancini"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238841/","name":"Don Mancini"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear.

The Punisher ended up being a much better movie than I was anticipating. I think it will please comic fans and action fans alike. I also think it will be accessible to mainstream audiences. Definitely check it out on the big screen. \n\nThe brilliance of this movie comes from the uneasy nature in which you spend your two hours riveted to the story.  Yes, I did say brilliance.  At first, you get that uneasy feeling as you watch the director set up a story which is pretty much common knowledge.  You know that Frank's wife and son are going to get it.  So, the exposition that sets up his love for his family and the tender moments they share are uneasy, sorrowful and touching.  After the Punisher revs up into full `Punishing' mode, you're uneasy at the way in which he is dispatching villain after villain.  I was squirming in my chair and I wasn't the only one in the theatre doing so.  Sure it's violent but it borders on sadistic violence.  What's makes you the most uneasy is the fact that you are actually enjoying the carnage. These guys are so vile and are so deserving of their `Punishment' but you still have guilt to go along with the pleasure of seeing Frank really cut loose.  If you've seen The Punisher trailer then you see an image of him firing an arrow.  You have NO idea where that arrow ends up but boy, that must have hurt.  The one thing you don't have to worry about with this film is if the villain will get his.  I hate movies that go so far to develop a villain as truly evil by having him do despicable things after despicable things but have his demise be quick at movies end.  Well, you will feel sorry for Travolta's character at the end of this film and he does some very horrible things himself during the duration of this movie.  Overall, this film is an emotional journey that will make you squirm.

A horribly disfigured mob boss with a vendetta is not a subtle thing to begin with.\n\nAs for the "respectable" critics' complaints: 1. Violence: Of course it's violent! What part of the title "Punisher: War Zone" implies peaceful conflict resolution? He's not the "Admonisher". The gore and violence is not at the level of a "Saw" film, but it is high. It is rated "R" for a reason.\n\n2. Dialogue: I think the critics have been spoiled by "Dark Knight" and "Iron Man". Those were comic-book movies with extraordinarily good dialogue. "Punisher: War Zone" is no worse than a "Predator" or "Rambo: First Blood". Not great, but not awful. This is not supposed to be "Hamlet".\n\n3. Script: The story moves along well, and when there's a break in the action (which isn't very often), the film doesn't drag- it's always going somewhere. Not perfect, but good. Much better than the critics have made it out to be.\n\nAll in all, a good time, and one that I'll buy and re-watch as soon as it comes out on DVD.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":62116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-17","keywords":"song during end credits,rock soundtrack,exploding body,frank castle character,the punisher character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Punisher: War Zone -- Theatrical Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi65536281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYyMTYzMjAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk2NDQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYyMTYzMjAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk2NDQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Punisher: War Zone, directed by Lexi Alexander."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829032/","name":"Ray Stevenson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922035/","name":"Dominic West"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004748/","name":"Julie Benz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591994/","name":"Lexi Alexander"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255123/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1238801/","name":"Nick Santora"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1436466/","name":"Art Marcum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0391344/","name":"Matt Holloway"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What part of the title "Punisher: War Zone" implies peaceful conflict resolution? He's not the "Admonisher". The gore and violence is not at the level of a "Saw" film, but it is high. It is rated "R" for a reason.\n\n2. Dialogue: I think the critics have been spoiled by "Dark Knight" and "Iron Man". Those were comic-book movies with extraordinarily good dialogue. "Punisher: War Zone" is no worse than a "Predator" or "Rambo: First Blood". Not great, but not awful. This is not supposed to be "Hamlet".\n\n3. Script: The story moves along well, and when there's a break in the action (which isn't very often), the film doesn't drag- it's always going somewhere. Not perfect, but good. Much better than the critics have made it out to be.\n\nAll in all, a good time, and one that I'll buy and re-watch as soon as it comes out on DVD.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":62116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-17","keywords":"song during end credits,rock soundtrack,exploding body,frank castle character,the punisher character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Punisher: War Zone -- Theatrical Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi65536281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYyMTYzMjAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk2NDQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYyMTYzMjAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk2NDQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Punisher: War Zone, directed by Lexi Alexander.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829032/","name":"Ray Stevenson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922035/","name":"Dominic West","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004748/","name":"Julie Benz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591994/","name":"Lexi Alexander"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255123/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1238801/","name":"Nick Santora","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1436466/","name":"Art Marcum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0391344/","name":"Matt Holloway"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was a reader of the comic, and am a fan of what we've seen from Marvel lately. This movie is just what I wanted, and what I expected.\n\nRay Stevenson is perfect as Frank Castle, and everyone else is at least good enough for an action movie. Dominic West is over the top as Jigsaw - which is what Jigsaw should be! A horribly disfigured mob boss with a vendetta is not a subtle thing to begin with.\n\nAs for the "respectable" critics' complaints: 1. Violence: Of course it's violent! What part of the title "Punisher: War Zone" implies peaceful conflict resolution? He's not the "Admonisher". The gore and violence is not at the level of a "Saw" film, but it is high. It is rated "R" for a reason.\n\n2. Dialogue: I think the critics have been spoiled by "Dark Knight" and "Iron Man". Those were comic-book movies with extraordinarily good dialogue.

I was a reader of the comic, and am a fan of what we've seen from Marvel lately. This movie is just what I wanted, and what I expected.\n\nRay Stevenson is perfect as Frank Castle, and everyone else is at least good enough for an action movie. Dominic West is over the top as Jigsaw - which is what Jigsaw should be! A horribly disfigured mob boss with a vendetta is not a subtle thing to begin with.\n\nAs for the "respectable" critics' complaints: 1. Violence: Of course it's violent! What part of the title "Punisher: War Zone" implies peaceful conflict resolution? He's not the "Admonisher". The gore and violence is not at the level of a "Saw" film, but it is high. It is rated "R" for a reason.\n\n2. Dialogue: I think the critics have been spoiled by "Dark Knight" and "Iron Man". Those were comic-book movies with extraordinarily good dialogue. "Punisher: War Zone" is no worse than a "Predator" or "Rambo: First Blood". Not great, but not awful. This is not supposed to be "Hamlet".\n\n3. Script: The story moves along well, and when there's a break in the action (which isn't very often), the film doesn't drag- it's always going somewhere. Not perfect, but good.

Very monotone green and not very scary.\n\nAll-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":755785,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2002-06-12","keywords":"superhero,may parker character,peter parker character,ben parker character,spiderweb","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spider-Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1497605145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDYyNzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NDk2OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDYyNzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NDk2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Spider-Man","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000353/","name":"Willem Dafoe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0228492/","name":"Steve Ditko","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the great blend of story/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the bad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better ones.

The acting is so much better than the original Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire. The new Peter Parker is 10 x's a better actor than Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the Avengers movie but the Amazing Spiderman's plot works much better to me and the story-line just seems to pulls you along effortlessly and keeps you intrigued and interested at the same time. It's the great blend of story/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the bad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better ones. I think it's most definitely better than the last two Spiderman movies and probably better than the first one but not by too much.\n\nIt is worth the price of admission to watch this movie and it would be a great movie to take your kids since their isn't anything crazy happening in this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":609397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"spider man character,spider,death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ben Affleck, the once ridiculed but now stupendous entertainer. J.K. Simmons, the distinguished actor from Whiplash. Jon Bernthal, the rising star from The Walking Dead who's a known but yet still unknown actor, and he's great by the way. John Lithgow, an actor who delivers uncanny especially when he's the villain. Bill Dubuque, who the hell is this guy, but he wrote this movie, and this appears to be his first major project besides Robert Downey Jr's The Judge. I enjoy all of these people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much more than they know. I was anticipating this movie based on all the information I just provided. I thought this movie couldn't miss. Is The Accountant a good movie? The Accountant is a good movie.\n\nThe direction of this seems rather simple, but as the story progresses, things become a bit too complicated, and maybe not for the better. \n\nI understood the main story and what was happening. The subplot of the movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit messy but yet still engaging.\n\nThe acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan Wolff is the best character he's ever played. Affleck's performance is both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but Affleck steals the show.\n\nThe violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people, he kills people, and it's not pretty.\n\nThere's a lot of jump cutting that's present here. This movie constantly jumps from the past to the present without warning, but the transitions are fluid.\n\nThe execution of the story at times feels tedious due to its consistent jump cutting, multi-layered plot, and abundance of characters.\n\nEach character gets their moment, and everyone plays a part, but it's the coincidence that brings them all together.\n\nI think this movie is trying to be more than what it is, and it succeeds. The Accountant movie has a multi-layered engaging main plot about mental illness in young children and how they cope with their situations. The secondary plot is about The Accountant doing business with the wrong people. There's another plot to this movie with J.K Simmons and his story's compelling, but it lacks conviction.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes and choreography were breathtaking. The main plot was engaging. Ben Affleck delivered the best performance of his career. Every actor played their part.

Ben Affleck, the once ridiculed but now stupendous entertainer. J.K. Simmons, the distinguished actor from Whiplash. Jon Bernthal, the rising star from The Walking Dead who's a known but yet still unknown actor, and he's great by the way. John Lithgow, an actor who delivers uncanny especially when he's the villain. Bill Dubuque, who the hell is this guy, but he wrote this movie, and this appears to be his first major project besides Robert Downey Jr's The Judge. I enjoy all of these people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much more than they know. I was anticipating this movie based on all the information I just provided. I thought this movie couldn't miss. Is The Accountant a good movie? The Accountant is a good movie.\n\nThe direction of this seems rather simple, but as the story progresses, things become a bit too complicated, and maybe not for the better. \n\nI understood the main story and what was happening. The subplot of the movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit messy but yet still engaging.\n\nThe acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan Wolff is the best character he's ever played. Affleck's performance is both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but Affleck steals the show.\n\nThe violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people, he kills people, and it's not pretty.\n\nThere's a lot of jump cutting that's present here. This movie constantly jumps from the past to the present without warning, but the transitions are fluid.\n\nThe execution of the story at times feels tedious due to its consistent jump cutting, multi-layered plot, and abundance of characters.\n\nEach character gets their moment, and everyone plays a part, but it's the coincidence that brings them all together.\n\nI think this movie is trying to be more than what it is, and it succeeds. The Accountant movie has a multi-layered engaging main plot about mental illness in young children and how they cope with their situations. The secondary plot is about The Accountant doing business with the wrong people. There's another plot to this movie with J.K Simmons and his story's compelling, but it lacks conviction.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes and choreography were breathtaking. The main plot was engaging. Ben Affleck delivered the best performance of his career. Every actor played their part. This movie suffers from sensory overload, but regardless, I believe that it will stimulate not only intellectuals but white-knuckled action junkies as well. The main plot, Ben Affleck, and the violence is ferocious.\n\nFinal Grade: A-","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":282412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-10-26","keywords":"accountant,autism,autistic child,assassin,brother brother relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433726233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjQxODgzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM4NDY1OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjQxODgzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM4NDY1OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Christian Wolff is a math savant with more affinity for numbers than people.

I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation.

Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history.

This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's "Diabolique", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later.

I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation.

But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy (Chazz Palminteri). It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.\n\nWhatever, it means that the only reason to watch this version of "Diabolique" is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hard-as-nails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.\n\nIf you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original "Diabolique", track down 1971's "Let's Scare Jessica To Death". This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's "Diabolique", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental "institution" who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area.

I enjoy all of these people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much more than they know.

The subplot of the movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit messy but yet still engaging.\n\nThe acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan Wolff is the best character he's ever played. Affleck's performance is both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but Affleck steals the show.\n\nThe violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people, he kills people, and it's not pretty.\n\nThere's a lot of jump cutting that's present here. This movie constantly jumps from the past to the present without warning, but the transitions are fluid.\n\nThe execution of the story at times feels tedious due to its consistent jump cutting, multi-layered plot, and abundance of characters.\n\nEach character gets their moment, and everyone plays a part, but it's the coincidence that brings them all together.\n\nI think this movie is trying to be more than what it is, and it succeeds. The Accountant movie has a multi-layered engaging main plot about mental illness in young children and how they cope with their situations. The secondary plot is about The Accountant doing business with the wrong people. There's another plot to this movie with J.K Simmons and his story's compelling, but it lacks conviction.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes and choreography were breathtaking. The main plot was engaging. Ben Affleck delivered the best performance of his career. Every actor played their part. This movie suffers from sensory overload, but regardless, I believe that it will stimulate not only intellectuals but white-knuckled action junkies as well.

It was (in my eyes) close to perfection (lens flares and all). So this movie had a tough up-hill battle ahead of it. I am happy to report that the writing, direction, cinematography and acting were all terrific. But it's not quite flawless.
