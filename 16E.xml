Rocky Myers and Eve Mauro are notable. Danny Trejo is his usually staple self in the short amount of screen time.\n\nCyborg X combines existing themes and tropes from sci-fi film history and pop culture. If it was 1992 this would have been a sure fire straight to video hit, the problem is that the Cyborg, Terminator and Mad Max cash-in has been worn tire thin.\n\nKing 's creative eye is evident and he manages to pull together a consistent film for the budget with the help of Myers performance.\n\nOverall, don't expect Terminator or even Cyborg, think slicker Nemesis or APEX or more recently Battle of the Damned and you won't be disappointed."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1243,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.9},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Rocky Myers and Eve Mauro are notable. Danny Trejo is his usually staple self in the short amount of screen time.\n\nCyborg X combines existing themes and tropes from sci-fi film history and pop culture. If it was 1992 this would have been a sure fire straight to video hit, the problem is that the Cyborg, Terminator and Mad Max cash-in has been worn tire thin.\n\nKing 's creative eye is evident and he manages to pull together a consistent film for the budget with the help of Myers performance.\n\nOverall, don't expect Terminator or even Cyborg, think slicker Nemesis or APEX or more recently Battle of the Damned and you won't be disappointed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1243,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.9,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm still not sure what I think of that claim, but having seen - The Bridge on the River Kwai- enough times in the past several years, I think I'm persuaded that it's at least half right.  -Kwai-, I believe, is both a "war" and "anti-war" movie, and, in my view, it succeeds admirably at both.\n\nThere is almost no element of -Kwai- that is not praise-worthy.  David Lean's direction is tight and evocative.  The cinematography is great (even though the color seems increasingly drained in film versions that I have seen).  The acting is top-notch.  I honestly believe that this is Alec Guiness's best performance, and Sessue Hayakawa is also highly sympathetic and believable.  William Holden and Jack Hawkins round out the cast nicely.\n\nThe musical score is also right on.  Simply put, -Kwai- is an excellently constructed film made by people who obviously cared a great deal about it. As a result, the viewer comes to care a great deal about it as well.\n\nClearly -Kwai- is an anti-war film.  There is no glorification here.  War is brutal, period.  It's brutality is not captured here in terms of gory carnage or senseless battles.  Instead, the psychological dimension of brutality comes across clearly.  Yet, -Kwai- also shows the resilience of the human spirit as well as its complexity.  One is left wondering if participation in World War II not only psychologically brutalized the characters played by Guiness, Hayakawa, and Holden but also if it simultaneously uplifted them.  The paradox is striking to me each time I view this film.  War can act both as a positive and negative catalyst, and it can do both of these things at the same instant.\n\nSo, is -The Bridge on the River Kwai- a war movie or an anti-war movie?  I think Lean clearly preferred the latter, but the subject matter and his approach to it may have landed somewhere in between.\n\nRegardless,  -Kwai- is a fantastic film experience and is not to be missed. It is, simply put, my very favorite film--bar none.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207912,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT2H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

War can act both as a positive and negative catalyst, and it can do both of these things at the same instant.\n\nSo, is -The Bridge on the River Kwai- a war movie or an anti-war movie?  I think Lean clearly preferred the latter, but the subject matter and his approach to it may have landed somewhere in between.\n\nRegardless,  -Kwai- is a fantastic film experience and is not to be missed. It is, simply put, my very favorite film--bar none.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207912,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT2H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even her charismatic presence and black skin tight couture can not salvage this narrative quagmire from Director and Writer Neil Marshall. Marshall was actually very effective in "The Descent". That makes what happened here even more bewildering. "Doomsday" is a mutated clone on a number of levels. Beautiful Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale of "Underworld", but is a more athletic version. The comparisons to "Underworld" are warranted-- in particular the Gothic nihilistic tone. No Vampires. Instead we have cannibalistic survivors of a deadly man-made virus. The "Doomsday" post apocalyptic world of 2033 lands as a cheap rip-off of "The Road Warrior" and "Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome". At times enduring the grotesque cinematic chaos becomes insufferable. There is a protracted scene in which one of Major Sinclair's (Mitra's) men is charred crispy and then consumed. "Doomsday" begins with a promising premise, but soon spirals out of control into the narrative abyss. This is too bad, because Mitra plays a great hero and Malcolm McDowell garners enough restraint as the compelling antagonist Kane.\n\nIn 2008 a lethal virus eradicates Scotland killing hundreds of thousands of people. The Government in a radical measure to contain and quarantine the area erects an impenetrable Wall along the British border. One of those lucky to escape during this turmoil is young Eden Sinclair. Her mother apparently sacrifices her life to save her. The young child grows into Major Sinclair (Mitra), who is now a powerful and capable warrior.\n\nIn 2033, the virus re-emerges in England; thus threatening total annihilation. However, intelligence photos of the quarantine region reveal survivors. Therefore, a cure for the virus may exist somewhere beyond the Wall. Prime Minister John Hatcher's (Alexander Siddig) national and political survival rests on finding this cure. Apparently Kane (whacked out Malcolm McDowell), who discovered the virus, may have developed an anti-virus. Hatcher tasks his security minister Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins) to assemble a military team to retrieve the cure from the quarantine region. Nelson enrolls Major Sinclair (Mitra) to lead this mission. Sinclair quickly assembles her team, and they embark on their mission to find Kane and the cure. Once behind the Wall, the mission goes amokpredictably. Turns out that Kane (McDowell) has recreated his new world as a quasi-medieval existence where only the strong survive. From this point on the mission much like the movie becomes murky and incomprehensible.\n\nEven as a straight action movie "Doomsday" is puzzling. The quick cut edits, and dark atmosphere do little in defining crisp and engaging action sequences. Mitra performs the fight scenes admirably, though I'm guessing she is not a trained martial artist. It just comes off as sloppy. Most of the cloned "Road Warrior" high speed chases are embarrassing.\n\nThe conclusion of "Doomsday" makes no sense at all. What was Neil Marshall's point? There are a bunch of silly post apocalyptic mutant zombie movies out there, and this one is really unpleasant and not all that much fun. Rhona Mitra and Malcolm McDowell are completely wasted here. And "Doomsday" was nearly a complete waste of two hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74591,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even her charismatic presence and black skin tight couture can not salvage this narrative quagmire from Director and Writer Neil Marshall. Marshall was actually very effective in "The Descent". That makes what happened here even more bewildering. "Doomsday" is a mutated clone on a number of levels. Beautiful Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale of "Underworld", but is a more athletic version. The comparisons to "Underworld" are warranted-- in particular the Gothic nihilistic tone. No Vampires. Instead we have cannibalistic survivors of a deadly man-made virus. The "Doomsday" post apocalyptic world of 2033 lands as a cheap rip-off of "The Road Warrior" and "Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome". At times enduring the grotesque cinematic chaos becomes insufferable. There is a protracted scene in which one of Major Sinclair's (Mitra's) men is charred crispy and then consumed. "Doomsday" begins with a promising premise, but soon spirals out of control into the narrative abyss. This is too bad, because Mitra plays a great hero and Malcolm McDowell garners enough restraint as the compelling antagonist Kane.\n\nIn 2008 a lethal virus eradicates Scotland killing hundreds of thousands of people.

Perhaps, but an immensely enjoyable little movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8292,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-03-30","keywords":"bride and groom figurine,hair clippers,barber shop,hair salon,bed and breakfast","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blow Dry","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2481888793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5ZjA2M2ItNWEzMi00NzZhLTllOTMtOGJlNTY1MTlkY2Y1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5ZjA2M2ItNWEzMi00NzZhLTllOTMtOGJlNTY1MTlkY2Y1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000614/","name":"Alan Rickman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001670/","name":"Natasha Richardson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0341737/","name":"Rachel Griffiths"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0106456/","name":"Paddy Breathnach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071425/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kudos to all involved. Rob Marshall has done a fine job in adapting this beloved musical to the big screen (not an easy task), and considering the fact that this is his first big-budget feature, his accomplishment is even more resounding.\n\nThe movie follows the lives of two women, living in the tough city of "Chicago" in the 1920's. Velma Kelly (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) is a sexy stage performer, who finds herself thrown into prison after a fit of rage results in the death of both her husband and her sister who have been carry on an illict affair with each other. The other lady in question is wannabe starlet Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger), a married woman, who after being seduced and duped by her devious lover, get revenge on him by shooting him dead. This act of vengeance also see's her taking a trip to prison, and it's here that a battle of one-up-man-ship commences between the two ladies, as both use whatever means at their disposal to get (a) out of jail and (b) gain the most publicity doing it. The connecting factor between Velma &amp; Roxie comes in the form of an unscrupulous high profile defense attorney Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere), who also knowing when to take advantage of an opportunity, becomes counsel for both women and their respective cases.\n\n"Chicago" is fortunate enough to have several things going for it. Aside from strong direction from Rob Marshall, the film is blessed with memorable performances from it's three leads. Catherine Zeta Jones oozes a vampish nature to her portrayal of Velma Kelly. Looking every inch the star, she commands a strong presence in the film, and appears right at home handling both the singing and dancing aspects of the role with ease and class, not to mention a high degree of sexiness. Richard Gere also plays his part in the movie with aplomb. Despite his questionable tactics and somewhat dubious nature, Gere lends a roguish charm to his character which has you walking away if not liking then at the very least admiring his character's quick skill and cunning guile. Gere is also a strong performer in the areas of singing and dancing (much to my surprise!!). However, it's Renee Zellweger who takes centre-stage in "Chicago" - and boy, does she relish every moment of it. She is without doubt, the "star performer" of this film. With sly nods to past "blonde bombshells" such as Jean Harlow &amp; Marilyn Munroe, Zellweger runs the gauntlet of high and lows that require of her character. From demure &amp; sweet, to sly &amp; munipulative, you never know what she gonna do next. And as with Zeta-Jones &amp; Gere, Zellweger also does justice when it comes to belting out a tune, or doing the hot step.\n\nOur three principals are lucky to have an equally talented supporting cast to back them up. From John C Reilly as the down-trodden husband of Roxie Hart, to Queen Latifah as the "larger-than-life"  matron of a women's prison, everyone in this film is right on the mark with their performances. Yet at the heart of any good musical, is of course the musical numbers, and in this respect "Chicago" does not disappoint.\n\nFrom the opening heat of "All That Jazz", to the saltry "When You're Good To Mama", through to the electric "Cellblock Tango", onto the wistful "Roxie", then to the playful kitsch of "Razzle Dazzle" to the all-out "Finale" featuring Velma &amp; Roxie, "Chicago" scores big-time. The choreography, costume &amp; set designs are all terrific, giving the film the look and feel it's rightly deserves.\n\nWith the high-profile success of "Moulin Rogue" in 2001, "Chicago" is likely to follow in the same footsteps, and hopefully this will continue a trend in Hollywood to bring back "the musical" - with the same love &amp; attention that has obviously gone into making "Chicago". I highly recommend this film. You're guaranteed a enjoyable &amp; entertaining night at the movies..... with a smile on your dial, a tune in your head, and a spring in your step ....... go and treat yourself ..... you know you want to......."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":219270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Kudos to all involved. Rob Marshall has done a fine job in adapting this beloved musical to the big screen (not an easy task), and considering the fact that this is his first big-budget feature, his accomplishment is even more resounding.\n\nThe movie follows the lives of two women, living in the tough city of "Chicago" in the 1920's. Velma Kelly (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) is a sexy stage performer, who finds herself thrown into prison after a fit of rage results in the death of both her husband and her sister who have been carry on an illict affair with each other. The other lady in question is wannabe starlet Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger), a married woman, who after being seduced and duped by her devious lover, get revenge on him by shooting him dead. This act of vengeance also see's her taking a trip to prison, and it's here that a battle of one-up-man-ship commences between the two ladies, as both use whatever means at their disposal to get (a) out of jail and (b) gain the most publicity doing it. The connecting factor between Velma &amp; Roxie comes in the form of an unscrupulous high profile defense attorney Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere), who also knowing when to take advantage of an opportunity, becomes counsel for both women and their respective cases.\n\n"Chicago" is fortunate enough to have several things going for it. Aside from strong direction from Rob Marshall, the film is blessed with memorable performances from it's three leads. Catherine Zeta Jones oozes a vampish nature to her portrayal of Velma Kelly. Looking every inch the star, she commands a strong presence in the film, and appears right at home handling both the singing and dancing aspects of the role with ease and class, not to mention a high degree of sexiness. Richard Gere also plays his part in the movie with aplomb. Despite his questionable tactics and somewhat dubious nature, Gere lends a roguish charm to his character which has you walking away if not liking then at the very least admiring his character's quick skill and cunning guile. Gere is also a strong performer in the areas of singing and dancing (much to my surprise!!). However, it's Renee Zellweger who takes centre-stage in "Chicago" - and boy, does she relish every moment of it. She is without doubt, the "star performer" of this film. With sly nods to past "blonde bombshells" such as Jean Harlow &amp; Marilyn Munroe, Zellweger runs the gauntlet of high and lows that require of her character. From demure &amp; sweet, to sly &amp; munipulative, you never know what she gonna do next. And as with Zeta-Jones &amp; Gere, Zellweger also does justice when it comes to belting out a tune, or doing the hot step.\n\nOur three principals are lucky to have an equally talented supporting cast to back them up. From John C Reilly as the down-trodden husband of Roxie Hart, to Queen Latifah as the "larger-than-life"  matron of a women's prison, everyone in this film is right on the mark with their performances. Yet at the heart of any good musical, is of course the musical numbers, and in this respect "Chicago" does not disappoint.\n\nFrom the opening heat of "All That Jazz", to the saltry "When You're Good To Mama", through to the electric "Cellblock Tango", onto the wistful "Roxie", then to the playful kitsch of "Razzle Dazzle" to the all-out "Finale" featuring Velma &amp; Roxie, "Chicago" scores big-time. The choreography, costume &amp; set designs are all terrific, giving the film the look and feel it's rightly deserves.\n\nWith the high-profile success of "Moulin Rogue" in 2001, "Chicago" is likely to follow in the same footsteps, and hopefully this will continue a trend in Hollywood to bring back "the musical" - with the same love &amp; attention that has obviously gone into making "Chicago". I highly recommend this film. You're guaranteed a enjoyable &amp; entertaining night at the movies..... with a smile on your dial, a tune in your head, and a spring in your step ....... go and treat yourself ..... you know you want to.......","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":219270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie was made for entertainment purposes and showed great battle scenes as like those in the days of yesteryear. It didn't claim to be a docudrama, for those who want the correct history i'm sure there's plenty of material out there for those. To me as long as it was close to the actual events of it's time, which it was, that's good enough for me. So many other movies like the latest version of "The Alamo" had a lot of correct history but also showed things that no one could really verify like Davey Crockett yelling at Santa Anna commenting how short he was and before they murdered him he warned them he was a screamer.Fact or Hollywood? Just take Augustus for what it is and enjoy this epic with great battle scenes and done in the same manner as past greats like "Ben Hur" and "Cleopatra". I think you'll enjoy it much better this way. You can always go to the library or get the actual facts later. Take it for what it is, an entertaining movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1279,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT3H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He became a hit actor in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (a personal childhood favourite), The Mask and Dumb and Dumber. He tried hard for an Oscar nom, but always contended with winning Golden Globes. And for years now, he has basically been bouncing around dramas, comedies, and dramedies. So now, he has tackled a remake (of a comedy no less), and the results as per the last few years, are mixed at best.\n\nCarrey is Dick, an employee at Globodyne (read: Enron) who is promoted just in time to help sail the company into oblivion on television. He tells his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) to leave her job only hours before hand, and upon returning stunning home, realizes that he may be in a bit of trouble. As the months go on, the pair's assets slowly begin to dwindle, and hope for continued survival begins to evaporate. So with nothing left to do, they turn to life of petty crime and hope for the best.\n\nIt is not an original concept at all, but Carrey and Leoni do a valiant job keeping this boat floating. While the film does have a few hilarious moments, the rest of it is bogged down by mere snicker-filled sequences or just scenes that are totally unfunny. It's not like these two actors are having any trouble being funny, it's that the material is not funny. Judd Apatow did wonders with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but he fumbles here pretty hard with his writing partner Nicholas Stoller, who does not have nearly enough credits to his name. A parody on what happened at Enron was inevitable, but this just seems lackluster and barely thought out. Subplots are brought in, but barely resolved, and the key storyline just feels very weak by the end. It's not terrible, it just feels a tad bit incomplete.\n\nThe sorry thing about the entire film is the fact that much of it just feels like an extended montage with little payoff. It is only ninety minutes long, so it feels like a lot was trimmed down or cut right out. But the film suffers as a result. If it was longer, it undoubtedly could have had more potential for more funny moments, and as a whole, feel more complete.\n\nWhile Carrey and Leoni do their best, it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Yes, Carrey is right at home with his zany character, and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. But he just lacks that integral element of human comedy here, that made him so famous in the first place. It's unfortunate, and makes me wonder if the old Carrey will ever return, or if we'll have to contend with semi-funny Carrey for the rest of his career. Leoni is much better, and feels more in tune with what she's doing. \n\nEven more unfortunate is the wasted supporting cast does very little. Alec Baldwin as the sleazy CEO Jack McCallister is sparingly unfunny, as is Richard Jenkins as the right hand man Frank Bascombe, who spends most of the movie drunk and not doing anything (besides setting up for the finale). The rest of the cast has little to no screen time, or are simply silly supporting characters that just feel like excess waste in the entire scheme of things.\n\nFor all of it's faults, the film is a worth while watch. As said, I did laugh at some of it. A bit of work on the screenplay would have benefited everyone here. Just do not go in expecting a comedy classic with Jim Carrey. If so, you will be sadly disappointed.\n\n6.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138632,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Step by step, she fits in the team and her colleagues, very reserved at first, become her best friends." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt1418572/","name":"Profilage","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY0ZmE1ZWQtNjEzNy00YWE0LTkzOTgtNjc3MjQ2NWQ4YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI2OTA2NTEw._V1_.jpg","contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551793/","name":"Jean-Michel Martial","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2293347/","name":"Raphaël Ferret","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059600/","name":"Philippe Bas"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0189861/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0166097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011677/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3419168/","name":"Fanny Robert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3435076/","name":"Sophie Lebarbier"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce Saison 9 [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3322984985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdiY2Y0MjktOWQ5OS00M2U5LWJkYmQtNDU2MWU2ODk3N2E3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdiY2Y0MjktOWQ5OS00M2U5LWJkYmQtNDU2MWU2ODk3N2E3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","datePublished":"2009-04-23","description":"Chloé Saint-Laurent is a profiler and works with a police team to solve murders in Paris.

While for the rest we have a standard french police series with the usual amount of crimes and personal life of the police unit members, what makes it unique it's her: goofy, bold, reasoning, she gets the job done her way. I don't think you can remain indifferent to the character: either you like her or not (personally I adore). She earned a place in the long list of eccentric people started, I believe, by Dr. House. The role is played by Odile Vuillemin. Update: season 7 sees the departure of Chloé, substituted by a new profiler, Adèle Delettre, a recurring character in the show. Her approach is very different from Saint-Laurent's and the series takes a more dramatic tone. A bit of sense of humour is missing so I'd give 7/10 to this new "profilage".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1128,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note.

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nekoliko dana prije ispita Bradford i Lopez otkriju da Lucy i Jackson nisu svjedočili svim vrstama zločina, za što im je još ostalo 48 sati. Nolanu nije dodijeljen zadatak na terenu pa ostaje u uredu, dok Talia odgovara pred Unutarnjom kontrolom. Nolan ipak odlučuje pridružiti se Wolfeu. Na ulici Jackson i Lucy nalaze Bena, posljednju žrtvu organiziranih kradljivaca vozila. Na kraju Nolan pomaže uloviti kradljivce, a kasnije stane u obranu Talije pred Unutarnjom kontrolom.</desc>

The script didn't have a decent spot of humor in it (at least the segment I managed to watch). If you don't catch the audience in the first 5 minutes you've lost them. This just got worse as it went along, and about the second time they depicted some guy picking his nose I realized this was not the movie for me... or probably most adults.

I agree with mariamulmasova... this will likely be "painful to watch"... and unlike some of the glowing reviews here, I'm not Ukranian so am not going to upvote this just because of the nationality of the film team.\n\nThe animation is decently done. The script didn't have a decent spot of humor in it (at least the segment I managed to watch). If you don't catch the audience in the first 5 minutes you've lost them. This just got worse as it went along, and about the second time they depicted some guy picking his nose I realized this was not the movie for me... or probably most adults. I strongly suspect many children would eject this groaner and move on to something with a bit more wit and viewer savvy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow.

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was invited to the premiere of The Dressmaker last night and I'm unsure whether I can say I loved it, hated it, thought it was hilarious, found it terribly sad, was frustrated because it was so weird or enjoyed it because some of the characters were so endearing - this movie caused all of these emotions and more. It's certainly entertaining - just so many roller-coaster sensations within the space of only a few minutes. A viewer will fluctuate continually between laughing raucously one minute only to find themselves experiencing deep sadness, anger, confusion or just plain asking yourself 'Why did they include this?' with the next breath. And they're a mix of the most quirky / weird / unlikeable / endearing / heartwarming characters I've ever seen / met. There was one character I didn't like at all, even though at some stages I still found myself laughing at some of their antics. I'm sure many readers will either disagree with me or think I'm referring to someone else - but that's okay, that's what makes us all different. The Dressmaker is definitely worth a look but not something I'd pay to see again - mainly because of the inclusion of that one character already referred to. This movie is very very dark in places and the ending is definitely not what you expect! The dialogue flurries and stubborn, though endearing, rapport constantly firing between Kate Winslet and Judy Davies are exceptional and certainly to be applauded. A very big hats off to Kate for a wonderful portrayal of an Aussie accent - you would swear she is a true blue Aussie. I have never heard anyone who wasn't born here to pull off an Aussie accent with such authenticity as she showed in this. Proves her calibre as an actress and the exceptional talent of Victoria Mielewska, her dialogue coach. Added to all of this, the budget must have been huge as every single person involved was easily recognisable from another movie or TV series - and most of them big Aussie names. So don't bother asking me whether you should go and see it - you'll just have to go along and see for yourself - but I can almost guarantee it's definitely not at all what you'll be expecting. And interestingly, other ladies in two book clubs I am connected to said they felt exactly the same with both the book and the film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55990,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was invited to the premiere of The Dressmaker last night and I'm unsure whether I can say I loved it, hated it, thought it was hilarious, found it terribly sad, was frustrated because it was so weird or enjoyed it because some of the characters were so endearing - this movie caused all of these emotions and more. It's certainly entertaining - just so many roller-coaster sensations within the space of only a few minutes. A viewer will fluctuate continually between laughing raucously one minute only to find themselves experiencing deep sadness, anger, confusion or just plain asking yourself 'Why did they include this?' with the next breath. And they're a mix of the most quirky / weird / unlikeable / endearing / heartwarming characters I've ever seen / met. There was one character I didn't like at all, even though at some stages I still found myself laughing at some of their antics. I'm sure many readers will either disagree with me or think I'm referring to someone else - but that's okay, that's what makes us all different. The Dressmaker is definitely worth a look but not something I'd pay to see again - mainly because of the inclusion of that one character already referred to. This movie is very very dark in places and the ending is definitely not what you expect! The dialogue flurries and stubborn, though endearing, rapport constantly firing between Kate Winslet and Judy Davies are exceptional and certainly to be applauded. A very big hats off to Kate for a wonderful portrayal of an Aussie accent - you would swear she is a true blue Aussie. I have never heard anyone who wasn't born here to pull off an Aussie accent with such authenticity as she showed in this. Proves her calibre as an actress and the exceptional talent of Victoria Mielewska, her dialogue coach. Added to all of this, the budget must have been huge as every single person involved was easily recognisable from another movie or TV series - and most of them big Aussie names. So don't bother asking me whether you should go and see it - you'll just have to go along and see for yourself - but I can almost guarantee it's definitely not at all what you'll be expecting. And interestingly, other ladies in two book clubs I am connected to said they felt exactly the same with both the book and the film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55990,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The writers must not like her either because they give really bad lines (so out of character for the rest of the series). How many times is she going to say "Dad, you are scaring me"?

Outstanding action movie plenty of thrills , suspense , intrigue , twists and turns . An excellent whodunit deals with an air marshal (Liam Neeson) springs into action during a transatlantic flight (the airplane used in the film is a Boeing 767-300) after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account . After several e-mails , only to discover that someone has taken on his account and that no one , not even the crew , believes him . With the help of a young flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) and a likable passenger (Julianne Moore) he sets out to prove who he is . He confronts enemies in order to find out the true killer , but someone is still after him and is forced to take up violent means to discover them . He takes the law on his own hands and acting as a desperate person . The hijacking was just the beginning .\n\nThis exciting film contains suspense , thrills , noisy action, shootouts , violent fights and plot twits . From start to final the frantic action and fast movement is unstopped . The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the airport and mostly plane . However this doesn't make boring it , as the movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers . The aircraft is clearly fictional, a type is never referred to during the course of the film , whilst it appears to be the size of a Boeing 767-400, the cabin interior, door operation &amp; arrangement and flight deck layout do not match this type of aircraft. The set for the plane was built very slightly larger than a standard commercial airliner to accommodate Neeson's 6'4" height for filming and roughly 200 extras were cast , all of them stayed throughout filming . The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn't slow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and intrigue .

Outstanding action movie plenty of thrills , suspense , intrigue , twists and turns . An excellent whodunit deals with an air marshal (Liam Neeson) springs into action during a transatlantic flight (the airplane used in the film is a Boeing 767-300) after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account . After several e-mails , only to discover that someone has taken on his account and that no one , not even the crew , believes him . With the help of a young flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) and a likable passenger (Julianne Moore) he sets out to prove who he is . He confronts enemies in order to find out the true killer , but someone is still after him and is forced to take up violent means to discover them . He takes the law on his own hands and acting as a desperate person . The hijacking was just the beginning .\n\nThis exciting film contains suspense , thrills , noisy action, shootouts , violent fights and plot twits . From start to final the frantic action and fast movement is unstopped . The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the airport and mostly plane . However this doesn't make boring it , as the movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers . The aircraft is clearly fictional, a type is never referred to during the course of the film , whilst it appears to be the size of a Boeing 767-400, the cabin interior, door operation &amp; arrangement and flight deck layout do not match this type of aircraft. The set for the plane was built very slightly larger than a standard commercial airliner to accommodate Neeson's 6'4" height for filming and roughly 200 extras were cast , all of them stayed throughout filming . The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn't slow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and intrigue . Liam Neeson is top-notch as a drunken and discredited air marshal ; Liam Neeson has propelled many an action thriller to big box office numbers, as Unknown , Taken 2 and this Non-stop . Accompany efficiently to starring two nice actresses as Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery . There are many suspects , all support cast formed by good secondaries such as Scoot McNairy , Corey Stoll , Jon Abrahams , Nate Parker , Jason Butler , Linus Roache , Shea Whigham , Anson Mount and Lupita Nyong'o who in her next film would win an Academy Award .\n\nColorful cinematography by cameraman Flavio Martinez Labiano using Steadicam and with majority locations from plane interior . The musician John Ottman creates a stirring , rousing soundtrack fitting to frenetic action . Lavishly produced including spectacular scenes by the successful American producer Joel Silver . The flick was compellingly directed by Jaume Collet-Serra . Collet is an expert director of terror movies as ¨Orphan¨, ¨House of wax¨ and for TV , ¨The river¨ , and of course his greatest hit was ¨Unknown¨ also with Liam Neeson and similar artistic team as cameraman Flavio Laviano , musician John Ottman and producer Joel Silver .

The "device" of throwing in anachronistic touches (Google, cell phone, Coca Cola, etc) backfire.

Instead, I got a pretentious muddle of history and fantasy given in an underlit and murky tableau that's as dull as the narrative.\n\nEthan Hawke plays Tesla (sans accent) as if sleepwalking. But it doesn'r matter because the story has nothing to tell us anyway. We get disjointed scenes that depict this and that, some historical and some made up. They add up to not much of anything. The "device" of throwing in anachronistic touches (Google, cell phone, Coca Cola, etc) backfire. But the major atrocity is when Hawke's Tesla picks up a microphone and starts a karaoke session of "Everybody Wants to Rule the Word."\n\nAvoid this garbage and spend your time reading the Wikipedia article on Tesla.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7444,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story is pretty basic, especially considering how much thought and care went into everything else about this movie. Jen, the last of his kind, must find a shard of the crystal, and slot it back into place. Why? He doesn't know, but he embarks on the journey nonetheless, a journey that has him meet a variety of characters and creatures along the way. That's literally it; the entire story.\n\nThankfully there's heaps more to this movie than just its superficial story. For starters, the world created for the movie is quite unlike anything I've ever seen. It's a wholly original affair from the ground up. We're told through an opening narration that we are on a different planet, in a different time, and that it used to be peaceful and beautiful, but something happened when the crystal fractured and two brand new species emerged. The Skeksis are dark and greedy, vain and selfish. They hoard all they can and constantly fight amongst themselves, but they're a dying race, quite literally decaying as time goes on. Now there's only ten of them, who spend their time holed up in a macabre castle in a wasteland. On the flipside are the urRu, a group of placid, lumbering, four-armed creatures who live amongst the life magic around them. Jen is a Gelfling, the last of his kind after the Skeksis wiped the rest of them from the face of the planet. There's also the Podlings which are a small and timid people hunted by the Skeksis and exploited as slaves, the Garthim, a race of giant arachnid beetles who the Skeksis use as their muscle, and lastly Aughra, an ogre-like oracle who studies the planets and brews potions for trade.\n\nImmediately I was struck by how dark this movie really is. Of course I've always found 80s fantasy movies to be of a darker calibre than any other period, but The Dark Crystal is darker than most. The Skeksis are a truly villainous race, with a frightening appearance, and a disturbing penchant for sucking the life out of their victims before using the zombified husks as slaves, not to mention the off-screen genocide they committed against the Gelflings. And this is a movie for kids! Of course, being aimed at a younger audience means it's not as horrific as it could be for adult eyes, but it still manages to skirt the line just enough.\n\nBut of course the single biggest lure for The Dark Crystal are the technical aspects. This was the first live-action movie not to feature humans at all. The closest it gets is with people dressed up as Jen and Kira in longshots to make running and climbing more feasible. To make up for the distinct lack of people, the puppetry department goes all out. I don't think I've ever seen puppetry this amazing, not even in other Jim Henson productions. There's so much detail put into every aspect of this movie. Each of the ten Skeksis are resplendently designed in such a way to be distinctly different to one another. They have different facial features, wear different clothes, and even act differently (as portrayed in a fantastic dinner scene displaying how varied their eating habits are). The urRu also have an incredible amount of detail just on their faces alone, but also the way they slowly lumber about and their four arms interact with one another. The sheer amount of practice this must have taken from their dual performers is impressive alone. The settings and world around the characters are also brimming with life. There's a staggering amount of creatures and animals here, each with their own role in the local ecosystems. You may only see one briefly in the background, but even they enjoy the same attention to detail. There's just so much here. It's a full and brimming world that's so easy to be immersed into. They even wrote fictional languages for each of the main races! I would love to have seen a version with this, but even I can admit that maybe would have been too much for a movie with already risky prospects at the time.\n\nI'm hard-pushed to called The Dark Crystal a masterpiece, because there are some deep flaws here. The story is incredibly simplistic and is far from original, the Gelflings for some reason don't seem to enjoy the same attention to detail as everyone else, despite being the heroes of the whole story, and the dialogue and narration is a little lacking in places. Beyond that, this movie was still amazing to watch today and it's technical achievements still hold up. I'm looking forward to delving into Age of Resistance later. I give Dark Crystal a really, really good 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63726,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After she sleeps with Weisman, the lead contractor building a barbecue shed in the backyard of her beach house, the other two workers on the job cross a boundary, making Laura feel that her space has been encroached upon. As Weisman disappears, sheltered and privileged Laura must manage the laborers herself. Her admonishments fall flat, forcing her to retreat behind the pristine glass windows-keeping watch and being watched simultaneously. Tensions churn, the workers become more unruly, and Laura ignores calls from her husband while downing bottles of red wine, waiting for Weisman to reappear. By escalating the tension from one scene to the next, writer/director Verónica Chen relentlessly pushes her story-and Laura-to the breaking point. Using light and shadow, expansive overhead shots, and tight close-ups, Chen builds an unsettling atmosphere situated on differences of class and power.

So Long My Son picks up that chronological baton, and tells a story about family bonds, the meaning of friendship and what constitutes our morals and ethics through the last 30/40 years of Chinese history, from a stilted, materially basic time of 1980 through to the hypermodernity of China in the 2010s.\n\nIn the same way To Live aimed thinly disguised critiques at the Chinese government's policies through showing its impact on ordinary people, So Long My Son fires a number of shots too and it's in fact a little surprising to me some of these have been overlooked by the censors. The most obvious of them is the criticism of the one child policy, but hidden in there too are mentions of the privatisation of state owned industries in the early 90s and the mass redundancies that went with them, as well as criticism of the wealth inequality of modern China that has ensued from the market economy transition of the 80s and 90s.\n\nI'm unsure if this was a problem specific to the release version I saw, though I have seen other reviews saying the plot was hard to follow, but I noticed that the English subtitles was often only translating about 1/5 of the dialogue in Mandarin. As a speaker of both, I followed the plot and characters quite easily, but can absolutely understand why many reviewers and comments have said they found the characters and plots hard to distinguish if the subtitling was a problem. However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT3H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So Long My Son picks up that chronological baton, and tells a story about family bonds, the meaning of friendship and what constitutes our morals and ethics through the last 30/40 years of Chinese history, from a stilted, materially basic time of 1980 through to the hypermodernity of China in the 2010s.\n\nIn the same way To Live aimed thinly disguised critiques at the Chinese government's policies through showing its impact on ordinary people, So Long My Son fires a number of shots too and it's in fact a little surprising to me some of these have been overlooked by the censors. The most obvious of them is the criticism of the one child policy, but hidden in there too are mentions of the privatisation of state owned industries in the early 90s and the mass redundancies that went with them, as well as criticism of the wealth inequality of modern China that has ensued from the market economy transition of the 80s and 90s.\n\nI'm unsure if this was a problem specific to the release version I saw, though I have seen other reviews saying the plot was hard to follow, but I noticed that the English subtitles was often only translating about 1/5 of the dialogue in Mandarin. As a speaker of both, I followed the plot and characters quite easily, but can absolutely understand why many reviewers and comments have said they found the characters and plots hard to distinguish if the subtitling was a problem. However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT3H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under your skin.

I especially loved the middle part - where all the characters try to find a way out of the problem and when for the first time they seem to be facing a fracture between them.\n\nI thought it had a great power on people even though it doesn't seem to have had the effect I was expecting (at least during the premiere in Venice).\n\nEddie Redmayne hasn't had enough of his Oscar and I wish him all the best for 2016!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As an "X-Phile" I'm obviously interested in the subject matter. The idea of a show based on the real-life Project Blue Book investigations is intriguing. The historical setting is a nice change of pace.\n\nThe problem is that tonally and conceptually, the show is inconsistent. Characters often seem to have multiple personality disorder.\n\nDuring the course of a typical episode, the two main characters (Aidan Gillen and Michael Malarkey), as well as their immediate superior (Neal McDonough) will vacillate many times between (a) seeming to believe that people are having UFO and alien (and occasionally other Fortean) encounters, (b) seeming to think that the idea of UFO and alien encounters is pure bunk, and (c) being more agnostic about it but seeming to think that their job is (i) ultimately to provide b.s. cover stories for the government, or (ii) ultimately to be subversive and suggest that the government is covering up something.\n\nA lot of screen time that could be spent on investigations is spent on inter-character drama where our stars take turns being on opposing sides of (a), (b), (c)(i) and (c)(ii) above. It becomes confusing. You don't know who is on what side. It's usually not clear what anyone's goal is exactly. And the bosses seem to continually make decisions--including many times that Project Blue Book was going to be closed or at least our investigators fired--that they renege on within 20 minutes.\n\nThe pacing and overall aesthetic--even the style of dialogue delivery, reminds me a lot of the video game L.A. Noire, which wasn't exactly a blockbuster, but it had its fans.\n\nWith less vacillation, better character focus, more attention on weird phenomena and investigations, and a bit more action this could be an excellent show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As an "X-Phile" I'm obviously interested in the subject matter. The idea of a show based on the real-life Project Blue Book investigations is intriguing. The historical setting is a nice change of pace.\n\nThe problem is that tonally and conceptually, the show is inconsistent. Characters often seem to have multiple personality disorder.\n\nDuring the course of a typical episode, the two main characters (Aidan Gillen and Michael Malarkey), as well as their immediate superior (Neal McDonough) will vacillate many times between (a) seeming to believe that people are having UFO and alien (and occasionally other Fortean) encounters, (b) seeming to think that the idea of UFO and alien encounters is pure bunk, and (c) being more agnostic about it but seeming to think that their job is (i) ultimately to provide b.s. cover stories for the government, or (ii) ultimately to be subversive and suggest that the government is covering up something.\n\nA lot of screen time that could be spent on investigations is spent on inter-character drama where our stars take turns being on opposing sides of (a), (b), (c)(i) and (c)(ii) above. It becomes confusing. You don't know who is on what side. It's usually not clear what anyone's goal is exactly. And the bosses seem to continually make decisions--including many times that Project Blue Book was going to be closed or at least our investigators fired--that they renege on within 20 minutes.\n\nThe pacing and overall aesthetic--even the style of dialogue delivery, reminds me a lot of the video game L.A. Noire, which wasn't exactly a blockbuster, but it had its fans.\n\nWith less vacillation, better character focus, more attention on weird phenomena and investigations, and a bit more action this could be an excellent show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First of all because they are educational. They tell us about how life was under the Weimar Republic (the democratic regime in Germany between 1919 and 1933). I am tired of all those cliches about Germany as fascistland, ignoring the rich history this country had before authoritarianism.\n\nIn Germany 1929, the country is falling apart because of the great depression combined with the crippling punishment of Versailles treaty, plus almost all adult males are crippled because of WWI or heavily shell shocked, with seizures and convilsions that prevented them of working or actually leading normal lives. Starvation, homelessness, drug use and prostitition (male, female and transvestite ) are essentially the only way many families resort in order to feed their children and older relatives. Heroin addiction is a menace, and that despair is driving people to embrace any charlatan, demagogue or ideology that promises bringing them a better future (which at the time, was not fascim yet, but Bolshevism, with Trotskyists and Stalinist competing and fighting each other).\n\nDespite all that hopelessness and misery that Germans were enduring, there is an incredible cultural scene happening in Berlin, where the nightlife is intense, American Jazz musicians and dancers achieve success, the arts (Cinema, design, architecture, music) is evolving, there is a lot of beauty and reckless sex happening. Decadence is the word to describe the atmosphere, where a caste society lives another planet, with country clubs, mansions and servants, while the plight of the majority is simply ignored. It almost feel like the Blade Runner society.\n\nIt is not mentioned in the series, but at the time, Albert Einstein was a professor in Berlin, and Fritz Lang was the king of Cinema, Walter Gropius founded Bauhaus by that time, Vladimir Nabokov was living there, in short, the great Europeans minds flocked to Berlin in the late 1920s. So what you appreciate in the series is this dicotomy. How a society with so much brilliance, talent and efficiency could have rebuild itself slowly and become a prosperous nation, but later the population made wrong choices and followed the call that ended up in a disaster that they will never recover. I was in Berlin 2 tears ago, and saw how damaged the city is and felt so sorry for them and their curse.\n\nThe series gives us some contex that help us understand how many people, mostly good intentioned, ended up supporting a system in 1933 that was almost non existent in the 20s (fascism). Their regime at the time was democratic, with a free press, a legal system, parliament, etc.\n\nBabylon Berlin is not only politics. It is also thriller, romance, drama and action. The main actors Gereon and Lotte are very charismatic and you cheer for them all the time, because they come from disfunctional families, but they try to do the right thing all the time. It is almos impossible not to fall in love with Lotte. \n\nThe rest of the cast is also very good looking, but still keeping the beauty standars accurate with the early 20th century. Their nude bodies are beautiful, but never arousing. The nakedness is constant, but never out of place. And people smoke all the time, whic is also accurate. There is almost no scene without a cigarette.\n\nI hope most people enjoy just like I did","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-10-13","keywords":"berlin germany,1920s,police,weimar republic,interwar period","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1432815/","name":"Volker Bruch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2939186/","name":"Liv Lisa Fries","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2914059/","name":"Leonie Benesch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061958/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044017/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359634/","name":"Henk Handloegten","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0902022/","name":"Achim von Borries"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2628238873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Started out a bit boring, then a few sub plots were introduced that seemed pointless at first. But wow!! By the last 2-3 episodes I couldn't stop watching. The character development is very slow, and we are shown the worst of everyone first, it seems. As the show progresses, we see almost everyone has some redeeming humanity (and secrets, always secrets). The backdrop of all this is the cinematic paradise of the American Southwest circa 1940, and a war story that we all know how it ends. I feel like I was invited on a blind date, only to find by the end that I have made all kinds of new friends. I hope to hear WGN is going ahead with season 2.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8078,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She's the star but certainly not alone in delivering quite engaging, excellent characterization, and entertaining performances.\n\nThis series goes to show that today's television doesn't have to depict violence, gore, profanity, or much that older children couldn't watch.

She's the star but certainly not alone in delivering quite engaging, excellent characterization, and entertaining performances.\n\nThis series goes to show that today's television doesn't have to depict violence, gore, profanity, or much that older children couldn't watch. Yet, for an adult who likes Cronenberg's and Lynch's films, this clean cut show is quite interesting without being too 'vanilla'. \n\nSedgewick has really come into her character by this third season and I like it far better than "24" which has now become monotonously predictable. There's no guessing what Deputy Chief Johnson will do to protect and close one of her cases!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23916,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

She's the star but certainly not alone in delivering quite engaging, excellent characterization, and entertaining performances.\n\nThis series goes to show that today's television doesn't have to depict violence, gore, profanity, or much that older children couldn't watch. Yet, for an adult who likes Cronenberg's and Lynch's films, this clean cut show is quite interesting without being too 'vanilla'. \n\nSedgewick has really come into her character by this third season and I like it far better than "24" which has now become monotonously predictable. There's no guessing what Deputy Chief Johnson will do to protect and close one of her cases!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23916,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

I watch it on TV5 where it is subtitled, but like many French series it isn't available to purchase with the subtitles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-10-05","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0938381/","name":"Smadi Wolfman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4512247/","name":"Mourad Boudaoud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0216470/","name":"Julie Delarme"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010448/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124813/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0037868/","name":"Bertrand Arthuys","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2978041/","name":"Alexis Le Sec"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce Saison 1 [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1341832473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk1MGJiMGUtNTA4NS00OGYxLWJjMTgtOTAyM2Y5ZDRiMGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk1MGJiMGUtNTA4NS00OGYxLWJjMTgtOTAyM2Y5ZDRiMGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Personally, I'm a fan of stories that mix history in fiction, so perhaps I'm bias in its favor, but there are several aspects of this series which are successful.\n\nThe show's premise is actually fairly straight forward. The characters of Harry Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle team up with a plucky female detective from Scotland Yard in order to solve a series of cases. Naturally, each of mysteries have what appear to be some element of the supernatural. Most of the stories also touch on the personal struggles of the two leads, so watching from the beginning will enhance your ability to to follow and enjoy each episodes.\n\nWhat really makes this series are the actors. In addition to having really talented leads, the cast is strong overall. Perhaps it's just me, but I am sick to death of reality TV and hackneyed sit-coms. Consequently, getting to watch actors who actually know how to act is, for me, more valuable than ever.\n\nAnother thing that makes this very enjoyable to watch is its visual appeal. The costumes and set designs are very well done and, even if not always historically accurate, evocative of a romantic and bygone era.\n\nThe stories themselves are fast-paced and fairly intricate by today's standards.

Personally, I'm a fan of stories that mix history in fiction, so perhaps I'm bias in its favor, but there are several aspects of this series which are successful.\n\nThe show's premise is actually fairly straight forward. The characters of Harry Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle team up with a plucky female detective from Scotland Yard in order to solve a series of cases. Naturally, each of mysteries have what appear to be some element of the supernatural. Most of the stories also touch on the personal struggles of the two leads, so watching from the beginning will enhance your ability to to follow and enjoy each episodes.\n\nWhat really makes this series are the actors. In addition to having really talented leads, the cast is strong overall. Perhaps it's just me, but I am sick to death of reality TV and hackneyed sit-coms. Consequently, getting to watch actors who actually know how to act is, for me, more valuable than ever.\n\nAnother thing that makes this very enjoyable to watch is its visual appeal. The costumes and set designs are very well done and, even if not always historically accurate, evocative of a romantic and bygone era.\n\nThe stories themselves are fast-paced and fairly intricate by today's standards. They also blend fantasy and reality in a way that's pretty darn appealing.\n\nAlthough billed as a mini-series, if this show doesn't get a second run it will be a shame. It's charming, beautiful, and very watchable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-13","keywords":"psychotronic series,tv mini series","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922995/","name":"Michael Weston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542118/","name":"Stephen Mangan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146945/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0131363/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395924/","name":"David Hoselton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0864435/","name":"David N.

I liked that they didn't make Burke an idiot like they normally do. In fact none of the characters are made out to be naive or stupid, which is refreshing in television nowadays. I also found Burke and Caffrey's relationship very charming- the writers didn't pretend to make them dislike each other and to have Caffrey forced upon Burke but instead they have respect for each other and at separate times they both show the level of their friendship with each other.\n\nI found the show charming and funny. It is finally a show that doesn't take itself seriously 100% of the time. You have the nice balance of the personal struggle of Caffrey to find Kate mixed with the episodes storyline, a balance which I think works effectively.\n\nDefinitely watch this show if you enjoy something that is both easy to watch and entertaining.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123199,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-10-23","keywords":"thief,white collar crime,brilliant mind,name calling,nickname","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093589/","name":"Matt Bomer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215229/","name":"Tim DeKay"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0288470/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094955/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247609/","name":"Jeff Eastin"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"White Collar: Season Six","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433724697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for White Collar The Complete Sixth Season"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I liked that they didn't make Burke an idiot like they normally do. In fact none of the characters are made out to be naive or stupid, which is refreshing in television nowadays. I also found Burke and Caffrey's relationship very charming- the writers didn't pretend to make them dislike each other and to have Caffrey forced upon Burke but instead they have respect for each other and at separate times they both show the level of their friendship with each other.\n\nI found the show charming and funny. It is finally a show that doesn't take itself seriously 100% of the time. You have the nice balance of the personal struggle of Caffrey to find Kate mixed with the episodes storyline, a balance which I think works effectively.\n\nDefinitely watch this show if you enjoy something that is both easy to watch and entertaining.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123199,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-10-23","keywords":"thief,white collar crime,brilliant mind,name calling,nickname","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093589/","name":"Matt Bomer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215229/","name":"Tim DeKay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0288470/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094955/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247609/","name":"Jeff Eastin"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"White Collar: Season Six","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433724697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for White Collar The Complete Sixth Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Here, rather than waiting out the evil regency of Prince John and his minions until King Richard returns from the Crusades, Richard is already dead. His death comes very early on in the movie in battle in France. John is the King of England in this movie, and rather than an unselfish "robbing the rich to give to the poor" type character, Robin (actually in this movie Robin Longstride, who finds himself impersonating Robert of Locksley and becomes known as "Robin of the Hood") is a more complex character. I wouldn't say exactly noble - especially in the beginning - and his battle is not so much for the poor as it's a battle for the "rights" of the English people, as he eventually takes on what seems to be the fight to get John to sign what I assume is Magna Carta, and at least temporarily has to ally himself with John to help lead the defence of England against a French invasion.\n\nThe different historical setting is a bit disorienting to be honest - especially at first - but it also gives a degree of unpredictability to what's going to happen, and once you get a sense of where you are, when you are and what the fight is about it's easy enough to understand what's going on. Russell Crowe did a commendable job, I thought, in this alternate portrayal of Robin, and Cate Blanchett was most certainly a different kind of Marion. She's not the Maid Marion of legend. She's tough, she's a fighter, she goes into battle with the French - although not leading the battle, there's almost a Joan of Arc quality to her (minus the voice of God.) I was quite taken with Oscar Isaac as King John. He took the part and made it real. John came across as I would expect him to from the historical record - shifty and conniving, untrustworthy, quite willing to make and break whatever alliances are necessary at any given moment to ensure his survival as King and sometimes quite befuddled by his responsibilities. Perhaps a weakness was the fact that there was no real focus on Robin's men. Really only Will Scarlett (played by Scott Grimes) and Friar Tuck (played by Mark Addy) were significant elements in the story, and even they weren't particularly important.\n\nThe sets and setting were good.

Since the movie ends with the caption "And so the legend begins" one wonders if a sequel might be in the works, perhaps detailing the struggle leading up to the actually signing of Magna Carta?

Inteligentno pisana, subverzivno humoristična i simpatično duhovita. Simpsoni, animirana serija s najduljim stažem emitiranja, kulturne institucije s izuzetno odanim i predanim krugom obožavatelja. Inteligentno pisana, subverzivno humoristična i simpatično duhovita, serija ismijava okolinu, ali i samu sebe. Dobitnica je brojnih nagrada. Simpsoni su uz to trenutačni vlasnici dva Guinnesova rekorda i to kao najdulje emitirana animirana serija i serija s najviše ugošćenih zvijezda. Obitelj Simpson čine: otac Homer, koji radi kao inspektor zaštite na radu u mjesnoj nuklearnoj elektrani, majka Marge, koja pokušava zadržati mir u obitelji, nestašni desetogodišnjak Bart, inteligentna saksofonistica osmogodišnja Lisa i najmanja Maggie, koja emocije izražava dudanjem. Gledatelji su s vremenom upoznali i zavoljeli preostali bogati i nerijetko neobični svijet likova koji žive u Springfieldu.Simpsoni, koje je osmislio animator Matt Groening, prvi su se put pojavili 1987. kao serija kratkih priča u 30 sekunda koje je Groening producirao za The Tracy Ullman Show. Uskoro su dobili vlastitu seriju emitiravši se prvi put u božićnom specijalu 17. prosinca 1989., a zatim i u redovnom terminu 14. siječnja 1990. Posjeduju svoju zvijezdu na holivudskoj Stazi slavnih, a 1. svibnja 2005. američka najzabavnija obitelj proslavila je tada rekordnu 350. epizodu.</desc>

It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":269989,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Are they serious that they were going to make a show about a bunch of shallow people living on a street having sex and complaining about not having enough sex? But at the end, I was wrong.\n\nThis is a show about misunderstood and troubled people who really cares about each other and shows it. They are human and they hurt people like everyday-people do. I love this show and it is so humane and the characters are so likable in every single way.\n\nThe desperate housewives are portrayed by Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, and Eva Longoria. As much I hate the character Gabrielle, I have to say, I have to love Eva Logoria's charm because she is delightful to watch as a person in interviews. I love the character Bree. She is so stunning to watch as this perfectionist with a family that is nothing but 'perfect.' Felicity Huffman plays the real everyday-mom who's stressed - Lynette, who's also an great character. There's Teri Hatcher's character, Susan, which I liked at first but she gets boring but she does have a great cheerleader, her daughter Julie, who is probably much more likable than her.\n\nAnd there's Edie Britt ... the 'slut' of the neighborhood. I hated her at first, but then, slowly, loved her.\n\nWhat makes this show so creative is that it is narrated by a housewife that committed suicide on episode one. It is an extremely nice turn in television.\n\nThis is my favorite show ... next to Lost. ABC is doing very well this season."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120790,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-10-03","keywords":"voice over narration,undercover,husband wife relationship,conflict of interest,female protagonist","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000159/","name":"Teri Hatcher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005031/","name":"Felicity Huffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189220/","name":"Marcia Cross"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028589/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156100/","name":"Marc Cherry"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1644955417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"TT #1"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gere does not get enough credit for being a good actor, and with this performance he shows what enormous range he has.  His Dr. T is so engaging and charming, that it is easy to see why he has the following he does.

"Dr. T and the Women" is Altman's latest, and in telling the story of a popular Dallas gynecologist and the females in his life, Altman has made one of his most enjoyable films yet.  Richard Gere gives what has to be his best performance to date as Dr. Sullivan "Sully" Travis.  Gere does not get enough credit for being a good actor, and with this performance he shows what enormous range he has.  His Dr. T is so engaging and charming, that it is easy to see why he has the following he does.  Gere's performance is the centerpiece of a quirky, funny, and hugely entertaining film, one of the best of 2000.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19345,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"gynecologist,public nudity,vagina,cheerleader,lesbian kiss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dr. T and the Women","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007105817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVkNzMyZjItMzVhZi00MGU3LThmM2YtZjdkMjQxNmRkYzY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVkNzMyZjItMzVhZi00MGU3LThmM2YtZjdkMjQxNmRkYzY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000166/","name":"Helen Hunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000396/","name":"Farrah Fawcett"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000265/","name":"Robert Altman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033691/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710828/","name":"Anne Rapp"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At this point, the girls are old enough for fans to not care what happens to them. But we keep coming back to see them every movie and every episode. We're so used to these characters we need them in our lives supposedly, but after this movie, my love for this show is drastically decreased. My hope for this film to be a successful follow up was brought to a tease when watching the first hour of this film.\n\nTo begin with, the film has a miserable run time. Two hours and thirty minutes may work for a superhero film or LOTR prequel, but who the hell thought it would work for a Comedy about four women? The first film had the almost the same run time, though it was entertaining and it was fun to see the characters do what they did in the second film like struggle with wedding plans and try on dresses. This is jam packed with racist, stereotypical jokes about homosexuals, Jewish people, and Middle Eastern people as well. I'm sure if Prince of Persia didn't steal the subtitle, The Sands of Time, it would belong as the subtitle of SATC2.\n\nThe plot is all four women are struggling with their marriages. Carrie (Parker) wants more "sparkle" with her man "Big", Charlotte (Davis) has trouble keeping her two children under control and frets the nanny (Eve) is getting too close to her husband, Miranda (Nixon) is stressed with work and not there for her kid when she needs to be, and Samantha (Cattrall) is still sleeping with the whole town. All knowing their stressed, Samantha books a vacation for the girls to fly in n extreme first class condition to the Middle East where jokes take the route for stereotypical, and the lackluster level plummets straight into the ground.\n\nIts sad to see a once brilliant series take the route of crap, but if it were to keep going on and maintain the same jokes as seen in this, it's better off dead. I said before the first movie was just as long, but interesting to see the characters get into fun mischief and have fun, intelligent talks. In this sequel, an intelligent and interesting talk is hard to come by. Every talk is followed by some bad joke or stupid sexual comment, no talk is perfect in this film.\n\nOverall, the film is mediocre and just a bore. There are some humorous scenes by Carrie and Big, but with a big name like Sex and the City, it should've been extraordinary and have been on many critics "Best of the year" list. Instead it makes the "Worst of the year" list and probably will earn the title "The worst film of the year" by most critics. Wouldn't surprise me if the cameo by Miley Cyrus is nominated for a Razzie Award. Lord knows the film will be too.\n\nStarring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Alice Eve, Chris Noth, John Corbett, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Miley Cyrus, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lewis, Lynn Cohen, and Liza Minnelli.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":76357,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-06-02","keywords":"sexually empowered woman,promiscuous woman,sex comedy,kissing a married woman,sex in bed","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi196609817","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4NjUzMzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5NTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4NjUzMzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5NTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sex and the City -- Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455078/","name":"Michael Patrick King"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455078/","name":"Michael Patrick King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124299/","name":"Candace Bushnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"}],"duration":"PT2H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At this point, the girls are old enough for fans to not care what happens to them. But we keep coming back to see them every movie and every episode. We're so used to these characters we need them in our lives supposedly, but after this movie, my love for this show is drastically decreased. My hope for this film to be a successful follow up was brought to a tease when watching the first hour of this film.\n\nTo begin with, the film has a miserable run time. Two hours and thirty minutes may work for a superhero film or LOTR prequel, but who the hell thought it would work for a Comedy about four women? The first film had the almost the same run time, though it was entertaining and it was fun to see the characters do what they did in the second film like struggle with wedding plans and try on dresses. This is jam packed with racist, stereotypical jokes about homosexuals, Jewish people, and Middle Eastern people as well. I'm sure if Prince of Persia didn't steal the subtitle, The Sands of Time, it would belong as the subtitle of SATC2.\n\nThe plot is all four women are struggling with their marriages. Carrie (Parker) wants more "sparkle" with her man "Big", Charlotte (Davis) has trouble keeping her two children under control and frets the nanny (Eve) is getting too close to her husband, Miranda (Nixon) is stressed with work and not there for her kid when she needs to be, and Samantha (Cattrall) is still sleeping with the whole town. All knowing their stressed, Samantha books a vacation for the girls to fly in n extreme first class condition to the Middle East where jokes take the route for stereotypical, and the lackluster level plummets straight into the ground.\n\nIts sad to see a once brilliant series take the route of crap, but if it were to keep going on and maintain the same jokes as seen in this, it's better off dead. I said before the first movie was just as long, but interesting to see the characters get into fun mischief and have fun, intelligent talks. In this sequel, an intelligent and interesting talk is hard to come by. Every talk is followed by some bad joke or stupid sexual comment, no talk is perfect in this film.\n\nOverall, the film is mediocre and just a bore. There are some humorous scenes by Carrie and Big, but with a big name like Sex and the City, it should've been extraordinary and have been on many critics "Best of the year" list. Instead it makes the "Worst of the year" list and probably will earn the title "The worst film of the year" by most critics. Wouldn't surprise me if the cameo by Miley Cyrus is nominated for a Razzie Award. Lord knows the film will be too.\n\nStarring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Alice Eve, Chris Noth, John Corbett, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Miley Cyrus, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lewis, Lynn Cohen, and Liza Minnelli.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":76357,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-06-02","keywords":"sexually empowered woman,promiscuous woman,sex comedy,kissing a married woman,sex in bed","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi196609817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4NjUzMzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5NTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4NjUzMzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5NTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sex and the City -- Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455078/","name":"Michael Patrick King"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455078/","name":"Michael Patrick King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124299/","name":"Candace Bushnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"],"duration":"PT2H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

An older Denzel Washington has begun to emerge, and his performance here suggests he has many good years left. Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He, and the plot, keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues, they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.\n\nOne major quibble: Jodie Foster's character is more archetype than person so it's to her credit that she pulls it off as well as it does. However, don't let that deter you from enjoying one of the best movies of the year. I'm glad to see Spike Lee tackle another genre film. He brings a re-invigorating approach to what, in other hands, would be a tiresome rehash. That liveliness seems to have worked on him, too -- this is his best film in several years.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":349206,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It wouldn't be the last time, however, that the portrayal was an exaggeration of coprolalia (the swearing tic), the shock value of which was used for a cheap and easy laugh.\n\nOver the years, I've seen that many people have presumptions about this neurological disorder - understandable, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, I've also learned the hard way that many of these presumptions have been heavily (and negatively) biased towards this inferred 'swearing tic', and I can't help but feel like Deuce Bigalow, or Not Another Teen Movie, or others, have helped shape this presumption.\n\nThe presumption honestly doesn't bother me, provided the person holding the belief is willing to have a conversation with me about it. I've always been open about my Tourette, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate to have won awards, or spoken with the media, or inspired others, due to my openness and having some small success with writing and acting.\n\nWhat does get to me, though, is when the people aren't willing to have a conversation with me. I've been fired from jobs once it's become known that I have Tourette, even though it hasn't affected my work. I've had dates suddenly lose interest. I've been kicked out of bars when bouncers have mistaken my tics for drug use and refused to hear any explanation without threatening violence.\n\nSo when I heard that Edward Norton would be portraying someone with Tourette Syndrome in #MotherlessBrooklyn, I was excited to see what an actor of such calibre would do with such a complex condition. And I was not disappointed.\n\nMotherless Brooklyn is great. Adapted from the novel and written and directed for the screen by Edward himself, the film is an enthralling and charming noir detective piece peppered with big names playing relatively small roles, all of whom tell a captivating story about government corruption in 1950s New York.\n\nEdward's presentation of Tourette Syndrome was refreshing. It was delivered with a level of maturity and respect that is seldom seen on the silver screen. And even though the condition is never outright named in the film, much like his tics, it can't be hidden from anyone watching.\n\nAnd yes, his character does have coprolalia, and echolalia (the tic where you have to repeat things said), and other verbal and motor tics. And sometimes it's funny. But his tics aren't just a cheap laugh for the audience - they affect his character. A PI trying to stay unnoticed on the subway who suddenly blurts out some choice words and draws attention to himself is funny. And when he's consoling someone and can't stop touching their shoulder, it's funny. And when they reassure him that it's okay, it's endearing.\n\nAnd it's okay for us to laugh at the realities of life, however absurd or uncontrollable they may be at times. Tourette Syndrome is real and sometimes it's funny and that's okay. But at least in this film, we're finally laughing at it for the right reasons. And with his portrayal, which also shows some of the positives that can come with Tourette - as opposed to just the obviously stare-inducing drawbacks - I am hopeful that this may help provide the less-aware with a better, more informed presumption about this condition.\n\nAre there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and who are open about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. Like me. But I'm not Edward Norton. And are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and closeted about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. But they are also not Edward Norton.\n\nThe issue of roles going to actors who don't live with the condition being portrayed has been a hot-button issue for many, and I do think there are instances where the role should have gone to someone else. This isn't one of those times. Actors are actors, after all - their job is to convince you that they're not pretending.\n\nEdward was convincing. And I - and I imagine a number of others with Tourette Syndrome who have been subject to unfair or illegal treatment due, at least in part, to a sub-par late '90s movie - thank him for being so. I was fortunate enough to see this at TIFF this year, where he introduced the film. Had he stayed for a Q&amp;A afterwards, I would have loved to have said this to him in person. But I doubt I am the first, and know I won't be the last, person to say this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It wouldn't be the last time, however, that the portrayal was an exaggeration of coprolalia (the swearing tic), the shock value of which was used for a cheap and easy laugh.\n\nOver the years, I've seen that many people have presumptions about this neurological disorder - understandable, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, I've also learned the hard way that many of these presumptions have been heavily (and negatively) biased towards this inferred 'swearing tic', and I can't help but feel like Deuce Bigalow, or Not Another Teen Movie, or others, have helped shape this presumption.\n\nThe presumption honestly doesn't bother me, provided the person holding the belief is willing to have a conversation with me about it. I've always been open about my Tourette, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate to have won awards, or spoken with the media, or inspired others, due to my openness and having some small success with writing and acting.\n\nWhat does get to me, though, is when the people aren't willing to have a conversation with me. I've been fired from jobs once it's become known that I have Tourette, even though it hasn't affected my work. I've had dates suddenly lose interest. I've been kicked out of bars when bouncers have mistaken my tics for drug use and refused to hear any explanation without threatening violence.\n\nSo when I heard that Edward Norton would be portraying someone with Tourette Syndrome in #MotherlessBrooklyn, I was excited to see what an actor of such calibre would do with such a complex condition. And I was not disappointed.\n\nMotherless Brooklyn is great. Adapted from the novel and written and directed for the screen by Edward himself, the film is an enthralling and charming noir detective piece peppered with big names playing relatively small roles, all of whom tell a captivating story about government corruption in 1950s New York.\n\nEdward's presentation of Tourette Syndrome was refreshing. It was delivered with a level of maturity and respect that is seldom seen on the silver screen. And even though the condition is never outright named in the film, much like his tics, it can't be hidden from anyone watching.\n\nAnd yes, his character does have coprolalia, and echolalia (the tic where you have to repeat things said), and other verbal and motor tics. And sometimes it's funny. But his tics aren't just a cheap laugh for the audience - they affect his character. A PI trying to stay unnoticed on the subway who suddenly blurts out some choice words and draws attention to himself is funny. And when he's consoling someone and can't stop touching their shoulder, it's funny. And when they reassure him that it's okay, it's endearing.\n\nAnd it's okay for us to laugh at the realities of life, however absurd or uncontrollable they may be at times. Tourette Syndrome is real and sometimes it's funny and that's okay. But at least in this film, we're finally laughing at it for the right reasons. And with his portrayal, which also shows some of the positives that can come with Tourette - as opposed to just the obviously stare-inducing drawbacks - I am hopeful that this may help provide the less-aware with a better, more informed presumption about this condition.\n\nAre there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and who are open about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. Like me. But I'm not Edward Norton. And are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and closeted about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. But they are also not Edward Norton.\n\nThe issue of roles going to actors who don't live with the condition being portrayed has been a hot-button issue for many, and I do think there are instances where the role should have gone to someone else. This isn't one of those times. Actors are actors, after all - their job is to convince you that they're not pretending.\n\nEdward was convincing. And I - and I imagine a number of others with Tourette Syndrome who have been subject to unfair or illegal treatment due, at least in part, to a sub-par late '90s movie - thank him for being so. I was fortunate enough to see this at TIFF this year, where he introduced the film. Had he stayed for a Q&amp;A afterwards, I would have loved to have said this to him in person. But I doubt I am the first, and know I won't be the last, person to say this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few. Adonis "Donny" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series. Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies. On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out. Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle. Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason. In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":421122,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Add to that some Extreme Close Ups and all Sense of What Goes On is Lost in a Placebo of Adrenaline.\n\nThe Film's Locations are Anything but Exotic, more like Third World Infomercials that are Used to Adopt a Hungry Child. This is a Rather Boring Bond and is about as Unexciting as a Bond could be. Given the Backstory and the Historical Template and Oodles of Money it has just Enough Empathy from Fans to Tolerate this Dull Delivery, but just Barely.\n\nThe Title is one of the Worst for a Bond Film, as is the Opening Trademark Song, and Overall One gets the Feeling that They are in Disdain for the Character's Attributes and the Coolness that made Bond Survive over 20 Movies, 5 Actors, and 5 Decades. Its Acceptable to Modernize a Bit, Tweak a Little, and bring a Slightly New Artistic Touch, but not at the Expense of the Root Material.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":411738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Add to that some Extreme Close Ups and all Sense of What Goes On is Lost in a Placebo of Adrenaline.\n\nThe Film's Locations are Anything but Exotic, more like Third World Infomercials that are Used to Adopt a Hungry Child. This is a Rather Boring Bond and is about as Unexciting as a Bond could be. Given the Backstory and the Historical Template and Oodles of Money it has just Enough Empathy from Fans to Tolerate this Dull Delivery, but just Barely.\n\nThe Title is one of the Worst for a Bond Film, as is the Opening Trademark Song, and Overall One gets the Feeling that They are in Disdain for the Character's Attributes and the Coolness that made Bond Survive over 20 Movies, 5 Actors, and 5 Decades. Its Acceptable to Modernize a Bit, Tweak a Little, and bring a Slightly New Artistic Touch, but not at the Expense of the Root Material.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":411738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare.

Sean plays the comedic, smooth, and witty Bond to perfection while Daniel plays the mysterious, dark, and lonesome secret agent flawlessly. I will always choose a darker portrayal over a comedic one because it takes a certain mindset to depict someone of that nature. One of my favorite scenes is where Bond is sitting in a bar drinking alone. I don't care who you are or what your background is, if you are drinking by yourself in a bar, then you have issues that are haunting you. Whether you can admit it or not, you are in a dark place and that is exactly where this Daniel Craig portrayed Bond is. And I love it.\n\nAside from Daniel Craig, you have a cast that includes some of the finest actors that have ever graced the big screen. Javier Bardem plays a blood thirsty ex-MI6 agent out for revenge. His performance is equally as creepy and twisted as his portrayal of Anton Chigurh in "No Country for Old Men" and it is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney give important and memorable roles which I won't go further into detail about. Also two prominent figures from James bond history find their way back into the story line. Sam Mendes shows why he was the right choice to direct a film of this magnitude and along with the contribution of Oscar Nominee John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade come up with a memorable narrative after the disappointment of their last collaborating effort, Quantum of Solace. \n\nI look forward to what the future has in store for everyone's favorite spy. If Skyfall is a sign of things to come, then I will remain incredibly optimistic about the future.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":641399,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But the writing is the true star here. Kelley certainly knows how to put a series together, but this feels like new ground for him.

No, dok je Joe zauzet izbjegavanjem svoje prošlosti, ona ga sustiže u obliku misterioznog ruskog obavještajca koji tvrdi da je agent koji radi za Joeova strica Boba (William Hurt).

Joe nerado pomaže - ne želi imati nikakve veze s CIA-om, ali događaji kod kuće prisiljavaju Joea da poduzme mjere i tjeraju ga da se suoči sa životom za koji je mislio da ga je ostavio za sobom.</desc>

U nadi da će osvojiti golem jackpot, prijatelji udružuju novac i kupuju desetke lutrijskih listića. Međutim, prepiru se oko toga kako potrošiti bogatstvo ako dobiju, a Monica iritira sve ostale kupujući listiće samo za sebe i Chandlera. Ogorčena Phoebe uzme posudu sa svim listićima i zaprijeti da će je baciti s balkona. Ostali se pomire, ali golub prestraši Phoebe, zbog čega ona ipak ispusti zdjelu. U međuvremenu Chandler uzbuđeno iščekuje odluku svoje tvrtke o njegovoj budućnosti. A Ross zove Rachel "mamica" kako bi Emmu naučio tu riječ.</desc>

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":528712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Pictures","datePublished":"2002-03-20","description":"Danny Ocean and his ten accomplices plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously.","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0240772/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Buddy-51","dateCreated":"2002-07-27","inLanguage":"English","name":"a pleasant souffle of a film","reviewBody":"Steven Soderbergh's remake of `Ocean's Eleven' is a stylish heist picture featuring some of the brightest stars in moviemaking today.  The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":528712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows. For the rest of us, BSG raised the bar so high, we almost cannot enjoy other SF shows anymore.\n\nBut then... we can always re-watch it, and hope others will learn from it, too.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":157525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-01-14","keywords":"human in outer space,nuclear weapon,totalitarianism,prophecy,space opera","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001579/","name":"Edward James Olmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051397/","name":"Jamie Bamber"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103727/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176813/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue. Whatever the future holds for the show the excellent Colin Morgan has a bright career ahead of him.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue. Whatever the future holds for the show the excellent Colin Morgan has a bright career ahead of him.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
