To me, everything else in the film seems to be subplots or minor characters. Much time is spent on portraying Vatel as a hardworking, bright and noble person. He even knows his subordinates' life history by heart! Vatel's noble virtues contrasts with the corrupted mortals of high social status. The film's dark theme is sometimes overshadowed by the merry atmosphere of the feast. The extravagant sets and amazing costumes are very dazzling. The film is worth the watch just to see the feast scene!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7663,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-05-10","keywords":"murder,fart,defecation,painful defecation,defecating in public","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Vatel","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3369115161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MTBmMGMtMzBkOC00YzFjLWI3YjQtMzkzNDc3ZjNlZDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MTBmMGMtMzBkOC00YzFjLWI3YjQtMzkzNDc3ZjNlZDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000235/","name":"Uma Thurman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0423646/","name":"Roland Joffé"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011185/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479738/","name":"Jeanne Labrune"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001779/","name":"Tom Stoppard"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To me, everything else in the film seems to be subplots or minor characters. Much time is spent on portraying Vatel as a hardworking, bright and noble person. He even knows his subordinates' life history by heart! Vatel's noble virtues contrasts with the corrupted mortals of high social status. The film's dark theme is sometimes overshadowed by the merry atmosphere of the feast. The extravagant sets and amazing costumes are very dazzling. The film is worth the watch just to see the feast scene!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7663,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-05-10","keywords":"murder,fart,defecation,painful defecation,defecating in public","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Vatel","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3369115161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MTBmMGMtMzBkOC00YzFjLWI3YjQtMzkzNDc3ZjNlZDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MTBmMGMtMzBkOC00YzFjLWI3YjQtMzkzNDc3ZjNlZDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000235/","name":"Uma Thurman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0423646/","name":"Roland Joffé"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011185/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006888/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479738/","name":"Jeanne Labrune","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001779/","name":"Tom Stoppard"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Last year, the highlight of the festival for me was American Beauty.  This year, it would have to be (so far) Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".\n\nBeing of Asian descent, I've seen my share of wu xia genre movies to last me a life time.  However, most of them are so centred on the fighting, that they forget the rest of the elements that are involed.  The movie turns into one long scripted fighting scene with maybe a slight hint of story. Crouching Tiger, on the other hand realizes these issues, and builds these oh-so entertaining action sequences into an epic with typical asian themes such as true love and honour.\n\nBeing an epic, one would expect the usual long takes and establishing shots, and boy does it ever look beautiful.  Traversing through a myriad of regions spanning the lengh of China (from the deserts to bamboo forests, to mountains high in the clouds), the film soley based on its asthetic properties is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour.  And then there's the cinemetography.  Wow!  The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous.  If your jaw dropped when you saw Rome and its coliseum in Gladiator, wait until you see ancient Beijing recreated on the screen!\n\nOkay, so it's a good looking movie.  What about the story?  The complexity of the plot is rather sparse, probably reminiscent of epics such as Braveheart or Gladiator, which is by no means a bad thing.  Although both Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeo did have major parts, this movie belongs mostly to Zhang Ziyi who IMHO did an amazing job playing a very complex role (one which required her to represent nobily as a princess, naivness, as well as show inner strength).  Mainly concentrating on her unwillingness to give in to the ideals of an arranged marriage, the decently written script adds a story of an old warrior trying to retire and a 300+ year old sword.\n\nAll in all, this film blends story, well choreographed action, and a stylistic eye to create a mythilogical piece that not only represents the wu xia genre justly by doing it well, but also contributes to raising the quality of filmmaking usually applied in the making of a similar type of film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260429,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Neve Campbell, Denise Richards (surprisingly), and especially Matt Dillion turn in very good performances. I always enjoy Bill Murray and his part in this movie, although fairly small, adds some levity.\n\nI can't comment too much on this movie without spoiling it, except to say that things aren't always what they expect to be. There are a lot of plot twists, some that probably couldn't stand tremendous scrutiny, but are realistic enough to keep the audience engaged.\n\nThe other technical aspects of the movie - direction and cinematography - are done very well, too. That is, they are unobtrusive.\n\nThis really is a thoroughly entertaining film, and while it does contain one rather steamy scene, is not a cheap sex film, but a well-thought out, well-executed story.

Neve Campbell, Denise Richards (surprisingly), and especially Matt Dillion turn in very good performances. I always enjoy Bill Murray and his part in this movie, although fairly small, adds some levity.\n\nI can't comment too much on this movie without spoiling it, except to say that things aren't always what they expect to be. There are a lot of plot twists, some that probably couldn't stand tremendous scrutiny, but are realistic enough to keep the audience engaged.\n\nThe other technical aspects of the movie - direction and cinematography - are done very well, too. That is, they are unobtrusive.\n\nThis really is a thoroughly entertaining film, and while it does contain one rather steamy scene, is not a cheap sex film, but a well-thought out, well-executed story. I highly recommend it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114413,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1998-03-20","keywords":"erotic thriller,lesbian sex,taboo sex,sex with a student,lesbian kiss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wild Things","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3053256985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ4NzA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyMTg2MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ4NzA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyMTg2MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000117/","name":"Neve Campbell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0573796/","name":"John McNaughton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002983/","name":"Stephen Peters"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All elements of film making seemed to work, for me. I like realism in films and the sense of isolation in the Australian outback was palpable. After viewing the trailer for Wolf Creek 2 I thought that the film might fall into the Hollywood category. What I was hoping for was another gem.\n\nJohn Jarratt returns as serial killer Mick Taylor. He delivers another strong performance. His laugh and hoarse, Aussie voice never falter. He gets totally into character and runs the show. He has too much screen time, however, to make him as scary as he should be. The viewer is given too much knowledge of his whereabouts, I felt.\n\nThe actors who play the tourists are good, notably Ryan Corr, playing well-educated British traveler, Paul. The film doesn't provide much insight into his character which might be the reason why I had little empathy for him, or any of Mick's victims in this film. Towards the end I was routing for the tourists solely because as the viewer we have witnessed the hell their put through. For whatever reason, I really liked the characters in the first film and it was hard to watch them meet their fate.\n\nThe sense of isolation is there but doesn't have the same effect as it did in the first film, probably because there are a few more characters in this film, and other devices used to create action, which made the film appear less chilling and more thrilling.\n\nI liked that McLean used subtitles for the German couple because I wasn't expecting it. Of course English isn't always going to be a tourists first language and they're not going to speak it for our benefit. Fret not, once the screaming begins you don't have to do a lot of reading.\n\nSome parts of the film felt a little odd to me at first, and there are a couple of comical sequences. I took it in the movie's stride. Perhaps that was writer number 2, Aaron Sterns, input. I didn't mind. There was enough Mick Taylor sadism to pull me back to the horror film I went in to watch. The setting at the end was a little disappointing because it felt too orchestrated and unlike Mick Taylor. It felt more like a scene from 'Hostel'. \n\nThe first film is a rare beauty, and Wolf Creek 2 is a good sequel - nothing more, nothing less IMO.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-02-20","keywords":"characters murdered one by one,psychopathic murderer,slasher murderer,tourist,crime spree","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wolf Creek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1774303769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Wolf Creek 2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418877/","name":"John Jarratt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1507708/","name":"Ryan Corr"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590140/","name":"Shannon Ashlyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036887/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048683/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1846103/","name":"Aaron Sterns"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All elements of film making seemed to work, for me. I like realism in films and the sense of isolation in the Australian outback was palpable. After viewing the trailer for Wolf Creek 2 I thought that the film might fall into the Hollywood category. What I was hoping for was another gem.\n\nJohn Jarratt returns as serial killer Mick Taylor. He delivers another strong performance. His laugh and hoarse, Aussie voice never falter. He gets totally into character and runs the show. He has too much screen time, however, to make him as scary as he should be. The viewer is given too much knowledge of his whereabouts, I felt.\n\nThe actors who play the tourists are good, notably Ryan Corr, playing well-educated British traveler, Paul. The film doesn't provide much insight into his character which might be the reason why I had little empathy for him, or any of Mick's victims in this film. Towards the end I was routing for the tourists solely because as the viewer we have witnessed the hell their put through. For whatever reason, I really liked the characters in the first film and it was hard to watch them meet their fate.\n\nThe sense of isolation is there but doesn't have the same effect as it did in the first film, probably because there are a few more characters in this film, and other devices used to create action, which made the film appear less chilling and more thrilling.\n\nI liked that McLean used subtitles for the German couple because I wasn't expecting it. Of course English isn't always going to be a tourists first language and they're not going to speak it for our benefit. Fret not, once the screaming begins you don't have to do a lot of reading.\n\nSome parts of the film felt a little odd to me at first, and there are a couple of comical sequences. I took it in the movie's stride. Perhaps that was writer number 2, Aaron Sterns, input. I didn't mind. There was enough Mick Taylor sadism to pull me back to the horror film I went in to watch. The setting at the end was a little disappointing because it felt too orchestrated and unlike Mick Taylor. It felt more like a scene from 'Hostel'. \n\nThe first film is a rare beauty, and Wolf Creek 2 is a good sequel - nothing more, nothing less IMO.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-02-20","keywords":"characters murdered one by one,psychopathic murderer,slasher murderer,tourist,crime spree","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wolf Creek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1774303769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Wolf Creek 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418877/","name":"John Jarratt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1507708/","name":"Ryan Corr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590140/","name":"Shannon Ashlyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036887/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048683/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1846103/","name":"Aaron Sterns"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Comte de Gonzague schemes against his cousin, the Duc de Nevers, even though he is the Duke's heir and will inherit his estates. The Count has kept secret the existence of the Duke's bastard, recently born. When the Duke learns of his child, he journeys to wed the mother, a baron's daughter, in her father's isolated chateau.

The Duc of Nevers is a dashing nobleman who's cousin wishes him gone in order to inherit his fortune.  His cousin, Count Gonzague pays hired swords to kill Nevers but they fail to do so, one of the men winning over the Duc and becoming his friend.  When Nevers learns he has a child from an one night stand in Caylus, he sets off with Langardère to be married.  However the marriage occurs but men attack the castle and Langardère is left to flee and protect the baby.  He joins a group of players and hides for 20 years.  However when the baby (now grown up as the beautiful Aurore) kills a man in the style known only to her father, Nevers, her presence is revealed and Langardère is forced to put things in motion for his revenge.\n\nI have had this film sitting on a video tape for a month waiting for me to get some time to watch it.  I am always put off by foreign films and often they will go to the bottom of things I have to watch simply due to the subtitles!  I saw this today and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The plot is quite simple although it sounds quite complex.  The two acts are  I, Langardère and Nevers becoming friends before the deeds and II, Langardère returning to Paris 20 years later.  The plot is helped to move along by the energetic playful feel to the film.  It has it's tongue slightly in it's cheek but not so much as to make a mockery of the story.  Instead it has just enough wit to stop it feeling historic or creaky.\n\nIt is not without flaws however, but they are minor when viewed alongside the grand sweep of the film.  I, for one, didn't totally get behind the switch in the type of love between Langardère and Aurore  it was too easy after 20 years.  Aside from this, the wit enables the film to get by with unlikely plot devices  if the subject had been presented drier then I may have had a problem with it.\n\nThe cast is led by some great performances, none more so than Auteuil.  He is good both as the angry young man who befriends Nevers, the comical hero, the protective heroic father and the hunchback of the title.  He has great fun in all roles and he is fun to watch.  Perez is a bit of a cad and is enjoyable while onscreen and Luchini is a good villain made comical by his almost `middle manager' sense of insecurity and being second best all the time!  Gillain as the adult Aurore is pretty and it is only her romance of Langardère that didn't work for me.\n\nOverall this is a very enjoyable film. The plot is very traditional and well worn, but the film is really helped by it's energy and wit that helps everything flow that much easier and makes, along with good performances, for a very fun film to watch."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3455,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1997-12-03","keywords":"france,period drama,1700s,disguise,adventure hero","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1843903769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkxN2FiNzgtYmZkZC00Mjk2LWI2NjAtOGQ5NDhmNWI4OGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkxN2FiNzgtYmZkZC00Mjk2LWI2NjAtOGQ5NDhmNWI4OGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000809/","name":"Daniel Auteuil"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001641/","name":"Vincent Perez"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003606/","name":"Philippe de Broca"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012976/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037028/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003606/","name":"Philippe de Broca"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299692/","name":"Paul Féval"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But those who opposed California becoming a state in the Union are planning a new threat that might change their plans.\n\nThe Mask Of Zorro was a pretty good film. The sequel isn't as good yet it's still enjoyable. I personally would rather have the PG-13 rating but surprisingly the sequel didn't actually suck. I have to give credit to the cast and director. Martin Campbell knows how to direct action and he made this film very entertaining to watch. The story is a little weak and there isn't really anything new to found here but the action makes up for that.\n\nThe acting is solid just like the first one. Antonio Banderas takes the role of Zorro again and he does a good job. Catherine Zeta Jones returns as Elena and she also does a pretty good job. These two have a lot of chemistry together and they are interesting to watch on screen. The new addition to the cast and the person who almost ruined the film is Adrian Alonso. He plays Joaquin, the son of Zorro and Elena. He has a few funny lines but for the most part, he is really annoying. His role should have been cut since he almost ruined the entire movie.\n\nMany people are complaining that the new rating kills the film and I disagree. The fight scenes are tamer and safer when compared to the original. He actually doesn't really use his sword to kill nor is much blood shown. However, the fight scenes are still pretty good and there are a lot of entertaining scenes like the train scene at the end. There were some boring scenes but they didn't last long. Also, the film is really cheesy and some of this does get annoying, nothing too major though. In the end, if you expect something like the original movie than you will end up disappointed. However, if you want something in the vein of National Treasure, a safe family action film, then this sequel is for you and it can really be enjoyed by adults too.

It has been called "plodding," "stale," and "uninspired," thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....\n\nFirst, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.\n\nHaving said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.\n\nIf you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called "overly-long exposition" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.\n\nCritics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.\n\nI think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.\n\nIn short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the "truth", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.\n\nIf you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.\n\nThe bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.\n\nMy advice: go see for yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":414398,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"self flagellation,conspiracy,bare butt male,self punishment,bound and gagged","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Da Vinci Code","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2369847833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this conspiracy thriller starring Tom Hanks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124737/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467010/","name":"Dan Brown"}],"duration":"PT2H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).\n\nI enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.\n\nI don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.\n\nLet's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a "Jekyll and Hyde"-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Danny escapes his troubles in the adrenaline-pumping fantasies of the cinema, especially the JACK SLATER film series.\n\nThe JACK SLATER movies spoof the action franchises popular at the time, like DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON. Jack Slater is the ultimate badass, working for the LAPD but doing things his own way. Chomping on cigars, kicking down doors. Going where other cops wouldn't dare.\n\nIn the film, the star of the JACK SLATER series is real-world action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is LAST ACTION HERO's biggest meta concept as Schwarzenegger stars as a parody of himself (playing both Arnold and Arnold-as-Jack).\n\nWith the help of an enchanted ticket given to Nick by the famed escape artist Harry Houdini, Danny is able to enter the world of the newest JACK SLATER movie and help Jack beat the bad guys. It should be a dream come true, but instead of just going along with it, Danny tries to shatter Jack's worldview by proving that he "lives" in a fictional movie universe, full of improbable explosions, predictable one-liners, and physics-defying stunts. Danny calls out Jack for using well-known Arnold catchphrases like "I'll be back" and tries to explain the absurdity of Jack's LAPD colleague being an animated anthropomorphic cat (voiced by Danny DeVito). Jack thinks Danny's crazy (obviously), but Danny's uncanny knowledge of secret information (gleaned from watching prior installments of the JACK SLATER series, as well as the opening scenes from this one) gets him assigned as Jack's partner, in true buddy movie fashion.\n\nDanny is always completely self-aware about being the comic sidekick in an action movie. He knows Jack Slater's world is governed by plot contrivances and movie clichés. He even calls out the villain for monologuing. Austin O'Brien doesn't do a bad job in the film, but he does start to get on my nerves a little.\n\nThe fun really starts once the villain (Charles Dance) gets ahold of the magic ticket and enters the real world, a place where heroes can bleed and bad guys can actually win. Jack and Danny track him to the star-studded premiere of JACK SLATER IV, where fictional hero Jack Slater comes face-to-face with Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger (among other fun celebrity cameos).\n\nThe satire of LAST ACTION HERO is on-point. Besides getting Arnold Schwarzenegger to spoof himself, the movie is directed by John McTiernan, who directed DIE HARD (1988), and the screenplay was co-written by Shane Black, who wrote LETHAL WEAPON (1987). The top-notch pedigree surely helps sell the film's high concept.\n\nThe script has a lot of potential for the right actor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger seems like he's having a lot of fun with the material. It wouldn't be the same without a real A-list action star playing Jack Slater. Arnold has a good sense of humor about himself and seems to enjoy playing with his image.\n\nOne of the best in-jokes for serious movie buffs comes early in the film when Danny's English teacher, played by Joan Plowright, introduces a clip from Laurence Olivier's HAMLET (1948), suggesting that the students might know the British acting legend from his late-career role of Zeus in CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) or an older TV commercial for Polaroid. Plowright is, of course, Olivier's widow.\n\nIn addition to HAMLET, the movie includes nods to Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957), Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA_(1992), and WITNESS (1985) with Harrison Ford. In the movie world Danny warns Jack not to trust his FBI buddy John Practice because he is played by F. Murray Abraham, the guy who "killed Mozart" (an allusion to AMADEUS (1984)). A Humphrey Bogart-type detective in a trench coat appears in one of the JACK SLATER police station scenes. And since "Arnold Schwarzenegger" can't exist in the fictional world of Jack Slater, his famous role in the TERMINATOR films is played instead by Sylvester Stallone.\n\nThe JACK SLATER action is hilariously over-the-top and stylized, satirizing Hollywood action blockbusters and further contrasting the fantasy world of the silver screen with the real world Danny knows. The original story, developed by Zak Penn and Adam Leff, is quite clever and the film, unconventional as it is, succeeds because of its uniqueness. The movie's a lot of fun and there are plenty of Easter eggs for hardcore cinephiles."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1993-06-18","keywords":"villain,taxi,funeral,video store,child drives a car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Last Action Hero","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1823080729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlMTc2NWMtZTMyNy00MWJjLWFjMTAtZGRmMjQ4ODAwYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlMTc2NWMtZTMyNy00MWJjLWFjMTAtZGRmMjQ4ODAwYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000719/","name":"F.

The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the 'value' of war, of its worth. It's pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?\n\nPro or con?\n\nWhat is interesting is that since the Second World War, this underlying message that is found in nearly all war pictures has slowly changed from the former to the latter. This again is generally shaped in two ways. Either we see the play-by-play results following the issuance of what appears to be a bizarre and foolhardy set of orders from high command (i.e., APOCALYPSE NOW or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). Or we get a glimpse of being right in the action as it all falls apart: hearing the bullets whizzing past our noses, reeling from the impact of RPG's and gazing blankly as the bodies begin to mount (PLATOON, say). BLACK HAWK DOWN, directed by Ridley Scott and accurately following the true story of the best-selling book by Mark Bowden, very much adopts the latter perspective.\n\nOn October 3, 1993, a small unit of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were dropped by helicopter into hostile territory in Mogadishu, Somalia, with what is perceived to be a straightforward mission: the capture of two lieutenants of the Somali warlord, General Aidid. The unit is under command from Major William Garrison (Sam Shepard), and headed by Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) in his first direct experience of frontline leadership. He also has a personal goal - to ensure everyone comes back alive.\n\nYet, these things are never as easy as they appear - hence the development of the book and the film - and when 18-year old frontline rookie Todd Blackbird is injured early on, the entire mission begins to fall apart. More U.S. troops are injured, and when Somalis down two Black Hawk helicopters, the mission changes completely: it's now a rescue operation.\n\nAnd for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see. Remember the Omaha Beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? That was about half an hour long. Think of something three times that length, yet more 'realistic' and with (thankfully) no flag-waving. That is the gist of BLACK HAWK DOWN.\n\nUltimately, one hundred-and-twenty-three U.S. troops were involved in the Mogadishu conflict. Nineteen were killed, and one thousand Somalis also perished.\n\nUnlike RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN doesn't build up a core group of characters, focusing on their emotional makeup and depth. No. Instead, we barely know our 'heroes', with very little time devoted to each characters motivation or purpose. And this is a good thing. At first, you find yourself a little bewildered by the sizeable cast, and this isn't helped by the many distant POV scenes that found this reviewer wondering just who he was seeing living and dying. But surely that is an important and crucial element of war - you're involved in these suicidal missions with men you barely know. You don't have time to share your life-stories. You may have only met that week, that day, or within the last hour. And then it's full on.\n\nWe get snippets of character data: Eversmann's entire focus is on not letting the team down; Specialist Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), for so long tied to his desk simply because he excelled at typing; and Delta Sergeant 'Hoot' Hooten (Tom Sizemore, soon to be playing Bruce Banner in THE HULK), wise despite his years, somehow making more sense of the nonsense than anyone else.\n\nBut any characterisation is underplayed and to the point, which is how it should be. The fresh-facedness and naivety of the troops is key to the success of the film, and of the emotional impact therein. As the errors and bodies mount, we get to see the horror of the conflict - the carnage and devastation, relentlessness and never-ending waves of Somali forces - directly through the eyes of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force squad. I was somewhat stunned by the impact of the movie, both in the way the action grips you and shakes you violently until you want to let go, and in the occasional and very touching soft moments. Indeed, the action is so intense that I found myself at times glazing over, thinking of something else, and with hindsight I put this down to some kind of need for an emotional release; certainly, I cannot fault the film in that sense. It was simply a case of 'too much.'\n\nThroughout the movie both the acting and direction are superb; Ridley Scott has an eye for detail and filmography that is probably unmatched. Even his lesser efforts like HANNIBAL are beautifully shot. And BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of his best efforts to date.\n\nThe musical score is also superb, and I was encouraged to hear the Stone Temple Pilot's CREEP near the beginning of the flick. I believe this is the first time I have heard a STP song in any movie.\n\nWhat is also very welcome is the lack of U.S. nationalism in this picture. Of America saving the day. Unlike, say, brother Tony Scott's TOP GUN - which yes, was making a different point entirely (i.e., let's make some money and recruit some boys to the Navy at the same time) - this isn't about the might of the U.S. There is no wake-leaving in BLACK HAWK DOWN. Real people made mistakes, and real people died.\n\nSpeaking of Tony Scott, however, my only minor quibble was Sam Shepard's performance. He was probably in the wrong movie, as all his mannerisms (especially the way he took off his sunglasses in that quick-draw kind of way that stereotypical military types always seem to do) appeared to me to come straight out of TOP GUN. He was a little too 'bleh' for my tastes. For all I know William Garrison could have been exactly like that, but it still seemed a little Hollywood.\n\nI also wasn't completely comfortable as to how the Somalis were portrayed; this movie wasn't really about good versus bad in my opinion, but on the face of it the U.S. are the bad guys here. At least inasmuch as they were at fault. Comparisons are made with Vietnam both in the unnecessary involvement of the U.S. in the Somali civil war, and in the end credits of the film where we learn that the Medal of Honour was awarded to two U.S. soldiers for the first time since the Vietnam conflict. Yet, throughout the film the Somali are seen in only two ways - either a relentless force of bloodthirsty killers, or a simple people trying to stay out of the way. Now yes, this may be what it really was like - I cannot say because I wasn't there - but the overall message didn't fit well with me. They seemed too one-dimensional, a bit TOO bloodthirsty, and that left a bitter taste.\n\nAlso as mentioned above the film is often confusing during the extended battle scene, and warrants more than one view. As the blood and dirt begins to pile, you will find yourself wondering who you are looking at, particularly when the perspective is on several soldiers from a distance. But that can be forgiven. This isn't PREDATOR, and while that film is outstanding as a piece of science fiction, it made a great effort to separate the marines so that the viewer would have an easy time following each one.\n\nThat, of course, isn't real life, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is, perhaps, as close as we've come yet to an accurate capture of the true feel of war.\n\nRating: **** 1/2 (out of five)"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":376688,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. soldier,u.s. army,gunfight,street shootout","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The storyline has a twisted plot and the final has an extraordinary surprise.\n\nThe flick is inspired by Agatha Christie's classic novel : ¨Ten little indians¨ that has several cinematic adaptations.\n\nIn the movie there is suspense , thriller, noisy action , emotion and a little bit gore when the assassinations happen.\n\nAll the cast is nice, but interpretations from Rebecca Mornay and Pruitt Taylor Vince are specially riveting . Alan Silvestri musical score and Papamichael cinematography are atmospheric and adequate. It was shot on a huge sound stage at Sony studios in Culver City . Decent direction by the notable filmmaker James Mangold (Logan, Walk the line , Kate and Leopold, Heavy). \n\nRating 7/10 , above average","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":234925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-06-11","keywords":"motel room key,dissociative identity disorder,motel,storm,murder","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Identity","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi848363801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjYzg0MGUtMWMzOS00ZjJmLThiNjctOGM3YWMxOGVhZmM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjYzg0MGUtMWMzOS00ZjJmLThiNjctOGM3YWMxOGVhZmM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000131/","name":"John Cusack","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000501/","name":"Ray Liotta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001605/","name":"Amanda Peet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010901/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177769/","name":"Michael Cooney"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot . This is all well and good but illustrates the fact highly regarded novels often don't lend themselves to great cinema .

All the talent in these older actors and actresses and it's being wasted by far too many tasteless, unfunny, crude movies that you either do not want to see, or if you are foolish enough to be roped into attending, you regret with every inch of your soul. In this one, each and every part was cast to perfection. A plot that made sense, fully fleshed out characters you like, and just fun, fun, fun. Tell you, there were more people in the matinée my friends and I went to see than for any movie we can remember seeing in a long time. And all of us left the show smiling. This one is a keeper. Would actually love to see a sequel to this, set a year or so ahead. I can think of several older actors/actresses to be in the film, in addition to these delightful players. I'm hoping Hollywood is paying attention. Sometimes they do it right and use the real talent. The Best Oriental Marigold Hotel was one. Quartet was one. I could name a few more, too. And this is one.

All the talent in these older actors and actresses and it's being wasted by far too many tasteless, unfunny, crude movies that you either do not want to see, or if you are foolish enough to be roped into attending, you regret with every inch of your soul. In this one, each and every part was cast to perfection. A plot that made sense, fully fleshed out characters you like, and just fun, fun, fun. Tell you, there were more people in the matinée my friends and I went to see than for any movie we can remember seeing in a long time. And all of us left the show smiling. This one is a keeper. Would actually love to see a sequel to this, set a year or so ahead. I can think of several older actors/actresses to be in the film, in addition to these delightful players. I'm hoping Hollywood is paying attention. Sometimes they do it right and use the real talent. The Best Oriental Marigold Hotel was one. Quartet was one. I could name a few more, too. And this is one.

In modern parlance, WTF? \n\nBut periodically, just occasionally, once in a while, he inhabits the screen in a manner that forces one to reconsider one's judgment. And so it is with The Homesman.\n\nThe Homesman is something of a surprise, and not just because Tommy Lee Jones is on remarkable form in it. Beyond a fine performance, the man writes, directs and co-produces it. Hell's bells, when did he become so damn good at everything? \n\nIn the bad old days of the pioneers in the Wild West, Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) steps in when three women drift into various states of madness and need to be transported across the country to be cared for properly. Shunned by their husbands, denied help from the town's menfolk and at a time where rape and murder hides behind every outcrop of rock and every gnarled cactus, Cuddy sets off alone on her hazardous journey. She stumbles across George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones), a drifter seated atop his horse, with a noose around his neck, waiting for his steed to grow bored and leave him hanging. Literally. Cuddy offers to save him on the condition that he accompanies her and so begins a particular kind of journey.\n\nThe Homesman is probably described by many as a western, but that's lazy. This is a road movie on horseback, a saunter across the plains, a journey through mistrust and emotions where a mistake or misplaced trust will result in death. It is a story of hope and love, not the romantic kind, but real love for one's fellow human being, regardless of whether they can, or will, reciprocate.\n\nShot beautifully with sprawling, dusty vistas that warm the heart and prickle the nape, the backdrop is a vast canvas of character and mystery upon which splashes of colour are smeared in the shape of wandering, human dangers.\n\nThough they say little, the trio of women (Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto and Sonja Richter) are far more than peripheral characters or the MacGuffin; they are the substance that binds The Homesman and the reason for the drama, gentle though it is. As we saw in Mr. Turner, such characters can so easily become pantomime animals with over performance that slaps the viewer in the face and detracts from the whole, of which they are but a small part. Not so here. Grace Gummer, particularly, as the mostly mute but vacantly animated Arabella is terrific and we want to reach into the screen and gently push her back towards sanity. It is a beautiful, understated performance that remains in mind long after the event.\n\nTommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank make a surprising double act but the chemistry is there in abundance. Both Cuddy and Briggs carry their own needs and daemons with them; neither would give the other a second glance ordinarily but circumstance prompts odd, emotional couplings and theirs is fraught with suspicion and obligation. It is fantastic to see Swank back to the form that brought her gongs and made us sit up and watch in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby. This is a far less demonstrative performance, but no less steely or impactful because of it.\n\nTommy Lee Jones's performance is the most compelling, engrossing that I can recall. Beyond that, his direction is worth celebrating loudly. The Homesman is only his second feature as director (after 2006's wonderful but little seen The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) but there are hints that he may step into Clint Eastwood's shoes alongside Ben Affleck and Sean Penn. Just when we think we have the measure of this tale, he belts us sharply around the jowls, proving he has the mettle to surprise and shock us out of our complacency.\n\nMaybe, after years and years of apparently coasting, broodily on film and staring into space, it will transpire he was merely absorbing, waiting for the moment to own both sides of the screen and captivate us.\n\nYou know what, maybe he's always been this good but I just didn't see it.\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32039,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"2014-05-18","keywords":"suicide by hanging,suicide,driven insane,abusive marriage,hanging","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1203089177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTE3NTgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxMDk2MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTE3NTgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxMDk2MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When three women living on the edge of the American frontier are driven mad by harsh pioneer life, the task of saving them falls to the pious, independent-minded Mary Bee Cuddy.

A 3/5 from me sadly for the movie and for all the Jobs and Apple fans this is a must watch. However I would suggest you read the book before going to the movie.

George Falconer, Colin's character in "A Single Man" seems to me the flip side of Adrian Leduc, Colin's character in "Apartment Zero". George has had a real life and grieves the death of his companion. Adrian Leduc never had a companion and his grief is based on his total inability to connect with people. George believes that human connection is at the center of everything and puts that thought into practice. Adrian worships James Dean, George doesn't think that much of James Dean, he actually says it. Adrian wears white shirts made of cheap material and he launders them himself. George wears impeccably cut white shirts that he has professionally laundered. They seem tiny details but they become overwhelming when you know both characters. George even hurts himself and wears a band aid just like Adrian during the last 15 minutes of "Apartment Zero" I love Colin Firth because he's an actor that can give you so much doing, seemingly, so little. It compel us to participate and include our own thoughts and feelings. The love of George for his lover is as pungent and real as anything I've ever seen on the screen. It is a cinematic triumph and as I'm writing about it I feel a sort of urge to see it again, just as it happened to me when I saw "Apartment Zero" for the first time. I felt then that Colin deserved an Oscar nomination for Adrian, he will get it for George. This is the first comment I ever wrote and it comes out of a profound need to share this emotion.

There's plenty of jeopardy but scarcely any gore. I guess its most accurately described as a Gothic romance.\n\nIt's a loose riff off Poe's "The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether" with a few canny twists.\n\nThe cast is stellar: Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, Kate Beckinsale, Sinead Cusak.\n\nI tend to define films in terms of whether or not I would enjoy watching them with my undoubtedly better half. in this case, yes.

Because it doesn't have a single one. And it's a fine film.\n\nI think it's somewhat miss-sold as a horror, though it's hard to know how else it should have been marketed. There's plenty of jeopardy but scarcely any gore. I guess its most accurately described as a Gothic romance.\n\nIt's a loose riff off Poe's "The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether" with a few canny twists.\n\nThe cast is stellar: Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, Kate Beckinsale, Sinead Cusak.\n\nI tend to define films in terms of whether or not I would enjoy watching them with my undoubtedly better half. in this case, yes. It's a cracking film with a rattling storyline, The odd proto- feminist moment and no horror cheap shots.

This is in the running to be my favorite movie of all time. This movie can be hard to follow, and can seem vulgar at times, but in reality the dialogue has a higher purpose: to illustrate how we can get lost in our personal objectives and lose track of the bigger picture.

The real life story is honest but also positive.\n\nI personally did not find anything wrong with the movie, it's message, its direction, its acting, etc.\n\nThe only reason I think it's an 8/10 is because of me: I'm a grown up and not a parent. Still I rated it 10/10 because I don't understand the current 5.1 rating.

JJ now has to spy on mother Kate (Parise Fitz-Henley) and her young daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman) in the hope that her arms trade partner contacts his family.

This aspect has come up before in other films such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Kindergarden Cop. For people familiar with such films, this film can quickly become predictable. The script clearly shows the bond between JJ and young Sophie, but the film concentrates a bit too much on this band at a time. For example, the aspect of the secret arms trade is somewhat canceled.

Dave Bautista comes across as a budding CIA agent who doesn't yet know how to best handle his job. While it seems a bit unbelievable that the CIA is discovered by a nine-year-old girl and she manages to outsmart them, these moments make for the best comedy in the movie. For a novice young actress, Chloe Coleman does good and appropriate acting in this film.

Until that premiered much was talked about, first Oscar buzz was all over this movie, people seemed to see Nicole Kidman as a lock for the Best Actress category and since it was directed by La Vie en Rose director Olivier Dahan and with a powerful producer like Harvey Weinstein backing the movie up, well it seemed like we could expect great things from it. This was until the movie was delayed from Cannes 2013 and the fights between the directors cut and Weinstein started, and well this went on for basically a whole year with the movie being postponed several times and with a lot of controversy on top of it as well. The movie finally premiered at Cannes 2014, it was the opening movie and the directors cut was shown and the Weinstein name doesn't even appear on screen when the movie starts. The reviews bashed the movie, many said that it was unforgettable because it was the worst Cannes opener they had ever seen. And although the movie has only been released for about a month, everybody seems to have already forgotten it, well i still had interest in seeing it, i mean how bad could it actually be?\n\nGrace of Monaco is Directed by Olivier Dahan and it stars Nicole Kidman, Milo Ventimiglia, Paz Vega, Tim Roth, Parker Posey, Frank Langella, Derek Jacobi, Geraldine Somerville and Roger Ashton- Griffiths. "The story of former Hollywood star Grace Kelly's crisis of marriage and identity, during a political dispute between Monaco's Prince Rainier III and France's Charles De Gaulle, and a looming French invasion of Monaco in the early 1960s."\n\nWell Grace of Monaco is not a straight up F movie, the movie does have it's redeeming things but for a movie that had such big buzz, for a movie that has such talent involved(in and out of camera), i got to say that this is still an incredibly flawed movie and very disappointing indeed.\n\nI think this was a semi-interesting story, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III relationship and her whole adaptation to the her new life was kind of an interesting story, that could be told brilliantly and even earn some awards but this is not that story. I chose that quote from the movie: "The idea of my life as a fairy tale is itself a fairy tale", because basically what the movie presents us is a fairy tale version of actual events, the movie shows us a fairy tale that is quite ludicrous and naive at times but it shows us without being aware of what it is, the story is presented in a very self-serious way. The movie's major flaw is really it's screenplay and direction, the screenplay is totally insane, it's plain stupid at times and basically the director takes this script and tries to make a kind "King Speech" bio-pic.\n\nArash Amel's screenplay is really where it all begins, it's an empty screenplay. So we have Grace Kelly who is having some problems in her marriage, she feels to much pressure being a princess and she feels a disappointment Kelly is really the only character that at times pops out of the screen and it's really because of Kidman, the rest of the characters have nothing to say and when they do the dialogue is dull and incredibly bland. Tim Roth, Paz Vega, Derek Jacobi, Frank Langella are the supporting roles in this movie and their characters simply have no weight, they are boring they really are just cardboard tick. This movie should never had gotten such talented actors for such a weak screenplay.\n\nAnd unfortunately the direction is not any better, with Olivier Dahan giving violent shifts in tone, at times the movie is very but very serious and it tries to focus on Kelly's problems as an artist and at other times it kind of becomes a comedy i mean not only because what's written it's ridiculous but because the approach is not the best either, i mean even the score at times makes it feel like we are watching a comedy. The movie does hit a low point when all the the sudden, we are not watching a Bio-Pic nor a Drama or Comedy but a thriller with spies and sh*t it was at that time that threw the towel down because things had gotten a bit to ridiculous and the movie is really just all over the place tone wise. I mean i also have to mention that all those meeting scenes about whether or not there would be an invasion were really terrible too, i mean just amateurish with no kind of tension or even believability.\n\nNicole Kidman is a great talent and she rally gives her all here but even her was kind of hard to buy as Grace Kelly. She really gives her heart and talent to this movie that didn't really deserve it, her performance is really what kept me watching this movie and she carries it on her back but even her was not nearly enough. The movie does look pretty good for the most part, with some good cinematography and Set-Decoration but i mean that is more or less expected from this kind of period piece.\n\nGrace of Monaco is quite a big fat mess although not as terrible as some said. This is a bad movie no doubt on that, with a disgusting screenplay and direction that's out of hand, still it's elevated by a good lead performance by Kidman who could not save the day.\n\nRating:C-","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19394,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-05-14","keywords":"monaco,1960s,betrayal,charles de gaulle character,alfred hitchcock character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3188107801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A snapshot of a year in the life of Grace Kelly as she strived to reconcile her past and her present, a yearning for a return to the big screen with her newfound role as a mother of two, monarch of a European principality and wife to Prince Ranier III.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672422/","name":"André Penvern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196860/","name":"Olivier Dahan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374957/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362130/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3885069/","name":"Arash Amel"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And although the movie has only been released for about a month, everybody seems to have already forgotten it, well i still had interest in seeing it, i mean how bad could it actually be?\n\nGrace of Monaco is Directed by Olivier Dahan and it stars Nicole Kidman, Milo Ventimiglia, Paz Vega, Tim Roth, Parker Posey, Frank Langella, Derek Jacobi, Geraldine Somerville and Roger Ashton- Griffiths. "The story of former Hollywood star Grace Kelly's crisis of marriage and identity, during a political dispute between Monaco's Prince Rainier III and France's Charles De Gaulle, and a looming French invasion of Monaco in the early 1960s."\n\nWell Grace of Monaco is not a straight up F movie, the movie does have it's redeeming things but for a movie that had such big buzz, for a movie that has such talent involved(in and out of camera), i got to say that this is still an incredibly flawed movie and very disappointing indeed.\n\nI think this was a semi-interesting story, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III relationship and her whole adaptation to the her new life was kind of an interesting story, that could be told brilliantly and even earn some awards but this is not that story. I chose that quote from the movie: "The idea of my life as a fairy tale is itself a fairy tale", because basically what the movie presents us is a fairy tale version of actual events, the movie shows us a fairy tale that is quite ludicrous and naive at times but it shows us without being aware of what it is, the story is presented in a very self-serious way. The movie's major flaw is really it's screenplay and direction, the screenplay is totally insane, it's plain stupid at times and basically the director takes this script and tries to make a kind "King Speech" bio-pic.\n\nArash Amel's screenplay is really where it all begins, it's an empty screenplay. So we have Grace Kelly who is having some problems in her marriage, she feels to much pressure being a princess and she feels a disappointment Kelly is really the only character that at times pops out of the screen and it's really because of Kidman, the rest of the characters have nothing to say and when they do the dialogue is dull and incredibly bland. Tim Roth, Paz Vega, Derek Jacobi, Frank Langella are the supporting roles in this movie and their characters simply have no weight, they are boring they really are just cardboard tick. This movie should never had gotten such talented actors for such a weak screenplay.\n\nAnd unfortunately the direction is not any better, with Olivier Dahan giving violent shifts in tone, at times the movie is very but very serious and it tries to focus on Kelly's problems as an artist and at other times it kind of becomes a comedy i mean not only because what's written it's ridiculous but because the approach is not the best either, i mean even the score at times makes it feel like we are watching a comedy. The movie does hit a low point when all the the sudden, we are not watching a Bio-Pic nor a Drama or Comedy but a thriller with spies and sh*t it was at that time that threw the towel down because things had gotten a bit to ridiculous and the movie is really just all over the place tone wise. I mean i also have to mention that all those meeting scenes about whether or not there would be an invasion were really terrible too, i mean just amateurish with no kind of tension or even believability.\n\nNicole Kidman is a great talent and she rally gives her all here but even her was kind of hard to buy as Grace Kelly. She really gives her heart and talent to this movie that didn't really deserve it, her performance is really what kept me watching this movie and she carries it on her back but even her was not nearly enough. The movie does look pretty good for the most part, with some good cinematography and Set-Decoration but i mean that is more or less expected from this kind of period piece.\n\nGrace of Monaco is quite a big fat mess although not as terrible as some said. This is a bad movie no doubt on that, with a disgusting screenplay and direction that's out of hand, still it's elevated by a good lead performance by Kidman who could not save the day.\n\nRating:C-","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19394,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-05-14","keywords":"monaco,1960s,betrayal,charles de gaulle character,alfred hitchcock character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3188107801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A snapshot of a year in the life of Grace Kelly as she strived to reconcile her past and her present, a yearning for a return to the big screen with her newfound role as a mother of two, monarch of a European principality and wife to Prince Ranier III.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672422/","name":"André Penvern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196860/","name":"Olivier Dahan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374957/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3885069/","name":"Arash Amel"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In spite of my regard for her however, I was a little reluctant to see this movie, due to its association as a religious movie. In the end my regard for Britt won over and I took the plunge. I need not have been concerned as the religious content was very subtle and was perfectly within the context of the story. This is easily Britt Robertson's best performance to date and the way she interacted with K.J.Apa was remarkable. You could really feel the bond between them which by all accounts was genuine and it showed in the excellent performances from both of them. This is a very moving film and anyone who doesn't shed a tear of two could only be made of stone. Beautifully shot and directed and interlaced with some really nice music. Definitely one of the better movies of recent times and highly recommended.

In spite of my regard for her however, I was a little reluctant to see this movie, due to its association as a religious movie. In the end my regard for Britt won over and I took the plunge. I need not have been concerned as the religious content was very subtle and was perfectly within the context of the story. This is easily Britt Robertson's best performance to date and the way she interacted with K.J.Apa was remarkable. You could really feel the bond between them which by all accounts was genuine and it showed in the excellent performances from both of them. This is a very moving film and anyone who doesn't shed a tear of two could only be made of stone. Beautifully shot and directed and interlaced with some really nice music. Definitely one of the better movies of recent times and highly recommended. My seven star rating might seem a little low in view of my approval but I am a harsh judge and my rating is very much in line with IMdB's.

That said I just saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and thought it was a very interesting and very brave film. Well worth seeing if you can like strong, unusual films. Probably close to 30% of the audience walked out, but I was encouraged by the 70+% that remained, especially since most of the audience were 60+ Americans. The 20-somethings I talked to on the way out were very enthusiastic. The woman sitting next to me said "What did it mean? I don't understand" but to me there were enough deep meanings and points to ponder on a 30-minute drive home and I can't wait to tell friends about it. Everything from the dangers of creating a "perfect family" to "the mechanization of capitalism and upper middle class life" to metaphors for the dangers of repressive families and governments. At it's simplest, it proves that people, especially young ones, are in so many ways what their parents make them.

That said I just saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and thought it was a very interesting and very brave film. Well worth seeing if you can like strong, unusual films. Probably close to 30% of the audience walked out, but I was encouraged by the 70+% that remained, especially since most of the audience were 60+ Americans. The 20-somethings I talked to on the way out were very enthusiastic. The woman sitting next to me said "What did it mean? I don't understand" but to me there were enough deep meanings and points to ponder on a 30-minute drive home and I can't wait to tell friends about it. Everything from the dangers of creating a "perfect family" to "the mechanization of capitalism and upper middle class life" to metaphors for the dangers of repressive families and governments. At it's simplest, it proves that people, especially young ones, are in so many ways what their parents make them. This is not a film you will forget!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-11-11","keywords":"overprotective father,misuse of language,isolated house,child abuse,social isolation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Yorgos Lanthimos","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi998160921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE0ODVhZTQtZDJlYS00NmRjLWI2ZTItODE0YTgwODhlOTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE0ODVhZTQtZDJlYS00NmRjLWI2ZTItODE0YTgwODhlOTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"Awkward adults, dark humor, and absurd circumstances: Welcome to the films of Yorgos Lanthimos.

But it's a movie that I can't muster more than passable (but occasionally fairly ecstatic) enthusiasm for.  It's a very good action movie, and I can certainly see how it's attained a reputation as one of the best adrenaline-pumping rides of the 90's, but it's not great.\n\nWhat True Lies has is one of the more ingenious action movie premises I've seen.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is Harry Tasker, a husband (to Jamie Lee Curtis) and father (to Eliza Dushku) by day, and world-saving CIA agent by night (or day, it depeneds).  His latest assignment puts him on the case of a mad Islamic terrorist called Aziz, who's retrieved several nuclear warheads and plans to set them off on U.S. soil if his group's demands are not met.  Complicating matters for Harry is the inclusion of his wife, Helen, whom he believes is having an affair with a used car salesman (Bill Paxton, in what's got to be his funniest performance).\n\nIn terms of pure escapist enjoyment, this is actually James Cameron's most successful film.  True Lies is probably the only Cameron film that never suffers from the slightest hiccup in pacing (yes, Aliens had a slow beginning and viewing The Abyss was like watching molasses sliding down a brick wall).  From beginning to end, there's not a single slow spot, as you can expect either a sharply staged action sequence or comical setpiece around every corner.  To keep such momentum up for 141 minutes is pretty damn amazing, and Cameron must be given credit for making such a long movie almost so effortlessly enjoyable.\n\nBut for all that is so enjoyable about it, True Lies lacks a strong plot (in terms of action, as the romantic subplot is actually quite excellent).  The villains are stereotypical terrorists, pure cartoons who don't even make an impression as cool villains.  In his heyday, Arnold has battled tons of memorable villains (T-1000 and the Predator stand out), the terrorists here are clearly among the weakest of Arnold's foes to date.\n\nThe action is suitably over-the-top, especially the harrier jet climax, which makes almost all the action that came before it believable in comparison.  But the action is mostly excellent, the shootouts and fistfights are exciting, there's plenty of cliffhanger thrills, and the chase/catfight set on the lengthy bridge is classic.  \n\nThe movie has to keep a balance between strong violence and screwball humor, which it pulls off very well.  The half-hour segment devoted entirely to Harry's marital problems is hilarious, its only flaw being the abrupt segue to "typical" Arnold action.  Even when Arnold's taking down massive armies of terrorists, Cameron still maintains the same light tone evident during the comical scenes, while still keeping the action thrilling.  That's quite an accomplishment.  \n\nThe cast is all excellent, given the material and intent.  Schwarzenegger is still the extremely likeable big lug.  These roles aren't a stretch for him, but he excels at such parts because he radiates charisma like no other actor (even if they may all be better than him when it comes to talent).  As the comic relief, Tom Arnold is surprisingly very funny (since then, it hasn't been so surprising as he's actually provided decent humor in those Andrzej Bartkowiak films, or however you spell the guy's name).  Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful, too, and I've never been a big fan of hers.  Without a doubt, this is easily her most winning performance.\n\nOne of the big box-office hits of 1994, I was surprised to see True Lies didn't inspire any genuine imitators.  Just as well, I suppose, there's only so much Bond "parody" you can see without the material getting tiresome (Austin Powers, anyone?).

But it's a movie that I can't muster more than passable (but occasionally fairly ecstatic) enthusiasm for.  It's a very good action movie, and I can certainly see how it's attained a reputation as one of the best adrenaline-pumping rides of the 90's, but it's not great.\n\nWhat True Lies has is one of the more ingenious action movie premises I've seen.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is Harry Tasker, a husband (to Jamie Lee Curtis) and father (to Eliza Dushku) by day, and world-saving CIA agent by night (or day, it depeneds).  His latest assignment puts him on the case of a mad Islamic terrorist called Aziz, who's retrieved several nuclear warheads and plans to set them off on U.S. soil if his group's demands are not met.  Complicating matters for Harry is the inclusion of his wife, Helen, whom he believes is having an affair with a used car salesman (Bill Paxton, in what's got to be his funniest performance).\n\nIn terms of pure escapist enjoyment, this is actually James Cameron's most successful film.  True Lies is probably the only Cameron film that never suffers from the slightest hiccup in pacing (yes, Aliens had a slow beginning and viewing The Abyss was like watching molasses sliding down a brick wall).  From beginning to end, there's not a single slow spot, as you can expect either a sharply staged action sequence or comical setpiece around every corner.  To keep such momentum up for 141 minutes is pretty damn amazing, and Cameron must be given credit for making such a long movie almost so effortlessly enjoyable.\n\nBut for all that is so enjoyable about it, True Lies lacks a strong plot (in terms of action, as the romantic subplot is actually quite excellent).  The villains are stereotypical terrorists, pure cartoons who don't even make an impression as cool villains.  In his heyday, Arnold has battled tons of memorable villains (T-1000 and the Predator stand out), the terrorists here are clearly among the weakest of Arnold's foes to date.\n\nThe action is suitably over-the-top, especially the harrier jet climax, which makes almost all the action that came before it believable in comparison.  But the action is mostly excellent, the shootouts and fistfights are exciting, there's plenty of cliffhanger thrills, and the chase/catfight set on the lengthy bridge is classic.  \n\nThe movie has to keep a balance between strong violence and screwball humor, which it pulls off very well.  The half-hour segment devoted entirely to Harry's marital problems is hilarious, its only flaw being the abrupt segue to "typical" Arnold action.  Even when Arnold's taking down massive armies of terrorists, Cameron still maintains the same light tone evident during the comical scenes, while still keeping the action thrilling.  That's quite an accomplishment.  \n\nThe cast is all excellent, given the material and intent.  Schwarzenegger is still the extremely likeable big lug.  These roles aren't a stretch for him, but he excels at such parts because he radiates charisma like no other actor (even if they may all be better than him when it comes to talent).  As the comic relief, Tom Arnold is surprisingly very funny (since then, it hasn't been so surprising as he's actually provided decent humor in those Andrzej Bartkowiak films, or however you spell the guy's name).  Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful, too, and I've never been a big fan of hers.  Without a doubt, this is easily her most winning performance.\n\nOne of the big box-office hits of 1994, I was surprised to see True Lies didn't inspire any genuine imitators.  Just as well, I suppose, there's only so much Bond "parody" you can see without the material getting tiresome (Austin Powers, anyone?).  But True Lies' charms lies in that it works as parody while still excelling as a straight action thriller.  When it comes to pure direction, that's proof James Cameron can be a genius.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247173,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"],"duration":"PT2H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nolan has outdone himself !!","reviewBody":"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n\nBut then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'\n\nThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. \n\nThere is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n\nLeonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nolan has outdone himself !!","reviewBody":"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n\nBut then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'\n\nThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. \n\nThere is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n\nLeonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story is too well- known for me to set out the plot at any length, but it revolves around the adventures of Bathsheba Everdene, a young female landowner in Victorian Dorset, and the three men who love her. These are Gabriel Oak, a humble shepherd, William Boldwood, a neighbouring farmer, and Frank Troy, a sergeant in a cavalry regiment. \n\nVinterberg has set himself a difficult task. Schlesinger's film was a landmark of British cinema, marking the beginning of what I have come to think of the "heritage cinema" style of film-making. In my eyes at least, and I suspect in the eyes of many others, it has become the definitive version; I cannot re-read the novel- it is a favourite of mine and I have read it several times- without picturing Bathsheba as Julie Christie, Gabriel as Alan Bates, Troy as Terence Stamp or Boldwood as Peter Finch.\n\nLike Schlesinger, Vinterberg sticks fairly closely to Hardy's story, although of necessity some minor episodes have had to be omitted. There were one or two touches I didn't really care for, such as the scene where Troy grabs Bathsheba by the crotch. In the novel Hardy describes Troy's seduction of the young woman with great delicacy. This is not just a question of Victorian prudery, but also of psychological realism. A girl as independent and determined as Bathsheba would have resented such a crude approach; had Troy attempted it he would doubtless have got his face slapped for his pains. I also felt that this version rather inflated the social status of both Bathsheba and Boldwood. In the novel both are prosperous farmers, but nothing more. Here they live in the sort of style which would suggest she is the Lady of the Manor and he a wealthy aristocrat.\n\nHardy's novel is, among other things, a celebration of the English countryside, and this aspect is brought out well here. Like Schlesinger's, the film is visually attractive with some striking photography of the rural landscapes, often seen bathed in a soft, golden glow. On the acting side I was most impressed by Matthias Schoenaerts as Gabriel. His interpretation is rather different from Bates's, making his character perhaps more genteel and less rough-hewn, but still a man of great sensitivity and integrity. The Belgian-born Schoenaerts speaks flawless English with no hint of a foreign inflection, although it is noticeable that, unlike Bates, he does not attempt a West Country accent. Possibly wisely- English regional accents can be notoriously difficult for foreign-born actors.\n\nOn the other hand, I was less impressed by Tom Sturridge who makes an unmemorable Troy, lacking the roguishness and devil-may-care charm which Stamp brought to the role. Michael Sheen is better as Boldwood, but never quite matches Finch's desperate, nervous intensity. The difference, perhaps, is that Sheen's Boldwood is obsessed by Bathsheba whereas Finch's is almost literally possessed by her. Carey Mulligan has plenty of experience in films of this type, having inherited the crown formerly worn by Helena Bonham-Carter and Keira Knightley, that of Reigning Queen of Period Drama. She has been praised for her performance here, but personally I preferred Christie's rather more imperious and headstrong interpretation. Vinterberg's film is a generally solid, well- made piece of period drama, but for me it will not replace Schlesinger's as the definitive version. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2015-05-01","keywords":"farm,sheep,three men in love with the same woman,based on novel,playing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2575019545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNTMzMjA4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMyNzE1NDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNTMzMjA4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMyNzE1NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Victorian England, the independent and headstrong Bathsheba Everdene attracts three very different suitors: Gabriel Oak, a sheep farmer; Frank Troy, a reckless Sergeant; and William Boldwood, a prosperous and mature bachelor.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774386/","name":"Matthias Schoenaerts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790688/","name":"Michael Sheen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899121/","name":"Thomas Vinterberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362762/","name":"Thomas Hardy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0390141/","name":"David Nicholls"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ben Stiller, who usually seems to have little clue how to use his specific talents, gives his best performance to date in front of and behind the camera. This is a film that may not resemble the source material verbatim, but the spirit is clearly alive, with a few touches to modernize the idea. As a whole, it's a sweet, confident, and poignant film that has a lot to say, but I think it speaks only to those willing to listen.\n\nWalter Mitty (Stiller) is a negative asset manager for Life magazine- basically, his is the department responsible for bringing in and processing the film from the field that will go into the magazine (and by his 'department', I mean Walter and his assistant (Martinez) ). In essence, in the time Walter has worked at the publication, the very soul of the magazine has been processed on his watch. It's prescient, that his seemingly simple position holds so much sway, but we'll return to that idea.\n\nHis problem, it seems, is that he daydreams. Mind you, this isn't the type of absent-mindedness that you or I take part in. Walter misses large chunks of actual time in his fantasy land, jolted back to reality by silence, love interests, or transition managers. In his escapes, Walter is well-traveled and mysterious, interesting and not invisible to others. He's confident and allowed to pursue that which he wants. In other words, he's the full version of himself. I like how this film pulls back the comedic reigns here- Stiller too often becomes, well, Stiller, and overdoses on the comedy. Here, the humor is subtle and fits the tone of the film. It also doesn't pander, or make us feel sorry for Walter. There's a very good reason his life is the way it is, and again, it's presented without pretense.\n\nI mentioned a transition manager, profiled in full douchebag by Adam Scott. Well, the print version of Life is going under in this film, and switching to an online format. Positions like Walter's are likely to be eliminated, as well as accounting spots like the one Cheryl (Wiig) holds down. However, before the end, they want to send up one last issue, and long-time contributor Sean O'Connell (Penn), who has sent a roll of film containing an image he specifically wants to become the last cover. The problem is that Walter has either misplaced it, or it was lost along the way. This causes him to seek it out, thus finally spurring him to make his fantasies become, well, realities.\n\nI think a good portion of society can identify with an individual that finally lets loose a bit, that allows himself, finally, the adventure he deserves. A lesser film would make these emotional breakthroughs farcical, ala "Last Holiday", but this is subtle and decent. That's why the big reveal of what that last cover image is a fantastic moment. I believed in this Walter Mitty as a hard- working guy who missed out on life thus far due to some bad luck. It was wonderfully refreshing to see a character, despite his quirks, find happiness in the midst of just being, well, a good guy.\n\nI caution those looking simply for a pandering, feel-good story around the holidays. That's not what this is. Instead, Stiller and crew have taken the spirit of the source material and adapted it to our world. Granted, there are a few goofs- for example, Walter seems keen on good rock music and skateboard culture, but he isn't aware of a popular David Bowie song? Also, how does one get a clementine cake, sweet as it may be, through customs? Those things don't doom the film, but I do feel it's another reason this will divide people- those that claim this has nothing to offer but cynical product placement messages, and those like myself that sense a broader theme of becoming who we want to be, and understanding where we lose our way. That's a powerful thought, and this quietly beautiful film has the sense to not beat us over the head with it. After all, the film does tell us that "beautiful things don't ask for attention". That's certainly a statement that a number of filmmakers could stand to hear more often.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":303113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-12-25","keywords":"life magazine,magazine,photographer,daydream,x rayed skeleton","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3628050457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NDMyNDUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg4MjY2MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NDMyNDUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg4MjY2MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A day-dreamer escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action.

Na temelju književnoga klasika Thomasa Hardyja, DALEKO OD BJESOMUČNE GOMILE priča je o Bathshebi Everdene (Carey Mulligan), vrlo neovisnoj i živahnoj mladoj ženi koja naslijedi farmu svoga strica. Financijski neovisna (što je rijetkost u viktorijansko doba), lijepa i tvrdoglava - ona privuče tri vrlo različita, ali odlučna prosca: Gabriela Oaka (Matthias Schoenaerts), pastira očaranog njezinom svojeglavosti; Franka Troya (Tom Sturridge), naočita i nepromišljena narednika te Williama Boldwooda (Michael Sheen), bogata i zrela neženju. Ova bezvremenska priča o Bathshebinim izborima i strastima dok pokušava zadržati svoju neovisnost, istražuje prirodu odnosa i ljubavi - kao i ljudsku sposobnost da prevlada teškoće zahvaljujući otpornosti i ustrajnosti.</desc>

Ben Stiller, who usually seems to have little clue how to use his specific talents, gives his best performance to date in front of and behind the camera. This is a film that may not resemble the source material verbatim, but the spirit is clearly alive, with a few touches to modernize the idea. As a whole, it's a sweet, confident, and poignant film that has a lot to say, but I think it speaks only to those willing to listen.\n\nWalter Mitty (Stiller) is a negative asset manager for Life magazine- basically, his is the department responsible for bringing in and processing the film from the field that will go into the magazine (and by his 'department', I mean Walter and his assistant (Martinez) ). In essence, in the time Walter has worked at the publication, the very soul of the magazine has been processed on his watch. It's prescient, that his seemingly simple position holds so much sway, but we'll return to that idea.\n\nHis problem, it seems, is that he daydreams. Mind you, this isn't the type of absent-mindedness that you or I take part in. Walter misses large chunks of actual time in his fantasy land, jolted back to reality by silence, love interests, or transition managers. In his escapes, Walter is well-traveled and mysterious, interesting and not invisible to others. He's confident and allowed to pursue that which he wants. In other words, he's the full version of himself. I like how this film pulls back the comedic reigns here- Stiller too often becomes, well, Stiller, and overdoses on the comedy. Here, the humor is subtle and fits the tone of the film. It also doesn't pander, or make us feel sorry for Walter. There's a very good reason his life is the way it is, and again, it's presented without pretense.\n\nI mentioned a transition manager, profiled in full douchebag by Adam Scott. Well, the print version of Life is going under in this film, and switching to an online format. Positions like Walter's are likely to be eliminated, as well as accounting spots like the one Cheryl (Wiig) holds down. However, before the end, they want to send up one last issue, and long-time contributor Sean O'Connell (Penn), who has sent a roll of film containing an image he specifically wants to become the last cover. The problem is that Walter has either misplaced it, or it was lost along the way. This causes him to seek it out, thus finally spurring him to make his fantasies become, well, realities.\n\nI think a good portion of society can identify with an individual that finally lets loose a bit, that allows himself, finally, the adventure he deserves. A lesser film would make these emotional breakthroughs farcical, ala "Last Holiday", but this is subtle and decent. That's why the big reveal of what that last cover image is a fantastic moment. I believed in this Walter Mitty as a hard- working guy who missed out on life thus far due to some bad luck. It was wonderfully refreshing to see a character, despite his quirks, find happiness in the midst of just being, well, a good guy.\n\nI caution those looking simply for a pandering, feel-good story around the holidays. That's not what this is. Instead, Stiller and crew have taken the spirit of the source material and adapted it to our world. Granted, there are a few goofs- for example, Walter seems keen on good rock music and skateboard culture, but he isn't aware of a popular David Bowie song? Also, how does one get a clementine cake, sweet as it may be, through customs? Those things don't doom the film, but I do feel it's another reason this will divide people- those that claim this has nothing to offer but cynical product placement messages, and those like myself that sense a broader theme of becoming who we want to be, and understanding where we lose our way. That's a powerful thought, and this quietly beautiful film has the sense to not beat us over the head with it. After all, the film does tell us that "beautiful things don't ask for attention". That's certainly a statement that a number of filmmakers could stand to hear more often.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":303113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-12-25","keywords":"life magazine,magazine,photographer,daydream,x rayed skeleton","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3628050457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NDMyNDUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg4MjY2MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NDMyNDUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg4MjY2MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A day-dreamer escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action.

It started out strong concentrating on the Frank Winter character and a few others, J.B Hickey and Olivia Williams are terrific actors and draw the viewer into their story. The Charlie Isaacs character appears to be based on Richard Feynman, who related a number of Los Alamos incidents in his book"Surely You're Joking..." each of which would have made great episodes. Instead there has been little description of the very real drama that occurred there, and i agree with previous reviewers that this show has been a disappointment. I did very much like the episode about the trip to Oak Ridge, but it could have been so much better if they had stuck to the Feynman story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8099,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,headstrong woman,detective,surname in series title,equality for women","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They are two extraordinary detective shows, which I strongly recommend.\n\nSo I gave Endeavour a try, both with curiosity and with fear that the experience would ruin my memories of the two shows I liked so much.\n\nAlso, Shaun Evans is physically very different from John Thaw, so this made me cringe even before the start.\n\nHaving said this, I fell for it from the very first episode.\n\nI was surprised to find out that Shaun Evans is a terrific actor, who plays an entirely credible Morse, if not physically, in a seamless psychological continuity which makes you feel the smooth way in which this young Morse would become the older Morse 20 years later, the incipient causticity, the noticeable anger, the budding low-key self-confidence--- This is very skillfully done in the prequel.\n\nBoth Thaw and Evans play the magic of giving a sexy twist to an unsexy character, without flashing the sexy card or even circumventing all attempts to look hot.\n\nAllum plays a marvelous D.C. Thursday and the interaction between them, mentor-pupil, is instrumental to explain how this young Morse ends up being that later Morse.\n\nThe 60's atmosphere is a plus in the show, very well portrayed and recreated. I'd say that the linking common trait between Morse, Endeavour and Lewis is, yes, their tremendous atmospheric virtue which sets you right on «in that particular place in that particular time».\n\nIf you like detective stories, you will not be disappointed at all, and even if you are not a Morse or Lewis fan, you will find this show entertaining, alluring and deeply satisfactory by its own right.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Tommaso Buscetta, a made man, flees to hide out in Brazil. Back home, scores are being settled and Buscetta watches from afar as his sons and brother are killed in Palermo, knowing he may be next. Arrested and extradited to Italy by the Brazilian police, Buscetta makes a decision that will change everything for the Mafia: he decides to meet with Judge Giovanni Falcone and betray the eternal vow he made to the Casa Nostra.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269419/","name":"Pierfrancesco Favino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194655/","name":"Maria Fernanda Cândido","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273827/","name":"Fabrizio Ferracane"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069166/","name":"Marco Bellocchio"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0324308/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293017/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066197/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069166/","name":"Marco Bellocchio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0763460/","name":"Valia Santella","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2002638/","name":"Ludovica Rampoldi"],"duration":"PT2H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's like the writer just force that to happen.\n\nThere are many ridiculous moments, and forced story. That biological dad got the wrong baby, it is just like really weird. It's like it's in the story just to prolong the duration.\n\nThe lead character is bad. She is that mom in Boyhood. She was OK in there, but she is really bad in this series. The other character is typical stereotype with the "cyber" theme, Geek, Hacker, and Gamer.\n\nIt's not original it's just rehash of detective TV show with forced Cyber theme.

It's like the writer just force that to happen.\n\nThere are many ridiculous moments, and forced story. That biological dad got the wrong baby, it is just like really weird. It's like it's in the story just to prolong the duration.\n\nThe lead character is bad. She is that mom in Boyhood. She was OK in there, but she is really bad in this series. The other character is typical stereotype with the "cyber" theme, Geek, Hacker, and Gamer.\n\nIt's not original it's just rehash of detective TV show with forced Cyber theme.

The answer soon comes when said genius criminal Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) offers to help the FBI agent who originally caught him solve a case that's been frustrating him for years. Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) while wary, realizes this "may"...repeat "may" be a way to finally catch the bad guy.. White Collar is another USA "Characters welcome" offering, and it's a great one.\n\nTim DeKay is pitch perfect as the agent who lives his job. He has a kind of "Tom Hanks meets young Jack Lemmon" quality that is spot on for the tone of the show. He's written as real guy in a tough spot. He truly loves his wife, but tireless dedication to "the job" causes him to forget anniversaries, and regularly arrive home after his wife is long 'a bed. His wife Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen) often eats dinners alone... well, sort of.\n\nMatt Bomer, soon to be a household name, vaults from his supporting role of Bryce on "Chuck" straight into a major lead role that fits him like a glove... like he was born to do this. Along with class A hunky good looks, Bomer also has a vulnerable quality that is quite touching. Ladies, he's Oooo so cute, slick, smart and gosh darn lovable, that your significant other may actually allow you to gaze... This show has something for everyone. The story line is not at all predictable. You want to watch how this might end.\n\nTiffani Thiessen is actually a lovely surprise, having matured nicely as an actress from her 90210 days. Amazing for a pilot, there is sweet gentle chemistry with her FBI hubby. \n\nThis FBI version of the "truly odd couple" takes straight off on a smart, well written, snappy crime-solving adventure. The dialog is zippy, and once the obligatory plot setup is laid down, the laughs come early and often. This too makes White Collar good family entertainment. \n\nIf the series follows the pilot's lead, there will be ZERO gratuitous violence, another reason to appreciate the show. Caffrey charms and disarms all creatures great and small, while using his near savant abilities to see what the FBI cannot. The lead characters are perfectly complementary. The casting is sublime. Even the score is hip, something that USA recently seems to have cornered the market on.\n\nPersonally I can't wait for the next installment of what promises to be a seriously entertaining and original show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-10-23","keywords":"thief,white collar crime,brilliant mind,name calling,nickname","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093589/","name":"Matt Bomer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215229/","name":"Tim DeKay"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0288470/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094955/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247609/","name":"Jeff Eastin"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"White Collar: Season Six","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433724697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for White Collar The Complete Sixth Season"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even the score is hip, something that USA recently seems to have cornered the market on.\n\nPersonally I can't wait for the next installment of what promises to be a seriously entertaining and original show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-10-23","keywords":"thief,white collar crime,brilliant mind,name calling,nickname","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093589/","name":"Matt Bomer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215229/","name":"Tim DeKay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0288470/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094955/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247609/","name":"Jeff Eastin"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"White Collar: Season Six","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433724697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNWVhOTgtYTA1Ni00ZThkLTg3NTQtMWRkZDRiNTYxNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for White Collar The Complete Sixth Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Are they serious that they were going to make a show about a bunch of shallow people living on a street having sex and complaining about not having enough sex? But at the end, I was wrong.\n\nThis is a show about misunderstood and troubled people who really cares about each other and shows it. They are human and they hurt people like everyday-people do. I love this show and it is so humane and the characters are so likable in every single way.\n\nThe desperate housewives are portrayed by Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, and Eva Longoria. As much I hate the character Gabrielle, I have to say, I have to love Eva Logoria's charm because she is delightful to watch as a person in interviews. I love the character Bree. She is so stunning to watch as this perfectionist with a family that is nothing but 'perfect.' Felicity Huffman plays the real everyday-mom who's stressed - Lynette, who's also an great character. There's Teri Hatcher's character, Susan, which I liked at first but she gets boring but she does have a great cheerleader, her daughter Julie, who is probably much more likable than her.\n\nAnd there's Edie Britt ... the 'slut' of the neighborhood. I hated her at first, but then, slowly, loved her.\n\nWhat makes this show so creative is that it is narrated by a housewife that committed suicide on episode one. It is an extremely nice turn in television.\n\nThis is my favorite show ... next to Lost. ABC is doing very well this season.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-10-03","keywords":"voice over narration,undercover,husband wife relationship,conflict of interest,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000159/","name":"Teri Hatcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005031/","name":"Felicity Huffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189220/","name":"Marcia Cross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028589/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156100/","name":"Marc Cherry"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1644955417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"TT #1"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think they even came at the same time in the theaters in my country. One was AntZ, the other was A Bug's Life. The first one was rumoured to be more suited to adults, the other a kiddie movie. While that statement had some merit, at the end it turned out that A Bug's Life was a far better movie entertainment-wise, despite cuter characters and simpler story and all that kiddie-like appearance. AntZ were just plain dull.\n\nPixar seems to like choosing a simple story, one that a kid can understand, and than building upon it creating a wonderful movie for all ages. Dreamworks builds his scripts on pop-culture references and more adult themes, and while it works sometimes (Shrek was fantastic), at other times it just falls flat.\n\nSome say it's unfair to compare Finding Nemo and Shark Tale, them being totally different movies with the only matching characteristic being antropomorphic fish, but it seems that the comparison is inevitable. It's the ants thing all over again. Finding Nemo was simply wonderful, great movie with a perfect sense of humour and memorable characters. Sure, they were cute and cuddly, but they had a soul.\n\nShark Tale, again, tries to appeal to the adults, but this time the results are even worse. The characters are not so important as the cast is, even so much that we are being sledgehammered on the head in who's playing who. A word to the wise - I don't care how big the names doing the voicework are, I want to immerse in the movie's story. When I saw Shrek, I didn't see Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy there, I saw Shrek and Donkey. Here I see De Niro, Smith, Scorsese and so on. At one point I even caught myself wondering why the other fish keep calling Will Smith "Oscar".\n\nAs for the story, it kind of drags along. I couldn't really sympathize with the lead character - he is at the same time stupid and so full of himself that I didn't care about his motivations or the messes he got himself into. Also, somehow the story didn't map so well in the underwater world. What is the Shark mafia exactly ? Are they supposed to be predators or criminals? Basically the mafia thing is here only to serve as a playground for mob-movie references, but it serves no purpose story-wise. Also, the entire world seems very unbelievable. Flahing electrical neon signs? Fire hydrants? It actually backfires, since instead of getting a kick out of fishes living like humans, mostly you feel like you're watching an alien movie, with the aliens resembling our world's fishes in some ways.\n\nAll in all, I did enjoy the movie, but only in the sense that I didn't feel cheated out of my money. A couple of the jokes worked, some pop-culture references were funny, the movie was not too boring. But when I remember that after Nemo or Incredibles I was smiling even a few hours after the movie, then I see that Shark Tale ain't what it possibly could be.

I think they even came at the same time in the theaters in my country. One was AntZ, the other was A Bug's Life. The first one was rumoured to be more suited to adults, the other a kiddie movie. While that statement had some merit, at the end it turned out that A Bug's Life was a far better movie entertainment-wise, despite cuter characters and simpler story and all that kiddie-like appearance. AntZ were just plain dull.\n\nPixar seems to like choosing a simple story, one that a kid can understand, and than building upon it creating a wonderful movie for all ages. Dreamworks builds his scripts on pop-culture references and more adult themes, and while it works sometimes (Shrek was fantastic), at other times it just falls flat.\n\nSome say it's unfair to compare Finding Nemo and Shark Tale, them being totally different movies with the only matching characteristic being antropomorphic fish, but it seems that the comparison is inevitable. It's the ants thing all over again. Finding Nemo was simply wonderful, great movie with a perfect sense of humour and memorable characters. Sure, they were cute and cuddly, but they had a soul.\n\nShark Tale, again, tries to appeal to the adults, but this time the results are even worse. The characters are not so important as the cast is, even so much that we are being sledgehammered on the head in who's playing who. A word to the wise - I don't care how big the names doing the voicework are, I want to immerse in the movie's story. When I saw Shrek, I didn't see Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy there, I saw Shrek and Donkey. Here I see De Niro, Smith, Scorsese and so on. At one point I even caught myself wondering why the other fish keep calling Will Smith "Oscar".\n\nAs for the story, it kind of drags along. I couldn't really sympathize with the lead character - he is at the same time stupid and so full of himself that I didn't care about his motivations or the messes he got himself into. Also, somehow the story didn't map so well in the underwater world. What is the Shark mafia exactly ? Are they supposed to be predators or criminals? Basically the mafia thing is here only to serve as a playground for mob-movie references, but it serves no purpose story-wise. Also, the entire world seems very unbelievable. Flahing electrical neon signs? Fire hydrants? It actually backfires, since instead of getting a kick out of fishes living like humans, mostly you feel like you're watching an alien movie, with the aliens resembling our world's fishes in some ways.\n\nAll in all, I did enjoy the movie, but only in the sense that I didn't feel cheated out of my money. A couple of the jokes worked, some pop-culture references were funny, the movie was not too boring. But when I remember that after Nemo or Incredibles I was smiling even a few hours after the movie, then I see that Shark Tale ain't what it possibly could be. It's just a popcorn movie, easily forgettable. And rightfully so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173685,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"fish,shark,pufferfish,sea turtle,anthropomorphic animal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shark Tale","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2072445209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGFhODYwZjMtMzkwOS00MmMyLTg0MzQtMGZjN2Y1OGU4ODlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGFhODYwZjMtMzkwOS00MmMyLTg0MzQtMGZjN2Y1OGU4ODlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "October 1st"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074426/","name":"Bibo Bergeron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421776/","name":"Vicky Jenson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1224299/","name":"Rob Letterman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5022110/","name":"Michael J.

I think they even came at the same time in the theaters in my country. One was AntZ, the other was A Bug's Life. The first one was rumoured to be more suited to adults, the other a kiddie movie. While that statement had some merit, at the end it turned out that A Bug's Life was a far better movie entertainment-wise, despite cuter characters and simpler story and all that kiddie-like appearance. AntZ were just plain dull.\n\nPixar seems to like choosing a simple story, one that a kid can understand, and than building upon it creating a wonderful movie for all ages. Dreamworks builds his scripts on pop-culture references and more adult themes, and while it works sometimes (Shrek was fantastic), at other times it just falls flat.\n\nSome say it's unfair to compare Finding Nemo and Shark Tale, them being totally different movies with the only matching characteristic being antropomorphic fish, but it seems that the comparison is inevitable. It's the ants thing all over again. Finding Nemo was simply wonderful, great movie with a perfect sense of humour and memorable characters. Sure, they were cute and cuddly, but they had a soul.\n\nShark Tale, again, tries to appeal to the adults, but this time the results are even worse. The characters are not so important as the cast is, even so much that we are being sledgehammered on the head in who's playing who. A word to the wise - I don't care how big the names doing the voicework are, I want to immerse in the movie's story. When I saw Shrek, I didn't see Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy there, I saw Shrek and Donkey. Here I see De Niro, Smith, Scorsese and so on. At one point I even caught myself wondering why the other fish keep calling Will Smith "Oscar".\n\nAs for the story, it kind of drags along. I couldn't really sympathize with the lead character - he is at the same time stupid and so full of himself that I didn't care about his motivations or the messes he got himself into. Also, somehow the story didn't map so well in the underwater world. What is the Shark mafia exactly ? Are they supposed to be predators or criminals? Basically the mafia thing is here only to serve as a playground for mob-movie references, but it serves no purpose story-wise. Also, the entire world seems very unbelievable. Flahing electrical neon signs? Fire hydrants? It actually backfires, since instead of getting a kick out of fishes living like humans, mostly you feel like you're watching an alien movie, with the aliens resembling our world's fishes in some ways.\n\nAll in all, I did enjoy the movie, but only in the sense that I didn't feel cheated out of my money. A couple of the jokes worked, some pop-culture references were funny, the movie was not too boring. But when I remember that after Nemo or Incredibles I was smiling even a few hours after the movie, then I see that Shark Tale ain't what it possibly could be.

They give the air of using the screenplay as the easiest of diving boards into just shooting-the-hell-of-it with one another as two friends. Rudd plays a guy about to get married and is embarrassed to find out, from all those around him more than anything, that he doesn't have many, or really any, true friends.

They give the air of using the screenplay as the easiest of diving boards into just shooting-the-hell-of-it with one another as two friends. Rudd plays a guy about to get married and is embarrassed to find out, from all those around him more than anything, that he doesn't have many, or really any, true friends. He meets Siegel at an open house for Lou Ferrigno (he's a real estate agent and Ferrigno fills the oddball cameo choice, it's a great choice though), and the two hit it off as a "bromance" develops.\n\nIt's this "bromance" that makes I Love You, Man a little interesting as a double-edged romantic comedy.

I really enjoyed the first, and while watchable the second was a disappointment. Look Who's Talking Now has its good points, such as the soundtrack and the two dogs voiced wonderfully by Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton.

My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E.

Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind.

You'll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining 90 minutes.\n\n8* STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1041476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"robot,obesity,recycling robot,adrift in space,cgi animation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wall E","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192703769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Wall E - Trailer #3","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123785/","name":"Ben Burtt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2264184/","name":"Elissa Knight","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307531/","name":"Jeff Garlin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0622634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714114/","name":"Jim Reardon"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I've loved most of his movies, including the two previous movies he's directed, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. I've seen each many times, and they are two of my favorite comedies. \n\nThis, however, didn't prepare me for his newest, Funny People. Apatow has become well known for his sweet, adult comedies, but this movie is very different from his others. I would almost call it a "funny drama." This has it's pros and cons. I don't think I laughed out loud as much as in either of the other two films, but what I got in return, is an actual good movie, that's actually ABOUT something.\n\nI liked Adam Sandler before I knew what a good movie was, as I grew up watching his lighter movies, like Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, etc. I've seen him so much that he ceased becoming an actor to me and actually reached a point of self-parody. His role as comedian George Simmons is perfect for him, because he's basically playing himself, to a point. He gives the performance of his life, even better than Punch-Drunk- Love. His portrayal is cold and confused, angry and hurt. It's what a comedian might truly be like when he's not on stage. He plays it perfectly, providing a likable character while at the same time showing us there might not be so much to like. He's the best part of this movie, and that's saying something\n\nThe supporting cast is great, as usual. Seth Rogan actually plays a different character than his other movies as Ira, who acts as a great foil to George Simmons. Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill provide some great comedic backup, including their hilarious fictional sitcom "Yo, Teach". In fact, a lot of the laugh out loud comedy from the film stems from the many supporting performances and cameos (My favorites being Marshall Mathers and James Taylor). Eric Bana is very funny, and Leslie Mann gives an impressive performance as well.\n\nFunny People's only real problem is it's ambition, and that's definitely the best problem to have. It's nearly two and a half hours, and while I didn't have a problem with the length, it obviously had to end when it did, as there aren't many people who would want to sit through a three hour comedy. I wish it could have ran even longer, as some subplots weren't fleshed out nearly enough. I really liked the romance between Ira and Daisy (Played by Aubrey Plaza, who is sweet and funny in every scene she's in), but it was rushed, and in the end cut short, which is a shame, because it's one of the best parts of the movie.\n\nAbove all, this is a real movie. It's success doesn't just depend on the amount of laughs it receives. Thanks to Sandler and a thought provoking story, this is more than just another raunchy-sweet comedy. The movie will definitely divide people more than the others, and I'm not sure it will find as big of an audience. Judd Apatow has improved tremendously with each movie he's directed, and, despite his detractors, he's going to be the king of the comedy movie for a long, long time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-10-21","keywords":"columbia tristar,movie flop,comedian,stand up comedian,breasts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Funny People -- International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4124967449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0ODY2Nzk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0ODE3Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0ODY2Nzk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0ODE3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When seasoned comedian George Simmons learns of his terminal, inoperable health condition, his desire to form a genuine friendship cause him to take a relatively green performer under his wing as his opening act."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005182/","name":"Leslie Mann"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT2H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've loved most of his movies, including the two previous movies he's directed, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. I've seen each many times, and they are two of my favorite comedies. \n\nThis, however, didn't prepare me for his newest, Funny People. Apatow has become well known for his sweet, adult comedies, but this movie is very different from his others. I would almost call it a "funny drama." This has it's pros and cons. I don't think I laughed out loud as much as in either of the other two films, but what I got in return, is an actual good movie, that's actually ABOUT something.\n\nI liked Adam Sandler before I knew what a good movie was, as I grew up watching his lighter movies, like Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, etc. I've seen him so much that he ceased becoming an actor to me and actually reached a point of self-parody. His role as comedian George Simmons is perfect for him, because he's basically playing himself, to a point. He gives the performance of his life, even better than Punch-Drunk- Love. His portrayal is cold and confused, angry and hurt. It's what a comedian might truly be like when he's not on stage. He plays it perfectly, providing a likable character while at the same time showing us there might not be so much to like. He's the best part of this movie, and that's saying something\n\nThe supporting cast is great, as usual. Seth Rogan actually plays a different character than his other movies as Ira, who acts as a great foil to George Simmons. Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill provide some great comedic backup, including their hilarious fictional sitcom "Yo, Teach". In fact, a lot of the laugh out loud comedy from the film stems from the many supporting performances and cameos (My favorites being Marshall Mathers and James Taylor). Eric Bana is very funny, and Leslie Mann gives an impressive performance as well.\n\nFunny People's only real problem is it's ambition, and that's definitely the best problem to have. It's nearly two and a half hours, and while I didn't have a problem with the length, it obviously had to end when it did, as there aren't many people who would want to sit through a three hour comedy. I wish it could have ran even longer, as some subplots weren't fleshed out nearly enough. I really liked the romance between Ira and Daisy (Played by Aubrey Plaza, who is sweet and funny in every scene she's in), but it was rushed, and in the end cut short, which is a shame, because it's one of the best parts of the movie.\n\nAbove all, this is a real movie. It's success doesn't just depend on the amount of laughs it receives. Thanks to Sandler and a thought provoking story, this is more than just another raunchy-sweet comedy. The movie will definitely divide people more than the others, and I'm not sure it will find as big of an audience. Judd Apatow has improved tremendously with each movie he's directed, and, despite his detractors, he's going to be the king of the comedy movie for a long, long time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-10-21","keywords":"columbia tristar,movie flop,comedian,stand up comedian,breasts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Funny People -- International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4124967449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0ODY2Nzk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0ODE3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0ODY2Nzk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0ODE3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When seasoned comedian George Simmons learns of his terminal, inoperable health condition, his desire to form a genuine friendship cause him to take a relatively green performer under his wing as his opening act.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005182/","name":"Leslie Mann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"duration":"PT2H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They give the air of using the screenplay as the easiest of diving boards into just shooting-the-hell-of-it with one another as two friends. Rudd plays a guy about to get married and is embarrassed to find out, from all those around him more than anything, that he doesn't have many, or really any, true friends. He meets Siegel at an open house for Lou Ferrigno (he's a real estate agent and Ferrigno fills the oddball cameo choice, it's a great choice though), and the two hit it off as a "bromance" develops.\n\nIt's this "bromance" that makes I Love You, Man a little interesting as a double-edged romantic comedy. It's already about Rudd and his to-be played by Rashida Jones, their little moments of fun and their arguments too (there's a cute running gag involving Rudd's imitations of the band Rush sounding like an Irishman), but then it's also got plenty of innuendo to this being really about the guys, how Siegel gets attached to Rudd in that way that surely isn't gay but is more than just casual acquaintance stuff (see his "investment" plan unfold). But truth be told it's not even this that makes I Love You, Man so funny.\n\nRudd and Siegel are simply funny guys, but naturally so; there's a new trend to put a somewhat straight face on gross out gags in these movies, Apatow or its spin-off groups (one can equate it to the good rip-offs of Tarantino in the 90s to a certain extent), and it works very well here. It's like a sweet blending of Curb Your Enthusiasm awkwardness (if, of course, nowhere near the genius of that, especially with story) and some of the low-brow Adam Sandler stuff and joyfully useless banter and non-jock male bonding. It's not any better or lessor than recent stuff from Siegel and Rudd; you could watch this with either Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Role Models and be satisfied about the same. Again, plot is not at all the strong suit, but if you just want some cleverly obvious comedy dialog it's a good detour.\n\nAt the least, we get one of the funniest lines of the year, or just in years, near the very end: "I love you...

Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the "zaftig" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.\n\nGreg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.\n\nSo, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see "Meet the Fockers". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long.

Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the "zaftig" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.\n\nGreg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.\n\nSo, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see "Meet the Fockers". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long. Rated a B+.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261092,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-02-09","keywords":"neo screwball comedy,dysfunctional family,farce,family character name in title,male nurse","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Meet the Fockers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi261488921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5YWUyNTQtZTFkZC00NTBkLWI5ODQtNjIyZmM5NjQ0N2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5YWUyNTQtZTFkZC00NTBkLWI5ODQtNjIyZmM5NjQ0N2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001100/","name":"Blythe Danner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322839/","name":"Greg Glienna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0164898/","name":"Mary Ruth Clarke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381272/","name":"Jim Herzfeld"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.\n\nLiam Neeson, as usual, is just SO GOOD, you wish he had more screen time.\n\n\n* Orlando Bloom, actually surprisingly, was able to carry the movie as a lead. I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.\n\n\n\n* Battle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we've been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.\n\n\n\n* Portrayal of the Muslims. EXTREMELY fair. In being "even-handed" to Christians and Muslims there, if anything, they emphasized the Christian fanatics (in the form of the Templars in particular, to simplify things) as being the "badguys" more than anyone else... (which is historically accurate to some degree, in my understanding). I was surprised and pleased that they tried to be accurate, and didn't try to emphasize some "BAD MUSLIMS" to make it "even".\n\n\n\n* Movie is very secular in it's moralizing.\n\n\nAnd it portrays Christianity particularly religious men, VERY badly (the Priest who steals the cross from Bloom's wife's corpse... the Bishop in Jerusalem who's ready to convert to Islam at the first sign of defeat... and who also wants to abandon the civilians... the knights templar...) I thought this got a tad gratuitous. There were really NO GOOD Christian FIGURES IN THE MOVIE. The only good purported Christians were basically acting Agnostic (Bloom, Neeson, etc.) The actual religious Christians were made out to be hypocrites.\n\nMeanwhile Saladhudin was a man of honor.. but also somewhat moderate.\n\n\n* Movie could definitely have a little more narrative focus and maybe have a little more of an emotional circle for Orlando Bloom character. The emotional arc is ALREADY complete fairly early in the movie (Bloom becomes a man of conscience)... and it's kind of boring since the character doesn't really move after that.\n\n\nBut the movie tackled a HUGE topic and tackled it fairly well. I just wish there was a better script to handle the compelling personal journey for Orlando Bloom (from widower, murderer seeking redemption, lost bastard son) that was PROMISED at the beginning.\n\nIt seems that as soon as he brings water to his father's old land, he's just about done his journey, and it turns into a simple historical battle movie. (but a darn good one)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":274954,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-05-04","keywords":"crusader,12th century,jerusalem,templar,knights templar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kingdom of Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2492727577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323361/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184258/","name":"William Monahan"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.\n\nLiam Neeson, as usual, is just SO GOOD, you wish he had more screen time.\n\n\n* Orlando Bloom, actually surprisingly, was able to carry the movie as a lead. I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.\n\n\n\n* Battle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we've been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.\n\n\n\n* Portrayal of the Muslims. EXTREMELY fair. In being "even-handed" to Christians and Muslims there, if anything, they emphasized the Christian fanatics (in the form of the Templars in particular, to simplify things) as being the "badguys" more than anyone else... (which is historically accurate to some degree, in my understanding). I was surprised and pleased that they tried to be accurate, and didn't try to emphasize some "BAD MUSLIMS" to make it "even".\n\n\n\n* Movie is very secular in it's moralizing.\n\n\nAnd it portrays Christianity particularly religious men, VERY badly (the Priest who steals the cross from Bloom's wife's corpse... the Bishop in Jerusalem who's ready to convert to Islam at the first sign of defeat... and who also wants to abandon the civilians... the knights templar...) I thought this got a tad gratuitous. There were really NO GOOD Christian FIGURES IN THE MOVIE. The only good purported Christians were basically acting Agnostic (Bloom, Neeson, etc.) The actual religious Christians were made out to be hypocrites.\n\nMeanwhile Saladhudin was a man of honor.. but also somewhat moderate.\n\n\n* Movie could definitely have a little more narrative focus and maybe have a little more of an emotional circle for Orlando Bloom character. The emotional arc is ALREADY complete fairly early in the movie (Bloom becomes a man of conscience)... and it's kind of boring since the character doesn't really move after that.\n\n\nBut the movie tackled a HUGE topic and tackled it fairly well. I just wish there was a better script to handle the compelling personal journey for Orlando Bloom (from widower, murderer seeking redemption, lost bastard son) that was PROMISED at the beginning.\n\nIt seems that as soon as he brings water to his father's old land, he's just about done his journey, and it turns into a simple historical battle movie. (but a darn good one)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":274954,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-05-04","keywords":"crusader,12th century,jerusalem,templar,knights templar","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kingdom of Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2492727577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323361/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184258/","name":"William Monahan"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That being said however I was very excited to return to Middle Earth for a new story..and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.\n\nThis is the Prequel story to LOTR following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Frodo's Uncle played by Ian Holm previously) and how he came to be in possession on the ring. \n\nPeter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. .is quite simply a BEAUTIFUL film! I saw the movie in 3D and at the 48fps that Jackson intended and I was blown away by how it looked. It's a stunning film that left me with the same 'WOW' factor that the original trilogy did a decade ago. Set 60 years earlier than Lord of The Rings, We are introduced to a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). He is a content Hobbit, not concerned with adventure of any sort. Until Gandalf (Ian McKellan) suddenly appears, along with a group of unruly Dwarfs and offers Bilbo the chance to be part of a great adventure. The dwarfs wish to reclaim their homeland, which has been taken over by a huge dragon named Smaug, It's a simple concept and one that probably shouldn't be stretched over 3 movies but as with any 'first in a trilogy' film, it sets the stage perfectly. The movie has some great scenes.. meeting the Dwarfs in Bilbo's house, the run in with fighting stone giants and the escape from deep within the goblins' mountain are particular highlights. I loved the scene in which Bilbo runs into a familiar face (for LOTR fans) in the caves: Gollum (who looks amazing with todays MOCAP technology). Much of the movie, is the journey of the troupe back to the mountain, but also the journey of Bilbo himself.. mild and timid at the start of the film, our hero finds his courage, several times over, through the course of this film. \n\nOverall I loved this film, I thought it looked fantastic and the care of attention not just aesthetically but also in terms of continuity were obvious. These are Peter Jacksons films, no doubt. Much like he did with the previous trilogy, bringing us into a world full of heroes and villains, orcs and wizards this film literally (thanks to the 3D and FPS rate) literally transports you into Middle Earth.\n\nI am already excited to see the next instalment but to keep me satisfied until then..i may go and watch my LOTR boxset again .

Like lions. One day dad brings home this tiny, cute white lion cub, and they call him Charlie. At first Mia is annoyed with the cub, wants him to leave her alone, but they eventually bond.\n\nWhen Charlie is about to be sold Mia finds out the actual fate of most of the "trophy" animals, they are sold to become targets of big game hunters in a captive environment, still a legal activity in South Africa. Mia decides to take drastic action to try and save Charlie from that fate.\n\nThere is a good "extra" on the disc telling about the process and what had to be done to train the lion to become the young actress' friend and not eat her.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2018-12-24","keywords":"singing in a car,girl lion relationship,animal in title,pet lion,white lion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3207183129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444538/","name":"Daniah De Villiers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491259/","name":"Mélanie Laurent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456810/","name":"Langley Kirkwood"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058643/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0461578/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049118/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444537/","name":"Prune de Maistre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp "farting," that amuses children.

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion.

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something.

It helped draw you into the movie and make you feel like you were in it, and it made the CGI more convincing.\n\nVery intense film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":382657,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-03-05","keywords":"found footage,night vision,gigantic monster,alien,party","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cloverfield","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi78774553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlmYWM0NGMtMDE2OS00YjUxLTkzNGQtZTIyZTM3MmIxMGIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdvb3N0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlmYWM0NGMtMDE2OS00YjUxLTkzNGQtZTIyZTM3MmIxMGIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdvb3N0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Cloverfield Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1036181/","name":"Mike Vogel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140300/","name":"Jessica Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135221/","name":"Lizzy Caplan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0716257/","name":"Matt Reeves"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021593/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0657425/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1206844/","name":"Drew Goddard"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Wallace i njegov pas Gromit započeli su potpuno novi posao - pekarnicu "Top Bun". No postoji jedan problem - ostali lokalni pekari u gradu nestaju jedan po jedan... Je li Wallace sljedeći na redu? Wallace i Gromit započeli su novi posao pečenja kruha, "Top Bun", i pretvorili svoju kuću u Ulici West Wallaby 62 u žitnicu s peći, robotskim rukama za miješenje i staromodnom vjetrenjačom na krovu. Transformacija je savršena. Iako posao cvjeta, Gromit je zabrinut zbog vijesti da je desetak lokalnih pekara "nestalo" ove godine - ali Wallace se ne brine. On je previše rastresen i zaljubljen u bivšu ljepoticu i krušnu entuzijasticu, Piellu Bakewell. Dok oni uživaju, Gromit ubrzo shvaća da je život njegova gospodara u opasnosti te postaje detektiv kako bi riješio misteriozni slučaj u onome što ubrzo postaje "pitanje kruha i života".</desc>

For Bat fans and movie lovers alike; this is a must see.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1357915,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2005-06-16","keywords":"social decay,superhero,dc comics,gotham,well","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Batman Begins","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2992219161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDNjZDgzMmUtYTJkNS00ZDRlLWI5ZWUtNWJiYmEwNjFjZjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDNjZDgzMmUtYTJkNS00ZDRlLWI5ZWUtNWJiYmEwNjFjZjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Batman Begins","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913822/","name":"Ken Watanabe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038332/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004170/","name":"Bob Kane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275286/","name":"David S.

While The Dark Knight was more complex, more intellectually impressive, and The Joker was a more intimidating villain, I thought this movie did better with cohesion, evenness of pacing, and overall felt like a return to the neatly packaged story of Batman Begins. In fact, with the number of parallels the story and visuals had to the first film were almost *too* on the nose, but I think it still worked (but did we really need that a whole flock of bats *and* the shot of Bruce Wayne's father coming to rescue him? Also, what was up with Qui-Gon Jinn's force ghost randomly appearing??). The cast was once again a solid positive for this movie. Hardy's Bane, while far less impressive and a little more cartoonish than Heath Ledger's The Joker, served his purpose. Oldman continued to do a great job and Gordon-Levitt was a nice addition to the cast. Morgan Freeman was sidelined once again, though, leaving this cast blindingly white except for a few background characters who die. However, this cast also had a significant improvement over the previous two instalments in the trilogy: While the death of Rachel Dawes may have left Gotham woman-less at the end of The Dark Knight, both Hathaway's Catwoman and Cotillard's Miranda Tate were strong characters who were prominent throughout the movie and important to the plot. Could they have been a little better in their execution? Yes, although they were handicapped from being introduced for the first time in this movie compared to the men, and I thought the two added much needed balance to the cast's diversity as well as its motivations.\n\nThere was more heart in this than the previous two films, and it leaned into its emotional beats particularly in the ending. I would have liked more emotion throughout the series, and in contrast to the rest of this series the epilogue felt a little bit cheesy. Still, though, maybe that's okay.

The use of a well known Roddenberry plot device to reset the franchise was a brilliant idea and means the franchise can now move forward without the "FANS" shouting "canon!" The movie itself was brilliantly cast and performed with each actor being enough like the original to be believable in the role without the over the top acting that was part of TV when it all began in the 1960's.The special effects are top notch.\n\nIts a film which you can take anyone who enjoys sci-fi to, not just someone who knows the last 40+ years of Trek.\n\nSo what level of fan am I? I own 3 costumes, attend conventions and appear in "Trekkies 2", and yet loved Enterprise because from the first episode I simply said its was in an alternate universe, its the same but different. I view this film in the same light, same but different.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":589485,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-05-13","keywords":"disobeying orders,automobile,car,part of series,bra","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761608473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the final theatrical trailer for Star Trek, directed by J.J.

The use of a well known Roddenberry plot device to reset the franchise was a brilliant idea and means the franchise can now move forward without the "FANS" shouting "canon!" The movie itself was brilliantly cast and performed with each actor being enough like the original to be believable in the role without the over the top acting that was part of TV when it all began in the 1960's.The special effects are top notch.\n\nIts a film which you can take anyone who enjoys sci-fi to, not just someone who knows the last 40+ years of Trek.\n\nSo what level of fan am I? I own 3 costumes, attend conventions and appear in "Trekkies 2", and yet loved Enterprise because from the first episode I simply said its was in an alternate universe, its the same but different. I view this film in the same light, same but different.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":589485,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-05-13","keywords":"disobeying orders,automobile,car,part of series,bra","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761608473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the final theatrical trailer for Star Trek, directed by J.J.

After the emotionally charged story, and particularly the climax, of "Casino Royale", the bar was set very high for the follow-up.\n\nDoes "Quantum of Solace" deliver? Well, honestly, the answer to that depends almost entirely on what you were expecting. If you were expecting a lengthy, down-to-earth, 'realistic' ('plausible' is probably a better description for "Casino Royale") character-based revenge flick, "Quantum of Solace" is not it. What "Quantum of Solace" does is weave the characterization into the plot and action to the point where we don't have room to breathe. The criticisms against the movie for lacking in character development are downright absurd- it's all there, the movie just doesn't stop and explicitly tell you what it's doing. If you're paying attention to what Bond's doing throughout the film surely you will understand why he is motivated to do those things. It's pretty careful and refined writing from Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with the addition of script polisher/editor Paul Haggis). \n\nWhat "Quantum of Solace" doesn't do is deliver a repeat of "Casino Royale". I'm actually quite amazed at the venomous reaction to the film by fans who seem to adore the more humorous, faster-moving Bond films. I mean, this isn't exactly right up their alley, but it's sure as hell not as drawn-out and slow-moving (although I didn't feel that was a bad thing in CR's case) as "Casino Royale", it surely doesn't spend most of its time on the dialogue and characterization, and it surely isn't as significantly divergent from the Bond formula as that film was. This is, ultimately, not unlike several Bond films we've seen before. There's snarling foreign villains with accents, a shadowy evil organization with political motivations, there's plenty, plenty of action. The "Bourne" comparisons are especially confounding. So, because Robert Ludlum once took from the Bond character and stories to write his "Bourne" novels, the Bond film series can't go back to Bond's roots in Fleming's great novels for inspiration? I'd say that "Quantum" has more in common with Bond films of the past than any of the Bourne films. If they're talking about the action scenes here, then while they lack the coherence of some of the greatest action scenes in Bond history, they are still much easier to follow than anything in Greengrass' "Bourne" films. Outside the first 15 minutes there's barely anything here that resembles a Bourne film at all, actually. The first two action scenes- the car chase and foot chase- are over-edited for sure, but the rest of the action scenes are grand, particularly the plane scene and climactic action scene at the hotel. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film are all good, director Marc Forster doesn't mess up (which, given the quality of many of his previous films, was perhaps the greatest danger this Bond installment faced) the David Arnold score is not one of the great Bond scores, and his (or the producers') refusal to use an orchestral version of the score much during the actual film is quite frustrating, but it's quite good and certainly not among the worst scores the series has had. Craig is an absolutely superb Bond, Olga Kurylenko is a find Bond girl and fairly well-developed but not at the expense of Bond or the story, while Gemma Arterton's limited screen time is an unnecessary diversion. Arterton's not the only flaw here, the design is a bit naff at times, and there's several things that could have been done better, especially during the first 15 minutes, but the movie works as a whole, and it's not nearly as humorless as some are suggesting; there's some genuinely funny stuff here, without descending into over-the-top camp. Actually, "Quantum of Solace" sees a welcome return of a deadpan delivery to the one-liners which evokes Connery's best moments. No winking at the camera, no raised eyebrows, just the jokes. Felix grabbing a beer and looking nonchalant as the SWAT team tried and failed to capture Bond, Bond stealing the bike from under the informant ("I missed!"), Bond and M at the hotel... So many great moments. \n\n"Quantum of Solace" is perhaps not one of the great Bond films, and while I would not like to see "Quantum of Solace" become the template which the Bond series will follow in the future (it is only completely satisfying when taken in context as part of a larger storyline), it is still not just a good action thriller, but an often gloriously enjoyable Bond film, and a fine entry in the series. \n\n8/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":416107,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-05","keywords":"bond girl,attempted rape,official james bond series,official bond film,opera","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quantum of Solace: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1024524313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Quantum of Solace, directed by Marc Forster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0023832/","name":"Mathieu Amalric"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286975/","name":"Marc Forster"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353673/","name":"Paul Haggis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No honor among these slick reprobates, and good time is had by all the men and, this time, not Julia Roberts, but Clooney's real-life squeeze, Ellen Barkin, as Abigail Sponder, tough right hand to Bank.\n\nI go to most movies as a film critic with my sensibility well-guarded against the fluffy confection of just another heist.

Ocean's Thirteen reinforces its place in popular culture as a repository for our transitory adulation of movie stars and the escapes they gave us long ago.\n\nAt the end, Matt Damon exits with "See you when I see you," a fitting piece of noncommittal that may promise another Ocean's installment or just more star sightings. Clooney says goodbye to Pitt with an in-joke the world is in on: "Hey! Next time! Keep the weight off. Pitt retorts, "Have a couple of kids." This is typical of the low-key, sweetly narcissistic third installment.\n\nOcean's hits a lucky thirteen this time around without a big jackpot but a great deal of good will.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":331803,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"revenge,casino,heist,comeuppance,hubris","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Thirteen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1654522137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002718/","name":"Brian Koppelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505522/","name":"David Levien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ross je u agoniji jer briljantna, lijepa profesorica Charlie (Aisha Tyler) - koja obično više voli paleontologe - umjesto toga hoda s plitkim Joeyjem. Ipak, Ross pomaže očajnom Joeyju da se pretvara da je inteligentan kako bi impresionirao Charlie - što ima mješovite rezultate. U međuvremenu, Chandlerov i Monicin nervozan posjet klinici za plodnost neugodnijim učini neočekivana pojava Chandlerove dosadne bivše djevojke Janice (Maggie Wheeler). A Rachel se prepire s Phoebe oko lanca salona za masažu u vlasništvu korporacije koje se Phoebe gnuša.</desc>

Even with two cameo's this movie didn't make the heist.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200818,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-06-08","keywords":"released from jail,female protagonist,hacker,vomiting,diamond necklace","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135459097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI1YTI3Y2UtNTRmNy00OWNiLWJjOTQtMjU3ZWFlNzIzNjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWZlZGVyaWdh._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI1YTI3Y2UtNTRmNy00OWNiLWJjOTQtMjU3ZWFlNzIzNjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWZlZGVyaWdh._V1_.jpg","description":"Debbie Ocean gathers a crew to attempt an impossible heist at New York City's yearly Met Gala.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002657/","name":"Gary Ross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0702052/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002657/","name":"Gary Ross","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6035700/","name":"Olivia Milch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(hence all the "8" through "10" star reviews by people so dumb that they think we can't see their only account activity is to upshill this stinker!)","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-03-14","keywords":"clasp knife,based on video game,chase,female protagonist,jungle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590174745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ3MDc2N2MtZmU4OC00ZDVhLTgxMjUtNzVkYTk4NjkzM2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ3MDc2N2MtZmU4OC00ZDVhLTgxMjUtNzVkYTk4NjkzM2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she finds herself on the island where her father disappeared.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922035/","name":"Dominic West","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0324658/","name":"Walton Goggins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012385/","name":"Roar Uthaug"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102908/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4039044/","name":"Geneva Robertson-Dworet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322414/","name":"Alastair Siddons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2489193/","name":"Evan Daugherty"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With two failed adaptations, I think Bradbury's novel might come across better on the page than on the screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-20","keywords":"dystopia,book burning,flamethrower,emoji,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young girl...and begins to rebel against society.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

I almost stopped watching because a lot of ppl said they liked it after the pilot but I didn't like it until episode 4. After rewatching, it's not that the first 3 episodes are bad, it's that they're slow and are almost purely for building the world and characters, rather than really advancing much plot. That being said, the plot that they start with is rather jarring to try to jump into even with the background information they give, because they dole a lot out of out piece by piece or rather episode by episode. The special effects are definitely cheesy, but you get used to them pretty quick and they don't negate from the amazing writing.

I almost stopped watching because a lot of ppl said they liked it after the pilot but I didn't like it until episode 4. After rewatching, it's not that the first 3 episodes are bad, it's that they're slow and are almost purely for building the world and characters, rather than really advancing much plot. That being said, the plot that they start with is rather jarring to try to jump into even with the background information they give, because they dole a lot out of out piece by piece or rather episode by episode. The special effects are definitely cheesy, but you get used to them pretty quick and they don't negate from the amazing writing.
