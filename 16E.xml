The story has some layers to it and I am surprised to see that people did not appreciate that. Jack Carter is not a good guy. He is a bad man working in bad town doing bad things. Always was a bad guy. But he reaches a moment in his life when the things that take place  between him and his boss's girl Audrey, the things that he finds out about his brother and his brother's family, all of them act as a catalyst. For once in his life he tries to set things right. How does he do that? By doing what he knows to do. He does bad things. The guys he goes up against are a little a out of the reach of the law. To wait for justice to set things right is not a concept Jack is familiar with. The only things he knows is to take care of his own dirty laundry. And at the moment his life is his dirty laundry. He was not there for his brother, for his niece and he missed some oportunities... Time to set things right. But he does only bad things in this movie. He kills people by shooting them, by throwing them out of the balcony, by beating them up in the elevator. WHY? Because these are the same things that would happen to him if he let his guard down.\n\nGreat acting performances form most guys in the movie. Stallone seems to have found some serious acting genes within himself. This is some of his best work and his best is very good. Not only for the genre. Although when looking back at Oscar (his 1991 comedy), D-Tox (a very underrated movie) and Copland I have to say that this is not a one off. No sir. When the script, the director and the rest of the cast are good he can act big time. Michael Caine made a very good movie called get Carter back in 1971. I love that movie and is always one of my favorites to watch on Turner Classic Movies. The remake, I felt, is just as good. Sure it has the sort of usual happy ending, but that is just the American Way of ending action movies. They love a hero. Mickey Rourke, Alan Cummings, Michael Caine and Rachael Leigh-Cook are very good in this one.

The movie could have been done without him, without a doubt. But he did it because unlike other remakes, this one is just as good as the original. It has it's own style, a somewhat different story and a happier ending. Otherwise, they are two very similar movies.

The director, the cast, everybody got this movie and knew what they were making except for the producers who seem to have been thinking of another movie. Michael Caine seems to have given his seal off approval to Stallone's acting in this one. The producers wanted a classic 80's action movie. At least that's what I feel. So, this is a very good movie. Just as good (or almost as good, depending on how you look at it) as the original. It has great acting, sharp directing, nice car chase scenes, nice action scenes, some great moments, some wonderful music, a simple yet effective storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to see more.

Obviously as expected, the film illustrates a few stereotypes. For example, when Florrr's (played by Paz Vega) cousin, Cecilia hit the sliding glass door and her nose bled, the wife Deborah Clasky (played by Tia Leone) offered her money instead. It's sad but true in today's society.\n\nBut what make the film interesting are its subtleties. For instance the casting and the characters itself. The producers could have hired a blonde blue eyed male lead instead of Adam Sandler, but they did not. Why? Because Sandler's character (John Clasky) is an antithesis of the wife, Deborah Clasky. She's blonde blue eyed superficial, emotionally disturbed, patronizing, solipsistic, white housewife, who the writer ( Brooks )probably wants to portray as the epitome of everything that is bad about white people - or Americans for that matter (however exaggerated they portrayed her to be). You can empathize with the husband's character and Adam Sandler played it very well. It's interesting to note, the husbands character's last name is Clasky - possibly his ancestors were immigrants as well. And his character is portrayed as someone who "gets it", someone who understands Florrr - an immigrant mother who wants her daughter raised with her own values and integrity even though she is only a lowly servant to the Clasky's.\n\nOne of the interesting scenes in the film that I found very clever was the argument between Florrrr and John. It showed the two sides of the dynamic. While I was watching it I thought to myself, any other individual would immediately apologize and patronize the immigrant housemaid in the expense of goodwill. But I was surprised that Sandler's character actually called her a "hypocrite" instead, and she realized he has a point. Not to criticize her (it's probably what Deborah would have done) would be hypocritical as well. This is another social commentary that was written very well and cleverly portrayed in the film.\n\nThe acting is equally superb. You could just hate some of the characters specially the housewife and the daughter Cristina Moreno (played by Shelbie Bruce). You can just empathize with Adam Sandler's character and his daughter, Bernice. The only people amongst the Claskys that is very adult. The grandmother's character on the other hand (played by Cloris Leachman ) whose always drinking provides a respite to the insanity in the story and ironically always the unobtrusive and yet emphatic character despite how she lived her life. In the end she was the voice of reason for the wife.\n\nEqually, the dialogue is worth mentioning. Interestingly, there are no subtitles on all the Spanish spoken dialogue but the audience can kind of get the gist of what's being said or argued. It can be distracting to some audiences but thankfully, Florrr's character learned to speak English in the second half of the film. Also, the Spanish without subtitles added a few good scenes in the film and added a positive credence to the title SPANGLISH. It illustrates how to write the quintessential part of the screenplay without making it too cliché.\n\nOverall, I liked this film. If you can look at it in the same light as I saw the film, you would enjoy it too and find it cleverly written and directed. Otherwise, it could be a little slow and the dialogue can be a little bit distracting. It doesn't help some of it is in Spanish and Adam sandler's character cannot express himself very well verbally.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81730,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-17","keywords":"car,cadillac,cadillac escalade,jeep,jeep grand cherokee","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spanglish","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi462029081","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891895/","name":"Paz Vega"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000985/","name":"James L.

This film, while being more than "just" a good love drama, really impressed me. Many of the scenes are quite visually beautiful, some in cinematography, others in content. As a love drama, it's moving, and at times almost poetically beautiful. It involves three men, brothers, who are all in love with the same woman. She has a relationship with each of them, but ultimately realizes that she only loves one of them. The plot is very good, and evolves at the right pace for this type of story. Not terribly fast, but never stands still either. The actors all portray their respective characters well, nearly all of them giving a perfect performance. Anthony Hopkins is great, as always. There was not really anything in this movie that disappointed me. The ending scene involves some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There is a very emotional scene near the end which is also one of the most visually beautiful I've ever seen in a movie. I recommend this to most fans of love dramas, and, to a lesser extent, fans of war dramas. 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156147,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1995-01-13","keywords":"f word,no opening credits,violence,sex scene,sexual positions","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Legends of the Fall","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4019519769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3ODUxY2UtMzc0NS00YTc0LThjZGMtOGFiODdkODk4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3ODUxY2UtMzc0NS00YTc0LThjZGMtOGFiODdkODk4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001644/","name":"Aidan Quinn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001880/","name":"Edward Zwick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014925/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049012/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0793463/","name":"Susan Shilliday"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937074/","name":"William D.

This film, while being more than "just" a good love drama, really impressed me. Many of the scenes are quite visually beautiful, some in cinematography, others in content. As a love drama, it's moving, and at times almost poetically beautiful. It involves three men, brothers, who are all in love with the same woman. She has a relationship with each of them, but ultimately realizes that she only loves one of them. The plot is very good, and evolves at the right pace for this type of story. Not terribly fast, but never stands still either. The actors all portray their respective characters well, nearly all of them giving a perfect performance. Anthony Hopkins is great, as always. There was not really anything in this movie that disappointed me. The ending scene involves some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There is a very emotional scene near the end which is also one of the most visually beautiful I've ever seen in a movie. I recommend this to most fans of love dramas, and, to a lesser extent, fans of war dramas. 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156147,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1995-01-13","keywords":"f word,no opening credits,violence,sex scene,sexual positions","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Legends of the Fall","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4019519769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3ODUxY2UtMzc0NS00YTc0LThjZGMtOGFiODdkODk4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3ODUxY2UtMzc0NS00YTc0LThjZGMtOGFiODdkODk4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001644/","name":"Aidan Quinn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001880/","name":"Edward Zwick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014925/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049012/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0793463/","name":"Susan Shilliday","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937074/","name":"William D.

But Selleck pulls off the role admirably: this is the best playing of a role I've seen him manage. Kudos, Mr. Selleck - you made me forget you were Tom Selleck and had me, from the get-go, believing you were General Eisenhower.\n\nThe film isn't about the war, the SHAEF staff, or even the invasion itself: it's about Ike's superb organizing and planning brain and his ability, unique in history, to manage what was, to that date, the most unwieldy and potentially fractious warfare coalition ever to have joined hands as allies. Selleck and writer Chetwyn tell quite well how Eisenhower dealt with the frustrations and burden of his critical command.\n\nSure there are bits of created dialogue not to be found in the historical record and compressions of events and characters necessitated by the limits of cinematic storytelling, but on the whole this is a worthy film that achieves exactly what it set out to do: tell about Ike's grasp of the task set before him and his unparalleled aplomb in carrying it off.\n\nThe only egregious gaffe in the writing was the line spoken by Group Captain Stagg in which he tells Ike and the senior SHAEF staff that the low pressure storm systems, which boded ill for the launch of the invasion, depended on how much they'd be propelled by the jetstream. In 1944 the jetstream had not been discovered. Some prewar and wartime high altitude fliers had experience of the jetstream's effects, but meteorology had not yet identified the jetstream by name, or learned of its constant presence as prime determinor of weather aloft or at ground level. (If you think me wrong about this, see the PBS 'NOVA' episode about the late-1940's crash of an Avro Lancastrian airliner in the Andes Mountains.)\n\nThe only other objection I have to ALL films, to many otherwise comprehensive books, and to nearly all of the media reportage about the Normandy Invasion is the complete absence of mention of OPERATION NEPTUNE. NEPTUNE was the co-equal naval component of OVERLORD - which was the land component of the total SHAEF plan and operation. Without NEPTUNE there was, and could have been, no OVERLORD. Indeed the NEPTUNE planning gave SHAEF and Ike as many fits and starts and moments of intense anxiety as did any of the factors in the OVERLORD planning and execution. The two operations were, from the start of the invasion planning through its execution, akin to two hands being necessary to wash each other.\n\nA note to the IMDb reviewer who posted here that Field Marshall Montgomery was humorous and well-loved: this is simply not so. Most of Monty's associates - both senior and junior and both British and American - found him intolerant, rigid, insufferable, and the antithesis of humorous. It was also Monty's grave flaw that he prided himself as god's gift to generalship - a trait he shared with America's General Patton and which put Monty and Patton at loggerheads with each other throughout the war (Ike put up with much nonsense from both of them, and yet Ike's leadership managed to harness their talents to the task of achieving Allied victory). In his own plodding way Monty was a fine field commander, but he lacked completely what are today known as "people skills" - which lack disqualified him from being appointed supreme allied commander, which Churchill recognized long before it was necessary to appoint one. It was Ike alone among Allied commanders who had in spades all the people skills Monty and Patton lacked, as well as a near-perfect grasp of the leadership the Allied coalition, stacked as it was with prima donnas from every Allied nation, required in order for victory to be achieved over Nazi Germany.\n\n(By the way: let's all learn to spell "martinet," okay?)\n\nQuibble: Timothy Bottoms' work as Ike's able SHAEF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith is too easygoing. General Smith suffered from painful stomach ulcers and those who knew him did not mistake his ulcerous irascibility! Bottoms misplays Smith as a soft-spoken foil or private confessor to Selleck's finely etched Ike. Perhaps this soft Smith is artistic license since the film is not about Smith but about Ike, but I still feel that Chetwyn and Bottoms might have tried to give General Smith and his ulcers and his legendary suffer-no-fools-whomsoever wrath their historical due.\n\nMost importantly 'Ike: Countdown to D-Day' succeeds in a way that most historical films fail: it gives the sense that none of what we now as history was preordained or a done-deal, that the events that Ike dealt with were not easy or inevitable - or glorious. There is here real drama given life by fine portrayals of characters facing up to and dealing with the gravest doubts and tasks."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2004-05-31","keywords":"invasion,operation overlord,general,allies,preparation","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000633/","name":"Tom Selleck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000961/","name":"Timothy Bottoms"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0363553/","name":"Robert Harmon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056790/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019459/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077049/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156417/","name":"Lionel Chetwynd"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Selleck and writer Chetwyn tell quite well how Eisenhower dealt with the frustrations and burden of his critical command.\n\nSure there are bits of created dialogue not to be found in the historical record and compressions of events and characters necessitated by the limits of cinematic storytelling, but on the whole this is a worthy film that achieves exactly what it set out to do: tell about Ike's grasp of the task set before him and his unparalleled aplomb in carrying it off.\n\nThe only egregious gaffe in the writing was the line spoken by Group Captain Stagg in which he tells Ike and the senior SHAEF staff that the low pressure storm systems, which boded ill for the launch of the invasion, depended on how much they'd be propelled by the jetstream. In 1944 the jetstream had not been discovered. Some prewar and wartime high altitude fliers had experience of the jetstream's effects, but meteorology had not yet identified the jetstream by name, or learned of its constant presence as prime determinor of weather aloft or at ground level. (If you think me wrong about this, see the PBS 'NOVA' episode about the late-1940's crash of an Avro Lancastrian airliner in the Andes Mountains.)\n\nThe only other objection I have to ALL films, to many otherwise comprehensive books, and to nearly all of the media reportage about the Normandy Invasion is the complete absence of mention of OPERATION NEPTUNE. NEPTUNE was the co-equal naval component of OVERLORD - which was the land component of the total SHAEF plan and operation. Without NEPTUNE there was, and could have been, no OVERLORD. Indeed the NEPTUNE planning gave SHAEF and Ike as many fits and starts and moments of intense anxiety as did any of the factors in the OVERLORD planning and execution. The two operations were, from the start of the invasion planning through its execution, akin to two hands being necessary to wash each other.\n\nA note to the IMDb reviewer who posted here that Field Marshall Montgomery was humorous and well-loved: this is simply not so. Most of Monty's associates - both senior and junior and both British and American - found him intolerant, rigid, insufferable, and the antithesis of humorous. It was also Monty's grave flaw that he prided himself as god's gift to generalship - a trait he shared with America's General Patton and which put Monty and Patton at loggerheads with each other throughout the war (Ike put up with much nonsense from both of them, and yet Ike's leadership managed to harness their talents to the task of achieving Allied victory). In his own plodding way Monty was a fine field commander, but he lacked completely what are today known as "people skills" - which lack disqualified him from being appointed supreme allied commander, which Churchill recognized long before it was necessary to appoint one. It was Ike alone among Allied commanders who had in spades all the people skills Monty and Patton lacked, as well as a near-perfect grasp of the leadership the Allied coalition, stacked as it was with prima donnas from every Allied nation, required in order for victory to be achieved over Nazi Germany.\n\n(By the way: let's all learn to spell "martinet," okay?)\n\nQuibble: Timothy Bottoms' work as Ike's able SHAEF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith is too easygoing. General Smith suffered from painful stomach ulcers and those who knew him did not mistake his ulcerous irascibility! Bottoms misplays Smith as a soft-spoken foil or private confessor to Selleck's finely etched Ike. Perhaps this soft Smith is artistic license since the film is not about Smith but about Ike, but I still feel that Chetwyn and Bottoms might have tried to give General Smith and his ulcers and his legendary suffer-no-fools-whomsoever wrath their historical due.\n\nMost importantly 'Ike: Countdown to D-Day' succeeds in a way that most historical films fail: it gives the sense that none of what we now as history was preordained or a done-deal, that the events that Ike dealt with were not easy or inevitable - or glorious. There is here real drama given life by fine portrayals of characters facing up to and dealing with the gravest doubts and tasks.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2004-05-31","keywords":"invasion,operation overlord,general,allies,preparation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000633/","name":"Tom Selleck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000961/","name":"Timothy Bottoms"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0363553/","name":"Robert Harmon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056790/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019459/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077049/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156417/","name":"Lionel Chetwynd"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Obviously as expected, the film illustrates a few stereotypes. For example, when Florrr's (played by Paz Vega) cousin, Cecilia hit the sliding glass door and her nose bled, the wife Deborah Clasky (played by Tia Leone) offered her money instead. It's sad but true in today's society.\n\nBut what make the film interesting are its subtleties. For instance the casting and the characters itself. The producers could have hired a blonde blue eyed male lead instead of Adam Sandler, but they did not. Why? Because Sandler's character (John Clasky) is an antithesis of the wife, Deborah Clasky. She's blonde blue eyed superficial, emotionally disturbed, patronizing, solipsistic, white housewife, who the writer ( Brooks )probably wants to portray as the epitome of everything that is bad about white people - or Americans for that matter (however exaggerated they portrayed her to be). You can empathize with the husband's character and Adam Sandler played it very well. It's interesting to note, the husbands character's last name is Clasky - possibly his ancestors were immigrants as well. And his character is portrayed as someone who "gets it", someone who understands Florrr - an immigrant mother who wants her daughter raised with her own values and integrity even though she is only a lowly servant to the Clasky's.\n\nOne of the interesting scenes in the film that I found very clever was the argument between Florrrr and John. It showed the two sides of the dynamic. While I was watching it I thought to myself, any other individual would immediately apologize and patronize the immigrant housemaid in the expense of goodwill. But I was surprised that Sandler's character actually called her a "hypocrite" instead, and she realized he has a point. Not to criticize her (it's probably what Deborah would have done) would be hypocritical as well. This is another social commentary that was written very well and cleverly portrayed in the film.\n\nThe acting is equally superb. You could just hate some of the characters specially the housewife and the daughter Cristina Moreno (played by Shelbie Bruce). You can just empathize with Adam Sandler's character and his daughter, Bernice. The only people amongst the Claskys that is very adult. The grandmother's character on the other hand (played by Cloris Leachman ) whose always drinking provides a respite to the insanity in the story and ironically always the unobtrusive and yet emphatic character despite how she lived her life. In the end she was the voice of reason for the wife.\n\nEqually, the dialogue is worth mentioning. Interestingly, there are no subtitles on all the Spanish spoken dialogue but the audience can kind of get the gist of what's being said or argued. It can be distracting to some audiences but thankfully, Florrr's character learned to speak English in the second half of the film. Also, the Spanish without subtitles added a few good scenes in the film and added a positive credence to the title SPANGLISH. It illustrates how to write the quintessential part of the screenplay without making it too cliché.\n\nOverall, I liked this film. If you can look at it in the same light as I saw the film, you would enjoy it too and find it cleverly written and directed. Otherwise, it could be a little slow and the dialogue can be a little bit distracting. It doesn't help some of it is in Spanish and Adam sandler's character cannot express himself very well verbally.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81730,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-17","keywords":"car,cadillac,cadillac escalade,jeep,jeep grand cherokee","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spanglish","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi462029081","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891895/","name":"Paz Vega"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000985/","name":"James L.

A woman and her daughter emigrate from Mexico for a better life in America, where they start working for a family where the patriarch is a newly celebrated chef with an insecure wife." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0371246/","name":"Spanglish","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMzc0MjgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTgxOTk2._V1_.jpg","description":"A woman and her daughter emigrate from Mexico for a better life in America, where they start working for a family where the patriarch is a newly celebrated chef with an insecure wife.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0371246/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"kvonnegut","dateCreated":"2004-12-30","inLanguage":"English","name":"Interesting Social Commentary - SPANGLISH?","reviewBody":"SPANGLISH - a term with negative connotation to numerous Spanish-Americans (or at least to the first generation or older immigrants).\n\nAs the title implies, the movie makes a very interesting and subtle social commentary about the Mexican American dynamics/contrast in society. Obviously as expected, the film illustrates a few stereotypes. For example, when Florrr's (played by Paz Vega) cousin, Cecilia hit the sliding glass door and her nose bled, the wife Deborah Clasky (played by Tia Leone) offered her money instead. It's sad but true in today's society.\n\nBut what make the film interesting are its subtleties. For instance the casting and the characters itself. The producers could have hired a blonde blue eyed male lead instead of Adam Sandler, but they did not. Why? Because Sandler's character (John Clasky) is an antithesis of the wife, Deborah Clasky. She's blonde blue eyed superficial, emotionally disturbed, patronizing, solipsistic, white housewife, who the writer ( Brooks )probably wants to portray as the epitome of everything that is bad about white people - or Americans for that matter (however exaggerated they portrayed her to be). You can empathize with the husband's character and Adam Sandler played it very well. It's interesting to note, the husbands character's last name is Clasky - possibly his ancestors were immigrants as well. And his character is portrayed as someone who "gets it", someone who understands Florrr - an immigrant mother who wants her daughter raised with her own values and integrity even though she is only a lowly servant to the Clasky's.\n\nOne of the interesting scenes in the film that I found very clever was the argument between Florrrr and John. It showed the two sides of the dynamic. While I was watching it I thought to myself, any other individual would immediately apologize and patronize the immigrant housemaid in the expense of goodwill. But I was surprised that Sandler's character actually called her a "hypocrite" instead, and she realized he has a point. Not to criticize her (it's probably what Deborah would have done) would be hypocritical as well. This is another social commentary that was written very well and cleverly portrayed in the film.\n\nThe acting is equally superb. You could just hate some of the characters specially the housewife and the daughter Cristina Moreno (played by Shelbie Bruce). You can just empathize with Adam Sandler's character and his daughter, Bernice. The only people amongst the Claskys that is very adult. The grandmother's character on the other hand (played by Cloris Leachman ) whose always drinking provides a respite to the insanity in the story and ironically always the unobtrusive and yet emphatic character despite how she lived her life. In the end she was the voice of reason for the wife.\n\nEqually, the dialogue is worth mentioning. Interestingly, there are no subtitles on all the Spanish spoken dialogue but the audience can kind of get the gist of what's being said or argued. It can be distracting to some audiences but thankfully, Florrr's character learned to speak English in the second half of the film. Also, the Spanish without subtitles added a few good scenes in the film and added a positive credence to the title SPANGLISH. It illustrates how to write the quintessential part of the screenplay without making it too cliché.\n\nOverall, I liked this film. If you can look at it in the same light as I saw the film, you would enjoy it too and find it cleverly written and directed. Otherwise, it could be a little slow and the dialogue can be a little bit distracting. It doesn't help some of it is in Spanish and Adam sandler's character cannot express himself very well verbally.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81730,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-17","keywords":"car,cadillac,cadillac escalade,jeep,jeep grand cherokee","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spanglish","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi462029081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891895/","name":"Paz Vega"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000985/","name":"James L.

Well worth watching.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114685,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-04-07","keywords":"west virginia,bound and gagged,voyeur,voyeurism,flat tire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wrong Turn","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946026265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY3YjZjODQtMzNkZC00ZTZjLTg2NTMtN2UyN2NiNTk1ZTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY3YjZjODQtMzNkZC00ZTZjLTg2NTMtN2UyN2NiNTk1ZTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244630/","name":"Eliza Dushku","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004825/","name":"Emmanuelle Chriqui"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003343/","name":"Rob Schmidt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029749/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568416/","name":"Alan B.

Thankfully Burden of Truth gives her more compelling material, though sometimes only slightly. \n\nThe major downside of this series is that the story has been done many times before, big-city lawyer goes back to her small town and ends up getting wrapped into a mystery and staying. It's the plot of two dozen Hallmark movies and each time pretty much feels the same. The saving grace of the series is that the writing can pretty good, even if it's a play on old themes, and is performed to perfection by the cast. Ms. Kreuk consistently delivers incomparable performances in anything she's in, and Burden of Truth is no different. The show is easily worth watching for her alone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3656,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-10","keywords":"legal drama,attorney,court case,legal system,female protagonist","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0471036/","name":"Kristin Kreuk"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312105/","name":"Peter Mooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2868495/","name":"Meegwun Fairbrother"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121071/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466443/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800920/","name":"Brad Simpson"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Off the Field" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1975630617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NGViZWMtMzE0MS00MTI1LTg4YzAtNjdmYzcxMzFjYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NGViZWMtMzE0MS00MTI1LTg4YzAtNjdmYzcxMzFjYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"When it's suspected that her big-pharma client's vaccine has caused a mysterious illness affecting a handful of teenaged girls, high-powered attorney Joanna Hanley (Kristin Kreuk) returns to her hometown of Millwood to quickly and quietly settle the case."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully Burden of Truth gives her more compelling material, though sometimes only slightly. \n\nThe major downside of this series is that the story has been done many times before, big-city lawyer goes back to her small town and ends up getting wrapped into a mystery and staying. It's the plot of two dozen Hallmark movies and each time pretty much feels the same. The saving grace of the series is that the writing can pretty good, even if it's a play on old themes, and is performed to perfection by the cast. Ms. Kreuk consistently delivers incomparable performances in anything she's in, and Burden of Truth is no different. The show is easily worth watching for her alone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3656,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-10","keywords":"legal drama,attorney,court case,legal system,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0471036/","name":"Kristin Kreuk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312105/","name":"Peter Mooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2868495/","name":"Meegwun Fairbrother"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121071/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466443/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800920/","name":"Brad Simpson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Off the Field" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1975630617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NGViZWMtMzE0MS00MTI1LTg4YzAtNjdmYzcxMzFjYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NGViZWMtMzE0MS00MTI1LTg4YzAtNjdmYzcxMzFjYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"When it's suspected that her big-pharma client's vaccine has caused a mysterious illness affecting a handful of teenaged girls, high-powered attorney Joanna Hanley (Kristin Kreuk) returns to her hometown of Millwood to quickly and quietly settle the case."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nor that it plays just once per day, at 9pm, at my local Cineworld compared to five screenings per day for Captain Phillips, eight for Ender's Game and fourteen for Thor: The Dark World.\n\nBut Bill Condon's (Gods and Monsters, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn) film about Wikileaks founder and hero/pariah (delete according to your political stance) Julian Assange really isn't that bad. Take that as you will.\n\nNot really a biopic, The Fifth Estate takes a similar approach to Assange as The Social Network did with Mark Zuckerberg, looking more at the product of the man than the man himself. It consumes 8 minutes more of your time than The Social Network, feels twice as long, is far more arduous and will require just a single viewing, compared to repeat visits for the Facebook flick.\n\nTrudging through the meeting of the ultimate whistleblower Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Daniel Berg (Daniel Brühl), the explosion of Wikileaks in the public's perception, the shadowy deals with The Guardian and the fall out from countless exposés about underhand dealings from governments and corporations, The Fifth Estate spews out a huge amount of information but never quite manages to get down to the gritty truth.\n\nIt feels cluttered and more of a lecture than a movie and I'm not sure I know a great deal more about Assange now than I did yesterday. Too much has been shoehorned into its 128 minute running time but it still only glances over some of the highest profile matters surrounding Assange: the Bradley/Chelsea Manning revelations and the sexual misconduct allegation against Assange that have led to his exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nCumberbatch succeeds admirably in portraying Assange as an obsessive with a serious case of egotism and a lack of social graces or personal care. It's a fine performance and will be a revelation to those who know Cumberbatch only from BBC's Sherlock or Star Trek Into Darkness. He is eminently watchable and succeeds in making an unpleasant man fascinating to watch. Assange wrote an open letter to Cumberbatch hoping to dissuade him from portraying him on film in The Fifth Estate, a "wretched" film, a work of fiction "based on a deceitful book", and one imagines that, should a copy of the film reach him inside his 'prison' he'll be dismayed by the way he is portrayed. Perhaps he'll be magnanimous to concede that, nevertheless, it is a fine performance from Cumberbatch.\n\nMany of the other prominent actors don't fare quite as well. Brühl follows up his superb performance in Rush with a more downbeat character that he never really sinks his teeth into. Like Brühl, Alicia Vikander, Berg's love interest and just one of many thorns in Assange's side, has little to play with and her performance is smothered by the presence of Assange.\n\nBucking the trend, David Thewlis gives a pastiche of a Guardian journalist, more given to flouncing noisily into meetings and huffing in exasperation than acting. But Thewlis' performance is evened out by able turns from the new Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi, Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci, though with so many characters vying for screen time and Condon battling to squeeze in as much information as possible alongside some outdated 80s techniques (text across faces, anyone?), they, too are lost in the mêlée.\n\nThe Fifth Estate isn't a great film and it may not be terribly truthful (the jury's still out on that one) but, despite it's flaws, I still enjoyed it. Once! And maybe truthful representations aren't important.

A dramatic thriller based on real events that reveals the quest to expose the deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an Internet upstart into the 21st century's most fiercely debated organization." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1837703/","name":"The Fifth Estate","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY1MTY5NTg3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQyMjgwMDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A dramatic thriller based on real events that reveals the quest to expose the deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an Internet upstart into the 21st century's most fiercely debated organization.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1837703/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"TheSquiss","dateCreated":"2013-10-29","inLanguage":"English","name":"The truth may be in there somewhere.","reviewBody":"I tend not to read reviews until after I've watched a film lest they sway my opinion, but it wasn't hard to miss the nonchalance (that veers towards damnation) with which The Fifth Estate has been received. Nor that it plays just once per day, at 9pm, at my local Cineworld compared to five screenings per day for Captain Phillips, eight for Ender's Game and fourteen for Thor: The Dark World.\n\nBut Bill Condon's (Gods and Monsters, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn) film about Wikileaks founder and hero/pariah (delete according to your political stance) Julian Assange really isn't that bad. Take that as you will.\n\nNot really a biopic, The Fifth Estate takes a similar approach to Assange as The Social Network did with Mark Zuckerberg, looking more at the product of the man than the man himself. It consumes 8 minutes more of your time than The Social Network, feels twice as long, is far more arduous and will require just a single viewing, compared to repeat visits for the Facebook flick.\n\nTrudging through the meeting of the ultimate whistleblower Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Daniel Berg (Daniel Brühl), the explosion of Wikileaks in the public's perception, the shadowy deals with The Guardian and the fall out from countless exposés about underhand dealings from governments and corporations, The Fifth Estate spews out a huge amount of information but never quite manages to get down to the gritty truth.\n\nIt feels cluttered and more of a lecture than a movie and I'm not sure I know a great deal more about Assange now than I did yesterday. Too much has been shoehorned into its 128 minute running time but it still only glances over some of the highest profile matters surrounding Assange: the Bradley/Chelsea Manning revelations and the sexual misconduct allegation against Assange that have led to his exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nCumberbatch succeeds admirably in portraying Assange as an obsessive with a serious case of egotism and a lack of social graces or personal care. It's a fine performance and will be a revelation to those who know Cumberbatch only from BBC's Sherlock or Star Trek Into Darkness. He is eminently watchable and succeeds in making an unpleasant man fascinating to watch. Assange wrote an open letter to Cumberbatch hoping to dissuade him from portraying him on film in The Fifth Estate, a "wretched" film, a work of fiction "based on a deceitful book", and one imagines that, should a copy of the film reach him inside his 'prison' he'll be dismayed by the way he is portrayed. Perhaps he'll be magnanimous to concede that, nevertheless, it is a fine performance from Cumberbatch.\n\nMany of the other prominent actors don't fare quite as well. Brühl follows up his superb performance in Rush with a more downbeat character that he never really sinks his teeth into. Like Brühl, Alicia Vikander, Berg's love interest and just one of many thorns in Assange's side, has little to play with and her performance is smothered by the presence of Assange.\n\nBucking the trend, David Thewlis gives a pastiche of a Guardian journalist, more given to flouncing noisily into meetings and huffing in exasperation than acting. But Thewlis' performance is evened out by able turns from the new Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi, Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci, though with so many characters vying for screen time and Condon battling to squeeze in as much information as possible alongside some outdated 80s techniques (text across faces, anyone?), they, too are lost in the mêlée.\n\nThe Fifth Estate isn't a great film and it may not be terribly truthful (the jury's still out on that one) but, despite it's flaws, I still enjoyed it. Once! And maybe truthful representations aren't important. As Cumberbatch wrote in his response to Assange, " the film should provoke debate and not consensus." \n\nAnd in that, at least, The Fifth Estate succeeds admirably.\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39996,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-10-18","keywords":"internet,wikileaks,computer hacker,whistleblowing,news leak","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2566236441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDI2OTEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3OTc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDI2OTEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3OTc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A dramatic thriller based on real events that reveals the quest to expose the deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an Internet upstart into the 21st centuryÂ’s most fiercely debated organization.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117709/","name":"Daniel Brühl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4089358/","name":"Daniel Domscheit-Berg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3859582/","name":"David Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4816469/","name":"Luke Harding"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When I heard that a sequel was coming, I just hoped it would retain the magic of the first and it did, with a cherry on top! This movie invoked the inner child within me and was just a perfect viewing experience for this time of the year.\n\nThe casting was genius, featuring many well known British actors, in roles big and small. It was like a gathering of all the best of British, all having the best of time together. A huge hats off to Hugh Grant, pure brilliance!\n\nThe imagination that went into this movie and the skill that managed to put this across to the audience was second to none! You will find yourself being absorbed into this world and will not want to leave. I've read some people complaining that this isn't what London is like today, but this is exactly how London was in my childhood mind, where fantasy and reality met. Don't let go of your imagination, suspend reality and just enjoy.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie highly enough. You will laugh and you will cry.

When I heard that a sequel was coming, I just hoped it would retain the magic of the first and it did, with a cherry on top! This movie invoked the inner child within me and was just a perfect viewing experience for this time of the year.\n\nThe casting was genius, featuring many well known British actors, in roles big and small. It was like a gathering of all the best of British, all having the best of time together. A huge hats off to Hugh Grant, pure brilliance!\n\nThe imagination that went into this movie and the skill that managed to put this across to the audience was second to none! You will find yourself being absorbed into this world and will not want to leave. I've read some people complaining that this isn't what London is like today, but this is exactly how London was in my childhood mind, where fantasy and reality met. Don't let go of your imagination, suspend reality and just enjoy.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie highly enough. You will laugh and you will cry. Go see it, on your own, with your partner or with you family, you won't be disappointed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-11-10","keywords":"irish wolfhound,bear,hair salon,scissors,escape from prison","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3045242905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzViZDliMjItZDY3Ny00NWE5LTkzNTYtMWQwMWZiNzllNmI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzViZDliMjItZDY3Ny00NWE5LTkzNTYtMWQwMWZiNzllNmI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucy's hundredth birthday, Paddington sees a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruber's antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it.

The story on the surface is absurd and something you'd expect from a grade 'B' international intrigue thriller. Anne Parillaud plays Nikita, a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who is faster than a kung fu fighter and packs more punch than a Mike Tyson bite. She's killed some people and is given a choice between death and becoming an assassin for the French government.\n\nThis premise should lead to the usual action/adventure yarn, with lots of fists flying, guns going off, people jumping off of buildings, roaring through the streets in souped up vehicles, spraying bullets, etc., as blood flows and bones shatter. And something like that does happen. However there is a second level in which Nitika becomes the embodiment of something beyond an action adventure heroine. She is coerced and managed by society. Her individuality is beaten out of her so that she can be molded into what the society demands. She comes out of her 'training' with her individuality compromised, her free and natural spirit cowed, but undefeated and alive, and she sets out to do what she has been taught to do. And then she falls in love. And she notices, somewhere along the way, amid the murder and the mayhem, that there is something better than and more important than, and closer to her soul in this world than killing and being killed. She finds that she prefers love to hate, tenderness to brutality. She sees herself and who she is for the first time, but it is too late. She cannot escape. Or can she?\n\nParillaud brings a wild animal persona tinged with beauty and unself-conscious grace to the role of Nikita. Marc Duret plays Rico, the tender man she loves, and Tchéky Karyo is her mentor, Bob, whom she also loves. Jeanne Moreau, the legend, has a small part as Amande, who teaches Nikita lipstick application and how to be attractive.\n\nNow compare this to the US remake called Point of No Return (1993), starring Bridget Fonda. (Please, do not even consider the vapid TV Nikita.) What's the difference? Well, Fonda's flashier, I suppose, but nowhere is there anything like the psychological depth and raw animal magnetism found in the original. The Fonda vehicle is simply a one-dimensional action flick stylishly done in a predictable manner. Besson's Nikita is a work of art that explores the human predicament and even suggests something close to salvation.\n\nAs always with a French film, get the subtitled version. The dubbing is always atrocious, and anyway there's really not that much dialogue.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

His voice was amazing but his acting was off the charts. You could really feel his emotion and understand his thoughts. The rest of the cast was also stellar.

His voice was amazing but his acting was off the charts. You could really feel his emotion and understand his thoughts. The rest of the cast was also stellar.

Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy. He may be on your side, but you aren't sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity. Good luck, Henry. You're likely going to need it...","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1663205/","name":"Sharlto Copley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2247245/","name":"Haley Bennett"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5820154/","name":"Ilya Naishuller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042742/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0554941/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099734/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5820154/","name":"Ilya Naishuller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829901/","name":"Will Stewart"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is an important thing to say because Inside Llewyn Davis is certainly not a film to come to as a casual viewer just looking to kill a few hours – not as a snobby thing of "you'll not appreciate it" but just a reality that the film does almost nothing to help the viewer. The plot involves struggling folk musician Llewyn Davis in the Greenwich Village scene of the early 1960s; he is not particularly commercial, is irresponsible, downbeat and cannot look after others or even the cat belonging to others. We follow him over the course of a week which will change his life and see the world around him change too.\n\nI really did want to like this film because at times there is a certain beauty to it in the pained reality of its lead character, his situation and his gradual realization of where his life is and where it is going. Unfortunately this is generally spread very thin and instead of having a structure that supports this, we instead get an episodic approach that makes the "week" feel like months, sees characters just come and go whether we have an interest in them or not and generally doesn't allow you to do more than grasp at metaphors which drift by – usually resulting in the people who love the film the most being those who brought a lot of their own selves to the table, leaving us who look to the film to at least help, feeling left out in the cold and even a little bored.\n\nThe music is beautiful when it comes and the cinematography is excellent as it captures and shapes the feel of the film and the character – it is bleak to look at for sure, but it is suitable and effective for what the film is. The same could be said of Isaac's performance because it is what the film needs him to do but the downside is that it isn't really what the viewer needs him to do. His personal journey (physical and emotional) is made harder b the coldness of his character – there is really not much to grab hold of here and he is generally difficult. As often is the case with the Coens, we have characters drifting though the story usually in a colorful fashion – the times it has worked in other films has been frequent but here I didn't think it did at all, with nobody seeming to add much. As writers of the material and directors of their cast the "blame" (depending on your view) belongs with the Coens as they have made this film very difficult to get into.\n\nFull of supposed metaphors and with a sadness which is put in the distance look of its title character rather than in his heart or in the audience's line of sight, the film drifts along with a general sense of sadness and change which always interested me but just seemed deliberately out of reach and distant. I'm sure if you "get it" then it is a film to adore, but for me it just didn't work at all."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":146100,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2013-11-06","keywords":"false promise of the american dream,folk singer,new york city,musician,couchsurfing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1645979673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MzM0NDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyNTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MzM0NDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyNTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0413801/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2042568, Title: Inside Llewyn Davis, 
 --- Description: Inside Llewyn Davis: Directed by Ethan Coen, Joel Coen. With Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Ethan Phillips. A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2042568/","name":"Inside Llewyn Davis","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjcyNDQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU2NDA0MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2042568/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"bob the moo","dateCreated":"2014-03-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"There is a creative sadness in here, but it is heavily masked in sporadic plotting, hidden meaning and a dreary tone","reviewBody":"Like almost everyone who loved or hated this film, I do generally like the Coen brothers and am not against having to do work to enjoy and appreciate a film. This is an important thing to say because Inside Llewyn Davis is certainly not a film to come to as a casual viewer just looking to kill a few hours – not as a snobby thing of "you'll not appreciate it" but just a reality that the film does almost nothing to help the viewer. The plot involves struggling folk musician Llewyn Davis in the Greenwich Village scene of the early 1960s; he is not particularly commercial, is irresponsible, downbeat and cannot look after others or even the cat belonging to others. We follow him over the course of a week which will change his life and see the world around him change too.\n\nI really did want to like this film because at times there is a certain beauty to it in the pained reality of its lead character, his situation and his gradual realization of where his life is and where it is going. Unfortunately this is generally spread very thin and instead of having a structure that supports this, we instead get an episodic approach that makes the "week" feel like months, sees characters just come and go whether we have an interest in them or not and generally doesn't allow you to do more than grasp at metaphors which drift by – usually resulting in the people who love the film the most being those who brought a lot of their own selves to the table, leaving us who look to the film to at least help, feeling left out in the cold and even a little bored.\n\nThe music is beautiful when it comes and the cinematography is excellent as it captures and shapes the feel of the film and the character – it is bleak to look at for sure, but it is suitable and effective for what the film is. The same could be said of Isaac's performance because it is what the film needs him to do but the downside is that it isn't really what the viewer needs him to do. His personal journey (physical and emotional) is made harder b the coldness of his character – there is really not much to grab hold of here and he is generally difficult. As often is the case with the Coens, we have characters drifting though the story usually in a colorful fashion – the times it has worked in other films has been frequent but here I didn't think it did at all, with nobody seeming to add much. As writers of the material and directors of their cast the "blame" (depending on your view) belongs with the Coens as they have made this film very difficult to get into.\n\nFull of supposed metaphors and with a sadness which is put in the distance look of its title character rather than in his heart or in the audience's line of sight, the film drifts along with a general sense of sadness and change which always interested me but just seemed deliberately out of reach and distant. I'm sure if you "get it" then it is a film to adore, but for me it just didn't work at all.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":146100,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2013-11-06","keywords":"false promise of the american dream,folk singer,new york city,musician,couchsurfing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1645979673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MzM0NDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyNTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MzM0NDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyNTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0413801/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Other then that this is just one extremely bizzare fantasy film that I personally just couldn't recommend to anyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19570,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"post office,shot in the head,fighting,christmas,santa claus character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830914841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To save his declining business, Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson), also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military.

Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes, but it has to be said that both "Mr Smith" (the excellent Ed Harris) and the Girl (Saiorse Ronan) leave a lasting impression.\n\nI know there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the story, taken from a 1955 book by Slavimir Rawicz a former Polish army officer, and indeed what the group are supposed to have done looks impossible but that's not a problem, because the relationships ring true. It is remarkable how an almost random collection of individuals, including one with a very unsavoury past, can, driven by sheer necessity, wind up functioning as a team. Partly this is due to the leader actually having some navigational knowledge and therefore inspiring confidence in the others. Mr Smith remarks early on that the Janusz has a serious weakness; he is kind, but when the chips are down we see that even the hard-bitten Mr Smith is capable of compassion.\n\nStrangely enough, after the initial scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not a lot of drama. The group encounter very few people on their travels and those they do meet take little interest in them (perhaps they had not heard about the bounty for escapees). Obtaining food and water is obviously a big issue, so mind out for the messy hunting scenes. I was astounded at how well their footwear stood up to the punishment; my hiking boots are not good for 400 miles let alone 4000. Actually they must have wandered around a bit - the northern end of Lake Baikal and Lhasa in Tibet are about 1800 miles apart, though the prison camp was somewhere north of the lake. It's also not clear how long the walk took, but at times it seemed like years. Weir's great achievement is to keep us watching a very drawn out tale. Personally I think I would have died of boredom if I had been in this particular walk, if starvation hadn't got me first.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2011-01-21","keywords":"survival,desert,escape,long walk,oasis","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Way Back ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1465030937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyNzc5Mzc4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyNzc5Mzc4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young military officer (Sturgess) leads an escape from a hellish gulag in Siberia during WWII.

But the film's morality is more dubious than it recognises","reviewBody":"Director Gavin Hood's previous film, the underrated Ender's Game, focused upon the increasingly virtual, high-tech surveillance and disengaged nature of modern warfare. These elements of Ender's Game are clearly visible in the director's latest thriller offering, Eye in the Sky. The story here involves disparate groups of military and political personnel scattered around the world, all watching the live stream of a terrorist compound in Nairobi and debating whether or not to fire a drone into a heavily-populated ethnically Somali suburb of the Kenyan capital.\n\nThe operation is shown to be a joint British and American backed mission and the debate revolves around the collateral damage a drone strike would cause. The collateral damage is given a human face through a young girl who has set up a bread stall near the compound. Eye in the Sky's original title was "Kill Chain" and the reasoning becomes evident as the rest of the film involves people referring up the chain of command to avoid making a decision. The running time consists mainly of people talking to each other on phones and via video screens, however Hood manages to make these scenes some of the tensest, most cinematic, Skype calls you will ever see.\n\nEye in the Sky highlights the "hawk" and "dove" nature of the politicians of the two countries involved, one memorable scene being the US Secretary of State angry that his game of table tennis is interrupted because the British are dithering. However, the film's demonstration of realpolitik was weaker and has been presented far more successfully in Armando Iannucci's In the Loop, a film based on the run-up to the Iraq War. The film also lacked any strong, coherent argument against the drone strike apart from the contrived little girl selling bread nearby; not touching at all on the long-term consequences of dropping a bomb on a Somali suburb. The film reduces the complicated morality of drone warfare to a simplistic choice: it's either this little girl or a terrorist attack in a busy shopping mall. There's no concern however for civilians nearby who aren't cute children, or that the potential civilian casualties from this attack could be used by Al Shabab to garner more support amongst the population.\n\nAlan Rickman is fantastically dry in his last on-screen role as a British Lieutenant General and Aaron Paul is also very impressive, despite spending the majority of the film in a Portacabin with his finger hovering over the trigger. But while Eye in the Sky may be one of the year's most gripping thrillers, the film's morality is more dubious rather than ambiguous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-04-15","keywords":"drone pilot,terrorist cell,drone strike,terrorist,collateral damage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1137947161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"UK-based military officer Colonel Katherine Powell is in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya.

But the film's morality is more dubious than it recognises","reviewBody":"Director Gavin Hood's previous film, the underrated Ender's Game, focused upon the increasingly virtual, high-tech surveillance and disengaged nature of modern warfare. These elements of Ender's Game are clearly visible in the director's latest thriller offering, Eye in the Sky. The story here involves disparate groups of military and political personnel scattered around the world, all watching the live stream of a terrorist compound in Nairobi and debating whether or not to fire a drone into a heavily-populated ethnically Somali suburb of the Kenyan capital.\n\nThe operation is shown to be a joint British and American backed mission and the debate revolves around the collateral damage a drone strike would cause. The collateral damage is given a human face through a young girl who has set up a bread stall near the compound. Eye in the Sky's original title was "Kill Chain" and the reasoning becomes evident as the rest of the film involves people referring up the chain of command to avoid making a decision. The running time consists mainly of people talking to each other on phones and via video screens, however Hood manages to make these scenes some of the tensest, most cinematic, Skype calls you will ever see.\n\nEye in the Sky highlights the "hawk" and "dove" nature of the politicians of the two countries involved, one memorable scene being the US Secretary of State angry that his game of table tennis is interrupted because the British are dithering. However, the film's demonstration of realpolitik was weaker and has been presented far more successfully in Armando Iannucci's In the Loop, a film based on the run-up to the Iraq War. The film also lacked any strong, coherent argument against the drone strike apart from the contrived little girl selling bread nearby; not touching at all on the long-term consequences of dropping a bomb on a Somali suburb. The film reduces the complicated morality of drone warfare to a simplistic choice: it's either this little girl or a terrorist attack in a busy shopping mall. There's no concern however for civilians nearby who aren't cute children, or that the potential civilian casualties from this attack could be used by Al Shabab to garner more support amongst the population.\n\nAlan Rickman is fantastically dry in his last on-screen role as a British Lieutenant General and Aaron Paul is also very impressive, despite spending the majority of the film in a Portacabin with his finger hovering over the trigger. But while Eye in the Sky may be one of the year's most gripping thrillers, the film's morality is more dubious rather than ambiguous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-04-15","keywords":"drone pilot,terrorist cell,drone strike,terrorist,collateral damage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1137947161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"UK-based military officer Colonel Katherine Powell is in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya.

    <desc lang="hr">Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps: Directed by Oliver Stone. With Richard Stratton, Harry Kerrigan, Michael Douglas, Carey Mulligan. Now out of prison but still disgraced by his peers, Gordon Gekko works his future son-in-law, an idealistic stock broker, when he sees an opportunity to take down a Wall Street enemy and rebuild his empire." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1027718/","name":"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDEzMzYwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwMjUxMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Now out of prison but still disgraced by his peers, Gordon Gekko works his future son-in-law, an idealistic stock broker, when he sees an opportunity to take down a Wall Street enemy and rebuild his empire.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1027718/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"KnightsofNi11"},"dateCreated":"2011-08-09","inLanguage":"English","name":"A whole lot of nothing","reviewBody":"I wouldn't go as far to say that a Wall Street sequel was "long overdue" but it was more or less necessary due to the open ending of the first film. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps takes place more than twenty years after the events of the first film. Gordon Gekko is now getting out of prison after serving an eight year term for trading insider information. He meets a young Wall Street broker named Jake Moore, who is also his future son-in-law. He sees Jake's ambition and decides to aid him in his climbing of the Wall Street ladder. But, as would be expected from the sly Mr. Gekko, he has other intentions and we see almost a repeat of the first film, just set in the future coinciding with the 2008 stock market crash. It seems unoriginal but I think the only reason it works is because it is a fairly intriguing alternate reality take on an event we all witnessed.\n\nThis film starts out promising enough. Seeing Michael Douglas reprising his role as the infamous Gordon Gekkos is pleasing and putting his character in these modern times is interesting, as he is now no longer a huge name on Wall Street, and there are now crooks way more greedy than he ever was. The introduction of all the new characters is also interesting. Shia LaBeouf plays his eager young Wall Street fast talker role fairly well, not as well as Charlie Sheen from the original, but it's not bad. Carey Mulligan is as beautiful as ever and does a great job as Winnie Gekko, Gordon's daughter. Frank Langella even has a brief role as an older stock broker who doesn't have anything left to live for after the crash. However, great performances can only take a film so far.\n\nWhat Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps suffers from the most is just being really boring. It starts out so interesting and promising, but as the plot develops it eventually stops going anywhere and flat lines. This film doesn't help out the non-stock broker types like the original did. You have to know the lingo and you have to understand how Wall Street works and you need a lot of back story on the 2008 financial crash. I myself understand these things to a certain degree, but this film just moves too fast and doesn't let you keep up with the lingo and the fast talking. And so once you get behind you're behind for the whole film. I understood enough to follow the gist of the plot, but I also think that it is just too dull of a plot to really be that enticing whether you understand it or not. For a film that is over two hours long, it really goes nowhere after a certain point.\n\nThis isn't a terrible film, but it just doesn't really amount to much. There are some good things about it, like all the performances as well as Oliver Stone's direction. He pulls off some slick editing that gives the film a more technologically hip feel to it. If the film had kept with this same pace from start to finish it probably would have been a lot better. But when you boil it down there isn't much to see here and your mind moves right along as soon as the credits role.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100606,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"finance industry,businessman,stocktrader,stockbroker,stock market","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi875627545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTYwOTYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkxNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTYwOTYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkxNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Emerging from a lengthy prison stint, Gordon Gekko finds himself on the outside of a world he once dominated.

But this movie is a straight snooze job. I keep looking for something to spark my interest but no it's absolutely boring. God is it over yet??? Nope, 28 minutes left ","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":90836,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"female nudity,strip club,materialism,seduction,lap dance","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2881470233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJiZGIxN2YtODc0MS00NGM4LThkZWQtOWQ4MzA3MTFjNzAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJiZGIxN2YtODc0MS00NGM4LThkZWQtOWQ4MzA3MTFjNzAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the viral New York Magazine article, Hustlers follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2090422/","name":"Constance Wu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000182/","name":"Jennifer Lopez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005466/","name":"Julia Stiles"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032521/","name":"Lorene Scafaria"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0471026/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032521/","name":"Lorene Scafaria","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5658722/","name":"Jessica Pressler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12650986/","name":"Sarwar Ahammed Himel"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"It's not a ghost story. It's a story with ghosts." Leave it to writer/director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, 2006) to make this distinction. The line is spoken by our lead character Edith, who is striving to write like her literary idol, Mary Shelley. She is explaining her most recent writing effort to a publisher, but the line also represents the movie we are watching   ghosts appear (some grisly ones at that), but they certainly aren't the focus.\n\nThe story begins around the turn of the 20th century as young Edith has just experienced her first family tragedy, the passing of her mother. She grows into an independent young woman (played by Mia Wasikowska) being raised by her successful self-made-man father Curtis Cushing (played by Jim Beaver, "Justified"). Tip of the cap to del Toro for his tip of the cap to the horror film great Peter Cushing. Edith has remained steadfast in her independence despite the advances of her lifelong friend, the handsome Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam, "Sons of Anarchy"). Things change when a mysterious stranger sweeps into town. Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) seeks investors for his "clay harvester", a machine he designed to automate what now takes many men and much hard labor. The elder Cushing senses something is "off" about Sharpe and his sister and traveling companion, Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), but the strong-minded Edith soon finds herself waltzing and blushing with Sir Thomas.\n\nIt would be pretty easy to recap the balance of the story, but that is actually the film's weakness. It plays like a re-imagined script from one of those old 1940's or 50's movies that I watched on Friday nights as a kid. In other words, it's not very frightening and the viewer's enjoyment is totally based on the atmosphere. Fortunately, that's where del Toro and his team excel. The set design (Tom Sanders) and costumes (Kate Hawley) are truly spectacular and among the best ever seen, especially for a horror movie. Dilapidated Allendale Manor features a hole in its roof allowing the elements to freely enter the colossal entry foyer. The furnishings and fixtures, as well as the layout of the house are perfection as a setting. The costumes for all characters are superb, but pay special attention to the fabrics and frills of Edith and Lucille. Camera work from Cinematographer Dan Lausten ties it all together for the eerie feel.\n\nThe film is so stunning and interesting to look at that it's actually quite easy to forgive a story that has little to offer, and often   and I do mean often   relies on horror film clichés in what should be moments of difference-making. Having five such talented lead actors, who each go "all in" for their characters, help us overlook the script weakness, and it's really the look and atmosphere of the film that make it worth watching   not words I have written many times over the years.

The script and dialogue is very good, and you gotta love the (dog) characters!\n\nThe film featured some moments that had me belly-laughing and moments that just melted my heart. It never became sentimental or overly comical. The comedic moments were seriously funny. Wes Anderson pays great attention to detail and he obviously had a clear vision of what he wanted to portray. We don't always understand what the Japanese are saying, as they are not accompanied by subtitles, but that never mattered and - in fact - made it even more interesting, funny and unique.\n\n'Isle of Dogs' will go down as one of my all-time favorite movies.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":151064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2018-03-30","keywords":"robot,dog,japan,stop motion animation,scientist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2651502617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZkYzYwNmQtNjk3ZC00Y2M2LThhY2EtODIzOThiNDJmMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZkYzYwNmQtNjk3ZC00Y2M2LThhY2EtODIzOThiNDJmMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Isle of Dogs' tells the story of Atari Kobayashi, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi.

'Isle of Dogs' was absolutely incredible! It is a demented, unsympathetic and uniquely different film that is completely and utterly stunning! The stop-motion animation is great. The script and dialogue is very good, and you gotta love the (dog) characters!\n\nThe film featured some moments that had me belly-laughing and moments that just melted my heart. It never became sentimental or overly comical. The comedic moments were seriously funny. Wes Anderson pays great attention to detail and he obviously had a clear vision of what he wanted to portray. We don't always understand what the Japanese are saying, as they are not accompanied by subtitles, but that never mattered and - in fact - made it even more interesting, funny and unique.\n\n'Isle of Dogs' will go down as one of my all-time favorite movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":151064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2018-03-30","keywords":"robot,dog,japan,stop motion animation,scientist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2651502617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZkYzYwNmQtNjk3ZC00Y2M2LThhY2EtODIzOThiNDJmMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZkYzYwNmQtNjk3ZC00Y2M2LThhY2EtODIzOThiNDJmMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Isle of Dogs' tells the story of Atari Kobayashi, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi.

Shin-mi, transrodna žena, popularna je plesačica u gej klubu u Koreji. Voli je mala, ali posvećena baza obožavatelja, a uz potporu kolegice i mentorice "mame" Shin-mi pronalazi slobodu i zajednicu u ovom mikrokozmičkom svijetu koji ju je prigrlio bez rezerve. Nažalost, vanjski svijet ostaje hladan i nesklon promjenama, stvarnost na koju će se Shin-mi brzo podsjetiti nakon što je pozovu na polaganje ispita za obvezni vojni rok. Tijekom postupka ispitivanja, Shin-mi je degradirana i osramoćena, ali odlučna je zadržati jedinu moć koja joj je omogućena - svoj identitet.</desc>

In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous "war" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the "we won" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":298784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,berlin wall,west germany","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous "war" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the "we won" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":298784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,berlin wall,west germany","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":298784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,berlin wall,west germany","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"duration":"PT2H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron.

The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.\n\nHowever,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.\n\nTitanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancée,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}\n\nOverall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should.

Instead, I got a beautifully shot, smartly written, excellently acted, and a very "high quality" feel to everything. \n\nDare I say it, but I get slight Breaking Bad vibes from the cinematography and just the overall feel of everything. For example, the use of the music at the end of the pilot episode and the opening segment of the second episode that seemed random and unrelated to the main plot at hand. That isn't to say it feels ripped off, because it's not. It actually feels fresh and exciting to watch. Compared to most other shows this summer (example, The Last Ship) this is superior in every way conceivable, unless of course you're looking for the good guys blowing up the bad guys. \n\nThe second episode was just as impressive as the first. In fact, I actually watched it twice due to there being nothing else on TV. I never do that with anything.\n\nI sincerely hope WGN picks this up for another season. The fact that there are still under 500 votes on IMDb as of the second episode leave me a little worried about how the ratings fare.\n\nI guess the only thing the show could be doing better is having a better title sequence (think LOST, 24, Breaking Bad, etc. Just something simple but satisfying)!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8111,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has all the elements to make it an award winning piece. Great complicated characters that work well with each other, mystery, intrigue, excitement, shell shock, suggestive, authentic and genuine. Who new that Germany had the ability to produce a show like this that would compete with BBC period series. It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s. The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it. If you like time pieces and or like shows such as Endeavor, George Gently, Trapped, Modus and similar then you are likely to enjoy this program.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-10-13","keywords":"berlin germany,1920s,police,weimar republic,interwar period","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1432815/","name":"Volker Bruch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2939186/","name":"Liv Lisa Fries","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2914059/","name":"Leonie Benesch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061958/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044017/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359634/","name":"Henk Handloegten","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0902022/","name":"Achim von Borries"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2628238873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(If I could, I'd give it an 8.5) The premise is original and macabre, without veering into creepy. Each episode tells a concise story that's embedded within a larger unfolding story - so that at the end of 40 minutes you feel closure along with a sense of anticipation. The female character may be a bit anachronistic, but she's got moxie and she adds depth and color, literally - her blues really pop! Can't wait to see how the characters develop.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1145,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-05-15","keywords":"tv mini series,dark humour,murder mystery,serial killer,insane assistant","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0806968/","name":"Michael Smiley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4523680/","name":"Kerr Logan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3640226/","name":"Eileen O'Higgins"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0595504/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0503431/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162246/","name":"John Morton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1212071449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJkYmY1M2EtOGRiZS00MmQ1LWJmYzgtNjJkZjhkYzhmODZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJkYmY1M2EtOGRiZS00MmQ1LWJmYzgtNjJkZjhkYzhmODZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

Tom Selleck is maturing so well you almost forget about the youthful, carefree version of the actor. Today he carries a world weary, solid presence that makes him totally believable as Frank Reagan, the top cop of New York. The interactions between the younger Reagans are spot on and believable. Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan in particular are interesting and move the stories along. The rest of the cast is fine with only Len Cariou's role giving a slightly false note, not because of the excellent veteran actor, but because someone thought it would be cool to give him a limp and a cane... hmmmm, a retired older Irish cop with a bum leg and a cane, sounds slightly familiar -- I keep expecting Daphne to appear saying it's time for his therapy.\n\nSo far the stories have been solid one offs letting us get to know the lay of the land and the main characters personalities. The show is set in New York and the city is taking an important role. Thank goodness the producers didn't go with the Toronto as stand in for major US city route.

Tom Selleck is maturing so well you almost forget about the youthful, carefree version of the actor. Today he carries a world weary, solid presence that makes him totally believable as Frank Reagan, the top cop of New York. The interactions between the younger Reagans are spot on and believable. Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan in particular are interesting and move the stories along. The rest of the cast is fine with only Len Cariou's role giving a slightly false note, not because of the excellent veteran actor, but because someone thought it would be cool to give him a limp and a cane... hmmmm, a retired older Irish cop with a bum leg and a cane, sounds slightly familiar -- I keep expecting Daphne to appear saying it's time for his therapy.\n\nSo far the stories have been solid one offs letting us get to know the lay of the land and the main characters personalities. The show is set in New York and the city is taking an important role. Thank goodness the producers didn't go with the Toronto as stand in for major US city route. I love Toronto, but it always messes with my suspension of disbelief when a car cruises pass a major landmark like the Empire State Building and ends up on Yonge street.\n\nWe've been given heavy handed hints of the season's over arching story line -- the youngest Reagan is asked to infiltrate an inner circle of dirty cops called the Blue Templars.

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together.

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together. The sets and costumes are well done (suitable for the time period),and highly detailed. \n\nThe story line doesn't explore any real substantial questions of politics, culture, war, or social values...yet.

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

Some lean to being campy comedy like Moonlighting, others end up a murder of the week procedural like Castle, and others like Veronica Mars end up being side jobs they do while doing other things. Granted I LOVE all of those shows but it's been a while since there has been a good P.I. show where the characters are both actual P.I.'s with random cases to solve. Veronica Mars came the closest.\n\nHere we have a more realistic side to the P.I. life. I really don't care for spoilers myself and I don't want to spoil the plot so what I really need to say is... if you've hungered for a pure P.I. show with random cases this is what you've been waiting for. It does, again, air a little more on the realistic side but without being dark. Like how it's not realistic for Magnum P.I. to be doing a stakeout in a Ferrari. Or how it's not realistic for a writer to be involved in every murder that goes through a precinct in Castle.

Some lean to being campy comedy like Moonlighting, others end up a murder of the week procedural like Castle, and others like Veronica Mars end up being side jobs they do while doing other things. Granted I LOVE all of those shows but it's been a while since there has been a good P.I. show where the characters are both actual P.I.'s with random cases to solve. Veronica Mars came the closest.\n\nHere we have a more realistic side to the P.I. life. I really don't care for spoilers myself and I don't want to spoil the plot so what I really need to say is... if you've hungered for a pure P.I. show with random cases this is what you've been waiting for. It does, again, air a little more on the realistic side but without being dark. Like how it's not realistic for Magnum P.I. to be doing a stakeout in a Ferrari. Or how it's not realistic for a writer to be involved in every murder that goes through a precinct in Castle. Or how it's not realistic for a man to take the name Remington Steele so the female P.I. can solve cases that only the big boys get. So anyone that appreciates those kinds of little touches should, like me, find a lot to love with Private Eyes.

When the film wraps, it leaves you wanting nothing but for Abe Applebaum's next mystery.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-16","keywords":"voice over narration,private detective,small town,african american policeman,camera shot from inside a closet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Kid Detective [Trailer]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3983655193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A once-celebrated kid detective (Adam Brody), now 31, continues to solve the same trivial mysteries between hangovers and bouts of self-pity.

Glavni likovi ove mračno zabavne proceduralne drame su usko specijalizirana forenzična antropologinja dr. Brennan i agent FBI-a Seeley Booth.

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti.

At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.\n\nWhat's a man to do?\n\nI rather liked "Dan In Real Life", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. If you cannot accept it, fear not, "Get Smart" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good.\n\n"Dan In Real Life" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.\n\nI hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.\n\nWhat's a man to do?\n\nI rather liked "Dan In Real Life", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. If you cannot accept it, fear not, "Get Smart" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good.\n\n"Dan In Real Life" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.\n\nI hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That's to say, Ford appears, acts and just plain feels like he should be President. (Come one who saw this movie and wanted him to run). Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain (Ivan) should be up there with the likes of Alan Rickman's Hans from Die Hard and John Malkovich's Leary-Booth-Carney from In the Line of Fire (coincidentally directed by Wolfgang Peterson as well). Glenn Close pulls of the Vice President role with smirks and spunk.\n\nStars aside I think the supporting cast should get an equal if not harder pat on the back. These guys and girls . really made the movie. They're the ones that brought the chuckles and caused gasps. Wendy Crewson (The Good Son) nailed her role with more grace than a first lady has actually shown in the last recallable years. Paul Guilfoyle ("CSI", The Negotiator), was the kind gentle, "best buddy", chief-of-staff, who brought a small smile to your face every time he is on-screen. Xander Berkeley ("24", Terminator 2), plays the chilling secret service agent Gibbs. The lovable William H. Macy plays the good-mannered Air Force Officer who puts himself in harm's way for the President more time than the Secret Service agents do. He just doesn't get enough screen time toward the beginning. And Dean Stockwell will have you cussing under your breath as the power-hungry Secretary of Defense. And it seems that Wolfgang Peterson watched every great Action/Military movie of the past 3 years and hired all those "briefing room generals". For this I applaud him. As for the terrorist, they rival those of Die hard. Cold, stone-faced, funny, smooth, and just plain hateable, they did their job.\n\nThe bulk of the movie takes place aboard the Air Force One no kidding eh?). And boy do you believe it. The production designer (Williams Sandell) obviously paid attention to detail, mimicking the real Presidential Aircraft. Small, claustrophobic and believable.\n\nAndrew W. Marlowe's script gets it job done as well. Nothing award winning. It's everything you would expect given the story it has to tell. Couple times it will make you cringe, but again, look what it needs to accomplish.\n\nThe late Jerry Goldsmith's score for this movie is a hands down classic. Only having two weeks to score the film after Peterson rejected Randy Newman's work, Goldsmith with the help of Joel Mcneely composed one of the most bombastic, riveting, emotional, suspenseful, and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.\n\nA few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the "It's just a movie" mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Harrison Ford for President.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187360,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-07-25","keywords":"airplane hijacking,terrorist,terrorism,vietnam war veteran,first lady of the united states of america","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3680287513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000335/","name":"Glenn Close"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005233/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

The Vice President negotiates from Washington D.C., while the President, a Veteran, fights to rescue the hostages on board.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0118571/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Alvsy007","dateCreated":"2005-03-07","inLanguage":"English","name":"It is what it is......fun","reviewBody":"Nonstop action, thrilling suspense, dark humor, and a brilliant concept, this flag waving over the top action adventure was a good two hours in 1997.\n\nThe story: Enroute back to the States from Russia, Russian Nationals hijack the President's plane and hold him and his family (as well as most of his staff) hostage aboard Air Force One in order to release a Rouge General captured earlier.\n\nHarrison Ford from his first minute to his last looks comfortable in his Presidential role. That's to say, Ford appears, acts and just plain feels like he should be President. (Come one who saw this movie and wanted him to run). Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain (Ivan) should be up there with the likes of Alan Rickman's Hans from Die Hard and John Malkovich's Leary-Booth-Carney from In the Line of Fire (coincidentally directed by Wolfgang Peterson as well). Glenn Close pulls of the Vice President role with smirks and spunk.\n\nStars aside I think the supporting cast should get an equal if not harder pat on the back. These guys and girls . really made the movie. They're the ones that brought the chuckles and caused gasps. Wendy Crewson (The Good Son) nailed her role with more grace than a first lady has actually shown in the last recallable years. Paul Guilfoyle ("CSI", The Negotiator), was the kind gentle, "best buddy", chief-of-staff, who brought a small smile to your face every time he is on-screen. Xander Berkeley ("24", Terminator 2), plays the chilling secret service agent Gibbs. The lovable William H. Macy plays the good-mannered Air Force Officer who puts himself in harm's way for the President more time than the Secret Service agents do. He just doesn't get enough screen time toward the beginning. And Dean Stockwell will have you cussing under your breath as the power-hungry Secretary of Defense. And it seems that Wolfgang Peterson watched every great Action/Military movie of the past 3 years and hired all those "briefing room generals". For this I applaud him. As for the terrorist, they rival those of Die hard. Cold, stone-faced, funny, smooth, and just plain hateable, they did their job.\n\nThe bulk of the movie takes place aboard the Air Force One no kidding eh?). And boy do you believe it. The production designer (Williams Sandell) obviously paid attention to detail, mimicking the real Presidential Aircraft. Small, claustrophobic and believable.\n\nAndrew W. Marlowe's script gets it job done as well. Nothing award winning. It's everything you would expect given the story it has to tell. Couple times it will make you cringe, but again, look what it needs to accomplish.\n\nThe late Jerry Goldsmith's score for this movie is a hands down classic. Only having two weeks to score the film after Peterson rejected Randy Newman's work, Goldsmith with the help of Joel Mcneely composed one of the most bombastic, riveting, emotional, suspenseful, and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.\n\nA few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the "It's just a movie" mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Harrison Ford for President.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187360,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-07-25","keywords":"airplane hijacking,terrorist,terrorism,vietnam war veteran,first lady of the united states of america","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3680287513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000335/","name":"Glenn Close"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005233/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook! ....................................\n\nShame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.\n\nThe movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.\n\nWall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the "Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?" Department.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook! ....................................\n\nShame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.\n\nThe movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.\n\nWall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the "Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?" Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialog for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious.\n\nFortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the recent years.

I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).\n\nI enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.\n\nI don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.\n\nLet's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a "Jekyll and Hyde"-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise.

I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).\n\nI enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.\n\nI don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.\n\nLet's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a "Jekyll and Hyde"-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The next thing you know, friends of the four are being murdered left and right and these four become the killer's next targets.\n\nThe plot is fair, but not especially interesting.

Ann Heche is very good in the part that she has.\n\nThe characters, aside from Hewitt, Gellar and Heche, are very thin and rather boring. The killer himself is pretty interesting and fairly cool.

Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found "Meet the Fockers" quite funny.\n\nDon't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off, the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name "Focker". It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious low-down gags.\n\nFocker is the family name for Greg (Focker), Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers, however, (now I'm doing it) are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz, a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the "zaftig" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.\n\nGreg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.\n\nSo, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see "Meet the Fockers". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long.

Once you get a look at the enormous smile on Xi's face, you'll forget all of that. This is one of the most gentle, pleasant, and likable movies I've seen in a long time (all of that in a good way).\n\nI'd always heard about it, but somehow managed to miss it over the years. Finally saw it this weekend, and it's a real gem. \n\nFor you DVD viewers, there's a documentary with interview footage of Xi. The only problem--no subtitles! Some bozo obviously blew it on the transfer, making it possibly the most frustrating doc ever produced...Be warned!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54192,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1980-09-10","keywords":"junk,junk food,multinational corporation,pop,pop bottle","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618452/","name":"N!xau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923366/","name":"Marius Weyers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697865/","name":"Sandra Prinsloo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371059/","name":"Jamie Uys"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0618364/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179292/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371059/","name":"Jamie Uys"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.\n\nWell, if you're familiar with Kaufman's work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself "What the hell is going on?", but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I'm glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel's head.\n\nIf you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.\n\nBut if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that's beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he's smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you with it's originality and it's poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.\n\nMichel Gondry's use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers. \n\nEternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of "Best of 2004".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":948125,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-03-19","keywords":"memory,loneliness,nonlinear timeline,valentine's day,beach","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2292515097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA4YjQ5ZjEtMGQ4Mi00NWExLTkxMGQtNzAwYzVmNTU1ODJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA4YjQ5ZjEtMGQ4Mi00NWExLTkxMGQtNzAwYzVmNTU1ODJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929489/","name":"Tom Wilkinson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017525/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017713/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0442109/","name":"Charlie Kaufman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1410028/","name":"Pierre Bismuth"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are very few; and unless you're jonesing for a mere-nonsense 'entertainment' movie, this movie should appeal to practically anyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148464,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-13","keywords":"marriage,hotel,hotel room,writer,dinner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4026246681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTEzMjcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2NzIzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTEzMjcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2NzIzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"We meet Celine and Jesse 9 years on.

There's a complexity to their characters and relationship that refuses to fully romanticize or demonize them. It's something of a realist romance in (deliberate) contrast the beautiful settings.

This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest. \n\nI am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epic nature of the true story. \n\nThe characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together.\n\nMy rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling.

But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down. This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest. \n\nI am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epic nature of the true story. \n\nThe characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together.\n\nMy rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling. If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.\n\nLike some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.\n\nEspecially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.\n\nAs enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.\n\nHowever, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.\n\nVaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.\n\nAction-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.\n\nRegarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.\n\nOne has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.\n\nIn conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":291095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"fighting,one against many,man cut in half,spy,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi734968089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When their headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, the Kingsman's journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the US.

Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...\n\nA fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief.

Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...\n\nA fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting.

Mia decides to take drastic action to try and save Charlie from that fate.\n\nThere is a good "extra" on the disc telling about the process and what had to be done to train the lion to become the young actress' friend and not eat her.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2018-12-24","keywords":"singing in a car,girl lion relationship,animal in title,pet lion,white lion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3207183129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444538/","name":"Daniah De Villiers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491259/","name":"Mélanie Laurent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456810/","name":"Langley Kirkwood"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058643/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0461578/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049118/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444537/","name":"Prune de Maistre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.\n\nFor everyone else: don't you dare miss it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1730543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-03-13","keywords":"ring,quest,hobbit,epic,elf","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

U posebnoj epizodi Phoebena planerica vjenčanja, Monica, izluđuje sve oko sebe - sve dok joj Phoebe ne da otkaz. Veliki Phoeben dan pretvara se u katastrofu jer dostave ne stižu, a mećava mijenja planove. U međuvremenu, kao zamjena za Phoebena oca koji je u zatvoru, Joey svoju ulogu u obredu shvaća previše ozbiljno. Također, Chandler i Ross lobiraju kod Rachel da izabere jednog od njih za djevera u posljednjem trenutku u onome što obećava biti najneobičnija vjenčana povorka.</desc>

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

The film was foot-tapping fun and the dark turn it took in the third act, while unexpected, made it edgy and different for me. When a sequel was announced, I thought it seemed unnecessary.

After viewing the sequel, it very much does seem unnecessary and wholly forgettable within ten minutes after you walk out of the theater, which is disappointing to say the least. Other than this, the main problem with HAPPY FEET 2 is that there aren't that many good musical numbers as compared to the first one. Most of them are pretty mediocre.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

(hence all the "8" through "10" star reviews by people so dumb that they think we can't see their only account activity is to upshill this stinker!)","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-03-14","keywords":"clasp knife,based on video game,chase,female protagonist,jungle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590174745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ3MDc2N2MtZmU4OC00ZDVhLTgxMjUtNzVkYTk4NjkzM2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ3MDc2N2MtZmU4OC00ZDVhLTgxMjUtNzVkYTk4NjkzM2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she finds herself on the island where her father disappeared.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922035/","name":"Dominic West","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0324658/","name":"Walton Goggins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012385/","name":"Roar Uthaug"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102908/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4039044/","name":"Geneva Robertson-Dworet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322414/","name":"Alastair Siddons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2489193/","name":"Evan Daugherty"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Veliki Phoeben dan pretvara se u katastrofu jer dostave ne stižu, a mećava mijenja planove.

They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well.

And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\n\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\n\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":430108,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-10-27","keywords":"afterlife,day of the dead,mexico,musician,death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4249729305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVmZWZiZDktYWViMS00MzM4LWFjYWQtYjU1ODgwNGQzNWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVmZWZiZDktYWViMS00MzM4LWFjYWQtYjU1ODgwNGQzNWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Despite his family's baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz.

Danny McBride ("Zamjenici") vraća se na HBO humorističnom serijom o svjetski poznatoj televangelističkoj obitelji s dugom tradicijom devijantnosti, pohlepe i dobrotvornog rada - sve u ime Isusa Krista. McBride će glumiti glavni lik Jesseja Gemstonea, koji sebe smatra osobenjakom među propovjednicima preuzevši ono što je njegov otac Eli Gemstone (John Goodman) izgradio i proširivši to za moderniju publiku. Glumačka postava također uključuje Edi Patterson kao Jessejevu sestru Judy; Cassidy Freeman kao Jessejevu ženu Amber; Tonyja Cavalera kao bivšeg sotonista Keefea Chambersa, kojega je spasio Jessejev mlađi brat Kelvin (Adam Devine); Tima Baltza kao Judyna zaručnika B. J.-a; i Grega Alana Williamsa kao Martina Imarija, konzervativnoga Kenijca i Elievu desnu ruku.</desc>

In the near-future Glascow city, they'll have to fight against cutthroats, a band of depraved crazies thirsty for blood and survive some battles to-the-death.\n\nThis exciting movie is packed with noisy action, unbelievable car stunts, tension, thrills, chills, and lots of blood and gore, including throating-slit ,beheading, impaling and cannibalism. The story is a blend of classic Sci-Fi movies as ¨Escape from N.Y.¨, ¨27 Days/Weeks later¨ and of course ¨Mad Max¨, taking parts here and there. Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tyler Bates. Colorful cinematography reflecting splendidly the Scotland outdoors in which resides the Doctor Kane and where he has built a medieval world. The motion picture is well directed by Neal Marshall (Descent, Dog soldiers) but with no originally because he has copied previous films. This remarkable action film appeal to science fiction buffs","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75290,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-16","keywords":"quarantine,britain,reference to the warriors,virus,wall","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Doomsday","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1269956889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1NzM0NjkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYyNzkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1NzM0NjkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYyNzkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Doomsday Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593961/","name":"Rhona Mitra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001364/","name":"Bob Hoskins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796502/","name":"Alexander Siddig"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551076/","name":"Neil Marshall"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123433/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059753/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004724/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551076/","name":"Neil Marshall"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
