This is cinematic magic, with Blethyn turning in one of the most breathtaking performances ever seen on the silver screen. The transformation into Cynthia Purley is total.

The dialogue is a bit ropey at times, and Robin's "merry men" could have had a bit more screen time, but otherwise i see no major fault with this movie.\n\nAll in all a refreshing, exciting, fun, entertaining, nothing that you wouldn't expect from the pairing of Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-12","keywords":"archer,robin hood character,england,1190s,king of england","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin Hood: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi73860121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of an archer in the army of Richard Coeur de Lion who fights against the Norman invaders and becomes the legendary hero known as Robin Hood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0717550/","name":"Ethan Reiff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0903456/","name":"Cyrus Voris"],"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Many people didn't like this motion picture because of its liberal subtext.  That doesn't make it a bad film.  Most people don't realize that this was a Canadian production and that probably explains the political slant.  However, as action films go, it was intelligent, high tech, stimulating, bordering on believable (seldom are action flicks actually believable), with plenty of violence.  I didn't particularly agree with its `New World Order' message, but it was still a solid film.\n\nThe main criticism I have of the film is the editing.  In an attempt to make the story more intriguing, it is pasted together in a convoluted way that makes it very difficult to follow.  All the factions and motivations are eventually explained, but one has to pay very close attention or see the movie a few times to catch them all.  The screenplay suffers from an excess of subplots, which makes following the story that much more difficult.  The biggest sin committed by the producers and director was that they did not understanding their audience.  This film targets action lovers, who are a visceral lot.  They want to be stimulated, not confused and intrigued.  They also tend to be more conservative politically (God, Guns, Guts).  So naturally, the film bombed.\n\nWesley Snipes delivers a strong performance in the intelligent action hero role.  Snipes seems to be locked in the action genre when he is really too bright for the roles he plays.  He should take a lesson from Samuel L. Jackson and look for scripts that are more dramatic.  Jackson still does action films (Shaft), but he picks parts portraying complex characters and scripts with strong character development, instead of straight macho testosterone parts.  Snipes would have done well in some of the roles Jackson has had.  Anne Archer does a fine job as the manipulative career diplomat, pulling everyone's strings behind the scenes.  Donald Sutherland is a bit flaccid in this film, but his character really didn't have a lot of bite.\n\nOverall, this film is a strong entry into a genre dominated by mindless body count.  I rated it an 8/10.  Those who like their action flicks to be completely believable subtract two points.  Subtract another two points for those who don't like confounding story lines.  For those who abhor screen violence, don't even bother.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-08-25","keywords":"hero murders a woman,nude wears eyeglasses,fbi federal bureau of investigation,motor vehicle,car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Art of War","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1820918041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhZjllMDUtODkzYi00NTc0LTg0YTctMTFjNTljY2ZiYWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhZjllMDUtODkzYi00NTc0LTg0YTctMTFjNTljY2ZiYWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000648/","name":"Wesley Snipes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000271/","name":"Anne Archer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001999/","name":"Maury Chaykin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240995/","name":"Christian Duguay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078451/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0063511/","name":"Wayne Beach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058164/","name":"Simon Barry"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web.\n\nI would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clichés, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well.\n\nThere are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role.\n\nI'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-07-28","keywords":"computer,identity,identity theft,computer hacker,chat room","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Net","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2046230809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlkNjAzMDctYTY2YS00NGJkLTkxNGUtNDEyMGFiNjkwYjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlkNjAzMDctYTY2YS00NGJkLTkxNGUtNDEyMGFiNjkwYjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000562/","name":"Jeremy Northam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588222/","name":"Dennis Miller"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web.\n\nI would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clichés, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well.\n\nThere are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role.\n\nI'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-07-28","keywords":"computer,identity,identity theft,computer hacker,chat room","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Net","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2046230809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlkNjAzMDctYTY2YS00NGJkLTkxNGUtNDEyMGFiNjkwYjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlkNjAzMDctYTY2YS00NGJkLTkxNGUtNDEyMGFiNjkwYjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000562/","name":"Jeremy Northam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588222/","name":"Dennis Miller"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In that manner, Wrong Turn is actually a little nostalgic, not unlike the rest of the recent batch of backwoods horror flicks (Cabin Fever, House of 1000 Corpses, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake).\n\nBut aside from two solid setpieces, the movie rarely fulfills its (admittedly limited) potential. The script matters little in this subgenre, but there's almost no plot after the ill-fated teens arrive at the mountain men's cabin. This is about twenty-five minutes into the film, after we've already dispensed with the obligatory character intros (basically: 3 hot chicks and 3 hunky, but also surprisingly personable guys) and whatever reasons they have for being stranded in the middle of nowhere, West Virginia.\n\nEverything after that is typical cat-and-mouse filler, the killers (three inbred, cannibalistic hillbillies) searching for their prey while our protagonists run and hide behind trees. There's very little in the way of suspense, namely because it's so obvious who's going to live and who's going to die and in what order. And because the cast is so small, you can't even enjoy a particularly large body count (half the main cast is killed off less than forty minutes into the picture).\n\nWrong Turn is also missing much of what makes slasher movies fun to watch: explicit nudity and the occasional bit of gratuitous sex. With such an attractive cast (Emmanuelle Chriqui is cute, and Eliza Dushku and especially Lindy Booth are total hotties), the movie regrettably skimps on the goods. Such a complaint probably wouldn't matter if the characters were better developed, but despite a talented cast, the most interesting aspect character-wise is noting how different a couple Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers played in Dawn of the Dead. \n\nAs for the rest of the cast, Desmond Harrington is a solid actor, but does little more than run, grunt, and dive headfirst into every dangerous stunt (his volunteering for every dangerous move actually makes him pretty likable even when we question his logic). Eliza Dushku simply coasts on her looks (and proves that all hottie TV actresses are destined to play a big screen scream queen at least once in their lives), while Emmanuelle Chriqui just shrieks her way through her part. Standing out a little is Jeremy Sisto, who infuses a bit of humor into an otherwise very disposable role.\n\nThe forest is something of a disappointment, as well. With a potentially excellent setting at his disposal, director Rob Schmidt fails to generate any creepy atmosphere in an environment where you'd think atmosphere would almost come naturally (to be fair, a lot of horror movies also seem to have this problem; the last time I saw a forest setting utilized perfectly was in 2003's terrifically frightening Dead End). \n\nDespite the fact I've done little more than harp on the film, there's no denying that the middle half-hour is occasionally entertaining. There's a semi-suspenseful scene set in a vehicular junkyard (finally, a little variety in setting, huh?) and another effective sequence set inside a watchtower that segues to an exciting chase atop the branches of some very large trees. The murders are too sparse, given the small cast, but they're gruesome and memorable, and thankfully not as relentlessly cruel as the deaths in Cabin Fever, but boast just the right touch of menace and hard-edged violence.\n\nThe three hillbilly killers aren't quite as successful as the gore; in fact, seeing less of them would have been appreciated, considering their grotesque appearance almost crosses into the realm of self-parody. Even The X-Files knew better than that. \n\nAnyway, whatever momentum the middle half-hour built up comes crashing down in the final minutes, with the film actually closing out with an explosion, surely a sign of desperation on the part of the screenwriter if he can't come up with any brighter ideas in a slasher (I was, in fact, about to give the movie a ** 1/2 until the climax).

Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era "Cold Mountain," starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.\n\nThen again, calling Cold Mountain" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts "Glory" director Edward Zwick shame. However, "Cold Mountain" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.\n\n"Cold Mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.\n\nWithin these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern "lawman," and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by "the war of Northern aggression," mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.\n\nDirector Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.\n\nMake no mistake, "Cold Mountain" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":144945,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2004-02-25","keywords":"cold mountain north carolina,u.s. civil war,year 1864,nonlinear timeline,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cold Mountain","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3505298969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ2OTRlZmMtMjk0Ny00ZjdhLWFhZGMtMzU3NGYzNjM5N2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ2OTRlZmMtMjk0Ny00ZjdhLWFhZGMtMzU3NGYzNjM5N2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0292565/","name":"Charles Frazier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"}],"duration":"PT2H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era "Cold Mountain," starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.\n\nThen again, calling Cold Mountain" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts "Glory" director Edward Zwick shame. However, "Cold Mountain" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.\n\n"Cold Mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.\n\nWithin these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern "lawman," and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by "the war of Northern aggression," mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.\n\nDirector Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.\n\nMake no mistake, "Cold Mountain" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":144945,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2004-02-25","keywords":"cold mountain north carolina,u.s. civil war,year 1864,nonlinear timeline,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cold Mountain","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3505298969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ2OTRlZmMtMjk0Ny00ZjdhLWFhZGMtMzU3NGYzNjM5N2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ2OTRlZmMtMjk0Ny00ZjdhLWFhZGMtMzU3NGYzNjM5N2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0292565/","name":"Charles Frazier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"],"duration":"PT2H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nicolas Cage did a great job playing Ghost Rider and of course it's always nice to see Eva Mendes on screen of course. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie is how they decided to put in a villain who turned out to be an easy defeat instead of picking one that would be more of a challenge but then again it's an origin movie so everything has to start off easy i guess.

Kad jedan 14-godišnjak osujeti provalu u kuću, Gibbs posumnja da im taj tinejdžer uskraćuje relevantne detalje. Također, direktor Vance i viši FBI-ev agent Fornell putuju u Londonu u sklopu tekućega slučaja pobjegloga britanskoga špijuna. U ovoj se epizodi pojavljuje prva dama Michelle Obama kad primi Gibbsa i ženu jednoga marinca u Bijelu kuću na okruglom stolu "Udružimo snage" supruga vojnika. "Udružimo snage" nacionalna je inicijativa kojom se sve Amerikance poziva da se okupe oko pripadnika oružanih snaga, veterana i njihovih obitelji te im pruže potporu preko zdravstvenih i obrazovnih mogućnosti te zapošljavanja.</desc>

I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.\n\nAs far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.\n\nWho should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":264002,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-10-19","keywords":"moral dilemma,missing child,surprise ending,private detective,kidnapping","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gone Baby Gone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi610796825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAwMTQ3YTItMzQzOC00OGE0LTk5NzgtYTMyODE0OGQxZTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAwMTQ3YTItMzQzOC00OGE0LTk5NzgtYTMyODE0OGQxZTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #1, post"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000729/","name":"Casey Affleck"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042559/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033633/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0830760/","name":"Aaron Stockard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212331/","name":"Dennis Lehane"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.\n\nAs far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.\n\nWho should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":264002,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-10-19","keywords":"moral dilemma,missing child,surprise ending,private detective,kidnapping","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gone Baby Gone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi610796825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAwMTQ3YTItMzQzOC00OGE0LTk5NzgtYTMyODE0OGQxZTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAwMTQ3YTItMzQzOC00OGE0LTk5NzgtYTMyODE0OGQxZTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #1, post","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000729/","name":"Casey Affleck"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042559/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033633/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0830760/","name":"Aaron Stockard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212331/","name":"Dennis Lehane"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the last word in Law &amp; Order within Mega-City One. Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) is his junior partner. They are battling drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is operating out of a massive apartment block.\n\nThe previous version of Judge Dredd (1995) starring Sly is a campy affair. Consider that it had Rob Schneider in it. 'nuff said. This one brings us into the comics once again but this time, they drop the camp. It is well written probably because they had Alex Garland who also wrote 28 Days Later... and Sunshine among others. Karl Urban is not as imposing as Sly but he does a solid job. Most importantly, he's not impersonating Sly. Olivia Thirlby is great as a foil or conscience to Dredd. Their relationship is the heart of the movie. Lena Headey does a good job as the baddie. It's an interesting unusual choice. It's certainly not your average muscle bound villain.\n\nI did have 2 problems. First, Slo-Mo happens too many times. The first couple of times are interesting.

Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the last word in Law &amp; Order within Mega-City One. Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) is his junior partner. They are battling drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is operating out of a massive apartment block.\n\nThe previous version of Judge Dredd (1995) starring Sly is a campy affair. Consider that it had Rob Schneider in it. 'nuff said. This one brings us into the comics once again but this time, they drop the camp. It is well written probably because they had Alex Garland who also wrote 28 Days Later... and Sunshine among others. Karl Urban is not as imposing as Sly but he does a solid job. Most importantly, he's not impersonating Sly. Olivia Thirlby is great as a foil or conscience to Dredd. Their relationship is the heart of the movie. Lena Headey does a good job as the baddie. It's an interesting unusual choice. It's certainly not your average muscle bound villain.\n\nI did have 2 problems. First, Slo-Mo happens too many times. The first couple of times are interesting. I'm sure it's cool 3D fun, but even that would get tiresome. It's a balancing act between pace and cool and the climax needs pace more than cool. Second problem is the ending. The final fight with Lena Headey is not as climatic as needed. It's a bit of a letdown.

He's helped by a couple with two kids, which share different opinions regarding the new troublemaker which "landed" in their home. Although helping him find a proper home, the Browns start to attach to the newcomer but his negligent way of life and an evil hunter from a local history museum tend to interfere in their relationship, for better or worse.\n\nWe're presented with the amusing and entertaining adventures of this strange bear which comes to a big city in search of a new life, but ends up in a lot of trouble, more or less due to his actions. It's a movie which doesn't have an extraordinary plot, but it's enough to keep you interested while making you laugh with almost everything the cute bear does. By the way, the CGI is top notch, and together with the actors' performance, create a good movie for everybody to enjoy. As downsides, it tends to exaggerate in many scenes, while being very simplistic when speaking about the "evil" part which hunts Paddington.\n\nStill, it manages to create a very enjoyable atmosphere which makes this movie a very good watch, especially during winter holidays.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-11-28","keywords":"bear,paddington station london,talking bear,taxidermist,title spoken by character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi706391833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MjkxMDM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkyNzgzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MjkxMDM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkyNzgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young English boy befriends a talking bear he finds at a London train station.

He's helped by a couple with two kids, which share different opinions regarding the new troublemaker which "landed" in their home. Although helping him find a proper home, the Browns start to attach to the newcomer but his negligent way of life and an evil hunter from a local history museum tend to interfere in their relationship, for better or worse.\n\nWe're presented with the amusing and entertaining adventures of this strange bear which comes to a big city in search of a new life, but ends up in a lot of trouble, more or less due to his actions. It's a movie which doesn't have an extraordinary plot, but it's enough to keep you interested while making you laugh with almost everything the cute bear does. By the way, the CGI is top notch, and together with the actors' performance, create a good movie for everybody to enjoy. As downsides, it tends to exaggerate in many scenes, while being very simplistic when speaking about the "evil" part which hunts Paddington.\n\nStill, it manages to create a very enjoyable atmosphere which makes this movie a very good watch, especially during winter holidays.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-11-28","keywords":"bear,paddington station london,talking bear,taxidermist,title spoken by character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi706391833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MjkxMDM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkyNzgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MjkxMDM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkyNzgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young English boy befriends a talking bear he finds at a London train station.

A very surprising one at that. It's talky, moving at a slowburn pace, which is a blessing, especially in this genre, open to showing human characters function in a strange world, and deep in its focus on two characters that do more than meet-cute - they stay cute. They also make it easy to like them since they're sincere and just as confused as we were as they quickly wander out of adolescence before they even felt like they were in.\n\nThe film opens with Dave (Dylan O'Brien), a senior in high school, rehearsing lines in a back alley during a party that he plans to recite to Jane (Nickelodeon's Victoria Justice), a close friend he has big feelings for. He is overheard by Aubrey (Britt Robertson), a Junior in high school, who's friends are the party in the house next door. They have a nice, intimate discussion about relationships and crushes, and Aubrey even gives him some rather harsh constructive criticism on his letter, which she says is rambling and petty and isn't likely to sway her feelings at all. Despite this, Dave continues talking with her and they dance preciously in the alley until the party is raided by police.\n\nThey then decide to go to Aubrey's home, where they listen to vinyl, drink wine, and sleep together on the bed innocently enough, despite Aubrey making clear that she has a boyfriend. The next morning, Aubrey, in a freaked-out state-of-mind, forces Dave out the window, reminding herself not only that she has a boyfriend but pretty strict parents as well. This sets up a tone for the weekend.\n\nWhat follows is Dave's attempts to connect with Aubrey, avoid her preachy and overly-clingy boyfriend Ronny (James Frecheville), and receive advice from his pals Simon (Craig Roberts) and "Big Corporation" (LaMarcus Tinker), all in the span of one weekend. It isn't hard to figure out where this will lead, as the title pretty much blatantly gives it away. This will be the first time both Dave and Aubrey have sex, which they discover isn't as exciting or as easy as they thought; one of the most charming additions to The First Time. The film never leaves the ground of reality, and even during the scenes of the party, never do we feel that director Jon Kasdan is attempting to perpetuate raunchiness between characters or force situations onto them. The dialog (also by Kasdan) remains controlled, yet so alert that you would think it's done in a form of improvisation.\n\nThe leads are especially likable, as well, giving the film an elevation in the character-department, which is what many teen comedy-dramas struggle to create. While these characters may be a bit too eclectic and distinctly-drawn for some audience members to connect with, they are nonetheless interesting and made likable by their innocent, judgments, and their chemistry. Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson do wonderful work as teens caught up in the mixed-signals and adolescent nature of relationships, crushes, and insecurities. Victoria Justice is a pleasant addition to the cast, but those looking for her as a character worth putting on the poster will be disappointed; she is allotted, maybe, ten minutes of the whole project. But in those ten minutes, she says a few things that give you the indication why this project wasn't backed by Nickelodeon. Regardless, I laud her for trying new territory; sign her up for a Harmony Korine project next.\n\nThere are different levels of teen films in 2013. They can excel to nearly unobtainable levels of masterworks like The Breakfast Club or The Perks of Being a Wallflower, steady their sights on competence and energy and be something like Drumline or Little Birds, or could go in the dumpster along with Girl in Progress and the wretched Project X. The First Time may be, at times, predictable, fluffy, and too eclectic for its own good, but it gets by on charm, character-charisma, and slick writing. Unfortunately, it's something that will unfortunately go predominately unseen by teenagers.\n\nStarring: Dylan O'Brien, Britt Robertson, Craig Roberts, Joshua Malina, James Frecheville, Christine Taylor, and Victoria Justice.

But this filmmaker has other plans. And what intriguing and complicated plans they are. The story is really interesting and it does keep it real. With all the ugly faces it brings up. I am not sure about the evil character being "humanized", but I get what she is trying to say there too.\n\nThere are so many things, details in this well researched and well crafted movie, that I don't think everything will be seen the first time around. What you do have to go through (and I don't think this will get better with repeat viewing) are some very nasty and vile scenes happening to some of the characters you should care for. So this is anything but an easy film to watch. It is harrowing and it is draining. But in a sense it may also be "rewarding", if you consider the things it touches and brings forth ... every nation, every land, every country has their own fair share of dark history they probably don't like to be reminded of.\n\nSo tread lightly, be aware of the slow pace, but still brutal story(telling) ... and go on a dark journey ...

But this filmmaker has other plans. And what intriguing and complicated plans they are. The story is really interesting and it does keep it real. With all the ugly faces it brings up. I am not sure about the evil character being "humanized", but I get what she is trying to say there too.\n\nThere are so many things, details in this well researched and well crafted movie, that I don't think everything will be seen the first time around. What you do have to go through (and I don't think this will get better with repeat viewing) are some very nasty and vile scenes happening to some of the characters you should care for. So this is anything but an easy film to watch. It is harrowing and it is draining. But in a sense it may also be "rewarding", if you consider the things it touches and brings forth ... every nation, every land, every country has their own fair share of dark history they probably don't like to be reminded of.\n\nSo tread lightly, be aware of the slow pace, but still brutal story(telling) ... and go on a dark journey ... Really dark!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26414,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-29","keywords":"rape,19th century,murder,revenge,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4241931289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman in 1800's Australia seeks vengeance for horrific acts committed against her family.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4957233/","name":"Aisling Franciosi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11583458/","name":"Maya Christie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8849491/","name":"Baykali Ganambarr"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0375200/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0634932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Good God, the film is gorgeous to look at. We've seen hints of a similar visual style in the "Total Recall" remake and "Inception," but the filmmakers milk the unique look in "Upside Down" in as many frames as possible. At times, the visual puns can be a bit too obnoxious to the point it becomes stupid, but overall, they portray the "dual gravity" idea really creatively. Of course, with fantasy films like this that operate within its own set of rules, you usually have to ignore the implausibilities and just go along for the ride.\n\nHowever, the story is a whole different matter. As the film opens to explain the world's rules through voice over rather than showing it on screen, I knew I was in for trouble. Within the first five minutes, exposition after exposition is thrown to the audience at such a quick pace it's almost impossible to keep up. It also doesn't help that the dialogue is downright embarrassing. With the film's over-reliance on narration, "Upside Down" leaves little time for its characters to develop which consequently makes the story as a whole feel contrived.\n\nFor example, the love interest that grows between the film's two main characters comes out of nowhere. Unfortunately, actors Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst don't have the chemistry to sell their newfound romance authentically as well. Every story development feels fake and mechanical where it should feel natural. Furthermore, the film lacks any real climax, so the last 20 minutes where everything should build up to a resounding resolution, instead, just fizzles out to an anti-climatic, deus-ex-machina-like ending as if the story didn't know how else to end.\n\n"Upside Down" has a great idea that should have been a lot better than it ended up being. However, it's obvious the filmmakers were more interested in focusing on the visuals than actually telling a good story. "Upside Down" proves that as awesome as visuals can be, it can't overshadow incompetent storytelling and a weak plot.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70948,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-05-01","keywords":"gravity,childhood,amnesia,3 dimensional,duplicate earth","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi219391769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NDUyOTI0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA3NjEwOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NDUyOTI0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA3NjEwOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Adam and Eden fell in love as teens despite the fact that they live on twinned worlds with gravities that pull in opposite directions.

Jonathan Swift  Walking into the cinema... Intrigueing is the word that comes to mind  with The Age of Adaline. It is hard to categorise this film. Is it  fantasy, a romance, a philosophical exercise, or a combination of them  all?   Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Big Questions value:  4 stars  What would you do if you were to remain 29 years of age for the rest of  your life? Some might think that this would be ideal, while others  would consider this to be a horrifying experience. This is the life of  Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively). Through a series of fantastic phenomena,  she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades. She has to  experience a life of solitude and separation, because she cannot age  with those that she is closest to in her life. Her life is veiled in  secrecy, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a  philanthropist who ignites her passion for life and unknowingly he is a  link to her past. What seems to be an innocent weekend away, becomes a  crossroads for the truth and a chance for her to decide what she will  do with the rest of her life.   I will admit it, a good romance is a joy to experience. Romances may  not be my favourite genre, but they have their place in cinematic  history. The Age of Adeline will not win awards for groundbreaking film  making, but it does fill a void in this year's celluloid offerings. It  is a good, straight forward, romantic journey. Even with the fantasy  element of eternal youth, this was a good film for the romantic at  heart. It can get a bit sappy, but it is a satisfying tale. Indie  director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste and Jesse Forever) is able to  incorporate a level of geekiness to satisfy any male audience members  without sacrificing the primary storyline. His measured style develops  a believability of this inventive story. Kreiger hearkens back to the  beautiful romances of bygone eras, where subtlety and magnificent  cinematography aid in delivering a beautiful romance. With the same  level of measured performance, Blake Lively is excellent as the lead.  She portrays the melancholy of a woman who lives with the mind of an  elderly woman trapped in a perpetually young body. She allows herself  to fall for Ellis, who is an old soul in a young man's body. Huisman  brings a depth of character that makes this relationship right for both  of them. One of the challenges of decade jumping films is the ageing of  key characters, but Kreiger manages to make this element convincing.  From the excellent supporting performances from Harrison Ford and Ellen  Burstyn to the young actors that portrayed them in earlier decades,  these characters were convincing and do not cause any distraction.  Admittedly, the unfortunate component of watching this genre is the  anticipation of sappiness or the inevitable tragedy. The Age of Adaline  is a romance and contains some of these inevitable trappings, but due  to the melancholy of the lead character and the control she has to  shoulder for eight decades, this tale contains the bitter sweetness  needed to move beyond the syrupy elements of many good hearted  romances. Which leaves the verdict that Kreiger delivers an appealing  and enjoyable romance.   Before the opening sequence, this romantic adventure provides some of  the best discussion points in recent cinema. In our era of desired  eternal youth or the desire to merely appearing young, The Age of  Adaline allows the audience to see the curse that this gift can be on  anyone's life. It helps that Blake Lively is an attractive woman and  manages to not experience any disfiguring accidents in her one-hundred  and seven years. Which could cause a level of disbelief in the story,  but does not become a consideration. Her pain seems to come from being  attractive to most men, but she cannot allow herself to respond to  their advances and she is only is allowed to be close with her dog,  Reggie. Thoughts move from eternal youth to eternal life. Her  melancholic spirit is shown in her awareness of this life that she  remains trapped in. There has to be more as death occurs all around  her, but she seems to be eternally trapped. She maintains a mental  strength to not seek death as the answer to her pain, but death does  add to the shadow that envelops her life. If that is not enough,  Adaline has to lie and say farewell to all who come into her life. Her  life is a moral conundrum and explains why she seems to be a shell of a  woman throughout much of the film, until she is eventually allowed to  tell the truth and live the life she never thought she could live. The  Age of Adaline proves to be more than a romance. It is a philosophical  journey packaged as this year's romance.   Leaving the cinema: Is it ironic that a film of ageless beauty would be  packaged in the film making style of yesteryear? This felt like a  romance from the past, but will meet modern audiences with a fresh view  on romance. This is a film that can bring out the romantic in anyone.  It may have a sappy element, but it is satisfying and may make the date  night dinner conversation deeper and more meaningful.  Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this  film? 1. Would you want to be forever young? (Ecclesiastes 12:1, 2  Timothy 2:22) 2.

The personalities of key people are wrong, some characters just made up, rather sloppily too. \n\nSo we can forgive it for being a wholly inaccurate of Sid Vicious' life. Fine, but so then what we are left with is a basic love story. It fails at this too, mostly because Nancy is written out pure spite and misogyny. She is therefore not only unlikable but wholly uninteresting. \n\nYou never believe the love story, because quite frankly Nancy isn't really written as a human being, just a series of tropes about junkies and that awful idea that women are shrews that stifle men's creativity.\n\nThe truth is Nancy was much more physically beautiful than this film wishes to admit. She was also quite charming, in fact, if you know junkie culture, you know that charm, deadly psychotic charm is a key way to survive and support your habit. None of that is shown here, so that ability for junkies to convince others they are clean, or kind or honest is obliterated. \n\nNancy was smarter than this film gives credit for (yes even though she was a junkie), with more charisma too and if they had written her that way it would make for a better film. \n\nThe real Sid fell in love with a real human being, a flawed one to be sure, but the kind of junkie a lot of us could fall for. In this film she's just a very nasty series of dull, obvious tropes. \n\nJust about everyone intimately involved with the Sex Pistols has disowned this film. \n\nI think there are moments of visual poetry in this film, I think Gary Oldman's performance is excellent, but the script is a Hollywood hackneyed attempt to reduce the Sex Pistols to every stereotype and narrow prejudice those who were never punks have always harbored about the punk movement. \n\nIt's sad because there is some real craft to this film, it had tremendous potential, but ultimately you can just never believe Sid would fall for this less-than-human harpy.

Jonathan Swift  Walking into the cinema... Intrigueing is the word that comes to mind  with The Age of Adaline. It is hard to categorise this film. Is it  fantasy, a romance, a philosophical exercise, or a combination of them  all?   Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Big Questions value:  4 stars  What would you do if you were to remain 29 years of age for the rest of  your life? Some might think that this would be ideal, while others  would consider this to be a horrifying experience. This is the life of  Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively). Through a series of fantastic phenomena,  she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades. She has to  experience a life of solitude and separation, because she cannot age  with those that she is closest to in her life. Her life is veiled in  secrecy, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a  philanthropist who ignites her passion for life and unknowingly he is a  link to her past. What seems to be an innocent weekend away, becomes a  crossroads for the truth and a chance for her to decide what she will  do with the rest of her life.   I will admit it, a good romance is a joy to experience. Romances may  not be my favourite genre, but they have their place in cinematic  history. The Age of Adeline will not win awards for groundbreaking film  making, but it does fill a void in this year's celluloid offerings. It  is a good, straight forward, romantic journey. Even with the fantasy  element of eternal youth, this was a good film for the romantic at  heart. It can get a bit sappy, but it is a satisfying tale. Indie  director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste and Jesse Forever) is able to  incorporate a level of geekiness to satisfy any male audience members  without sacrificing the primary storyline. His measured style develops  a believability of this inventive story. Kreiger hearkens back to the  beautiful romances of bygone eras, where subtlety and magnificent  cinematography aid in delivering a beautiful romance. With the same  level of measured performance, Blake Lively is excellent as the lead.  She portrays the melancholy of a woman who lives with the mind of an  elderly woman trapped in a perpetually young body. She allows herself  to fall for Ellis, who is an old soul in a young man's body. Huisman  brings a depth of character that makes this relationship right for both  of them. One of the challenges of decade jumping films is the ageing of  key characters, but Kreiger manages to make this element convincing.  From the excellent supporting performances from Harrison Ford and Ellen  Burstyn to the young actors that portrayed them in earlier decades,  these characters were convincing and do not cause any distraction.  Admittedly, the unfortunate component of watching this genre is the  anticipation of sappiness or the inevitable tragedy. The Age of Adaline  is a romance and contains some of these inevitable trappings, but due  to the melancholy of the lead character and the control she has to  shoulder for eight decades, this tale contains the bitter sweetness  needed to move beyond the syrupy elements of many good hearted  romances. Which leaves the verdict that Kreiger delivers an appealing  and enjoyable romance.   Before the opening sequence, this romantic adventure provides some of  the best discussion points in recent cinema. In our era of desired  eternal youth or the desire to merely appearing young, The Age of  Adaline allows the audience to see the curse that this gift can be on  anyone's life. It helps that Blake Lively is an attractive woman and  manages to not experience any disfiguring accidents in her one-hundred  and seven years. Which could cause a level of disbelief in the story,  but does not become a consideration. Her pain seems to come from being  attractive to most men, but she cannot allow herself to respond to  their advances and she is only is allowed to be close with her dog,  Reggie. Thoughts move from eternal youth to eternal life. Her  melancholic spirit is shown in her awareness of this life that she  remains trapped in. There has to be more as death occurs all around  her, but she seems to be eternally trapped. She maintains a mental  strength to not seek death as the answer to her pain, but death does  add to the shadow that envelops her life. If that is not enough,  Adaline has to lie and say farewell to all who come into her life. Her  life is a moral conundrum and explains why she seems to be a shell of a  woman throughout much of the film, until she is eventually allowed to  tell the truth and live the life she never thought she could live. The  Age of Adaline proves to be more than a romance. It is a philosophical  journey packaged as this year's romance.   Leaving the cinema: Is it ironic that a film of ageless beauty would be  packaged in the film making style of yesteryear? This felt like a  romance from the past, but will meet modern audiences with a fresh view  on romance. This is a film that can bring out the romantic in anyone.  It may have a sappy element, but it is satisfying and may make the date  night dinner conversation deeper and more meaningful.

Is it  fantasy, a romance, a philosophical exercise, or a combination of them  all?   Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Big Questions value:  4 stars  What would you do if you were to remain 29 years of age for the rest of  your life? Some might think that this would be ideal, while others  would consider this to be a horrifying experience. This is the life of  Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively). Through a series of fantastic phenomena,  she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades. She has to  experience a life of solitude and separation, because she cannot age  with those that she is closest to in her life. Her life is veiled in  secrecy, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a  philanthropist who ignites her passion for life and unknowingly he is a  link to her past.

It's a flawless, burnished production, a virtually perfect film. This glowing, suspenseful docudrama retells the story of the days of upheaval in London and elsewhere, in 1997, shortly after Tony Blair had just won for Labor, by steering clear of trades unions and welfare statism, while flogging his "let's modernize Britain" program, window-dressing for his Clinton-like political shift to the right.\n\nThen, on August 31, Princess Diana, recently divorced from Prince Charles, was killed in a high speed auto accident in midtown Paris. The film's story turns on how various echelons of British society reacted following Diana's death. Dramatized are many vignettes that bring together the major personalities at the center of the highly public dilemma that unfolded in the few days following Diana's passing.\n\nHelen Mirren was, as they say, born to play Queen Elizabeth II. In every tableau, in every body movement, in every nuanced shift in feeling she conveys to us, with or without words, she is simply majestic. But this movie is far more than a showcase, a star vehicle, for Ms. Mirren. Each of the major supporting players, portraying some prominent person, is superb. Besides The Queen, we have The Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms), Prince Philip (James Cromwell), Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), Mr. Blair (Michael Sheen), and their respective retainers, playing out at close range their responses to one another, within the framework of a taut cultural and political crisis, one that is, above all else, a threat to public support of the Monarchy.\n\nThis drama takes place in an enervating, though also suppressed, emotional atmosphere, the tension level constantly ratcheted up by the principals' responses to pressures from the public and the press. (Of course the accuracy of the depictions is open to some question at least, and, in addition, there is the insurmountable problem that no one knows for sure the full truth about many of the rumored conversations -discussions that might or might not have transpired among these people - that are dramatized here. It is fair to say that the actors have magnificently sculpted their characterizations to fit the common perceptions of these celebrities in the public eye.\n\nBut there's more: I haven't yet touched on the main reason that I think this movie will be considered a classic decades from now. That is it's overarching subtext, not about individual personalities, but about a deep change in the very fabric of social custom signaled by events after Diana's death, especially in Britain, but also in the U. S. and other "anglophilic" "developed" nations. The point is made crystal clear in the film: Elizabeth's seemingly callous aloofness from the public in the wake of Diana's death is the result of her conviction, based on her upbringing, that duty must come first, that stoicism is the face one shows the world, while personal feelings are an entirely private matter, hence not to be aired in public. One must soldier on. Stiff upper lip. The English way.\n\nAccording to this film narrative, Queen Elizabeth makes a serious miscalculation when she fails to consider, or perhaps even to perceive, the fact that the terms of public discourse - perhaps especially with regard to the open expression of personal sentiments - have changed radically around the world.

It's a flawless, burnished production, a virtually perfect film. This glowing, suspenseful docudrama retells the story of the days of upheaval in London and elsewhere, in 1997, shortly after Tony Blair had just won for Labor, by steering clear of trades unions and welfare statism, while flogging his "let's modernize Britain" program, window-dressing for his Clinton-like political shift to the right.\n\nThen, on August 31, Princess Diana, recently divorced from Prince Charles, was killed in a high speed auto accident in midtown Paris. The film's story turns on how various echelons of British society reacted following Diana's death. Dramatized are many vignettes that bring together the major personalities at the center of the highly public dilemma that unfolded in the few days following Diana's passing.\n\nHelen Mirren was, as they say, born to play Queen Elizabeth II. In every tableau, in every body movement, in every nuanced shift in feeling she conveys to us, with or without words, she is simply majestic. But this movie is far more than a showcase, a star vehicle, for Ms. Mirren. Each of the major supporting players, portraying some prominent person, is superb. Besides The Queen, we have The Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms), Prince Philip (James Cromwell), Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), Mr. Blair (Michael Sheen), and their respective retainers, playing out at close range their responses to one another, within the framework of a taut cultural and political crisis, one that is, above all else, a threat to public support of the Monarchy.\n\nThis drama takes place in an enervating, though also suppressed, emotional atmosphere, the tension level constantly ratcheted up by the principals' responses to pressures from the public and the press. (Of course the accuracy of the depictions is open to some question at least, and, in addition, there is the insurmountable problem that no one knows for sure the full truth about many of the rumored conversations -discussions that might or might not have transpired among these people - that are dramatized here. It is fair to say that the actors have magnificently sculpted their characterizations to fit the common perceptions of these celebrities in the public eye.\n\nBut there's more: I haven't yet touched on the main reason that I think this movie will be considered a classic decades from now. That is it's overarching subtext, not about individual personalities, but about a deep change in the very fabric of social custom signaled by events after Diana's death, especially in Britain, but also in the U. S. and other "anglophilic" "developed" nations. The point is made crystal clear in the film: Elizabeth's seemingly callous aloofness from the public in the wake of Diana's death is the result of her conviction, based on her upbringing, that duty must come first, that stoicism is the face one shows the world, while personal feelings are an entirely private matter, hence not to be aired in public. One must soldier on. Stiff upper lip. The English way.\n\nAccording to this film narrative, Queen Elizabeth makes a serious miscalculation when she fails to consider, or perhaps even to perceive, the fact that the terms of public discourse - perhaps especially with regard to the open expression of personal sentiments - have changed radically around the world. Frank disclosure of personal feelings and issues once considered taboo for public consumption, emotional "witnessing," and even mass catharsis, have for many become the norm, displacing public stoicism, in response to poignant events. We know this from many lines of evidence, of course: confessional literature and film; the outpourings of personal tragedy and conflict on "Oprah" and a host of clone television and radio shows, and so on. But the Royals' cloistered existence very probably has always shielded them from accurately gauging the pulse of popular societal changes.\n\nNever in recent times had there been such a worldwide wave of acute public grief over the loss of a single person, perhaps not since John Kennedy's death, as was the case of Diana, whom so many admired, revered, indeed, loved, even if from afar. The Queen documents with brilliance and power this major sea change in societal conventions, a shift that historians will undoubtedly look back upon as one of the most important and influential quakes in the tectonic annals of civil conduct.

From humble beginnings to the height of success, the documentary delivers a captivating recount of Lee Alexander McQueens foray into fashion. For anyone who goes to see McQueen, they will be thankful that we lived in a time where history can be recorded for review. The documentary uncovers insider footage from the early days at St Martin's design school through to his final showing.

Albert Finney gives a heartfelt performance as an old, crusty, teacher, who reflects on his career and life in the days leading to his retirement. He comes to the realization that his entire life's work has been, for the most part, in vain.  It is reminiscent of Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Illyich. While in Tolstoy's Illyich, the character reflects on his life while on his death bed, Finney's soul searching is triggered by his imminent retirement.

While in Tolstoy's Illyich, the character reflects on his life while on his death bed, Finney's soul searching is triggered by his imminent retirement.

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

After the superb images in Gravity or Interstellar, I was curious to see what 2019 brings. I wasn't disappointed, the movie is very well shot, the Space images are well made, deep sky, the Planets, the Moon, really nice.\n\nHowever, I think the movie was ruined by its screenplay which lacks of coherence. The story is really weak and undeveloped. There are many fractures in the reality of space travelling,\n\nYou almost have the feeling that the screenplay was written to have a support for the images, nothing more.\n\nSo yeah, I give this movie a 6 and I'm sad to see how a possible epic movie is ruined by a weak screenplay.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":217345,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"astronaut,outer space,father son relationship,moon,missing father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ad Astra","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836788505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550948/","name":"Ruth Negga"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342473/","name":"Ethan Gross"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In this period of time, I learned that the Latvians had been infringed and butchered by neighboring countries such as Germany and Russia. To gain freedom, even children had to fight with rifles in their hands and their innocent blood was spilt. Although the overall style of this film is rather subdued, it conveys the pain and the horror the boy experiences very intensely. Even the battle scenes aren't overly dramatic which makes the film more realistic.

In this period of time, I learned that the Latvians had been infringed and butchered by neighboring countries such as Germany and Russia. To gain freedom, even children had to fight with rifles in their hands and their innocent blood was spilt. Although the overall style of this film is rather subdued, it conveys the pain and the horror the boy experiences very intensely. Even the battle scenes aren't overly dramatic which makes the film more realistic. Very sad yet a powerful story to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3673,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2019-11-08","keywords":"world war one,male nudity,male rear nudity,skinny dipping,murder","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi930790937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzIzZjRlYzctYjgyNy00NWQ5LWE1ZjUtODI5ZGVhMzM2ZWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzIzZjRlYzctYjgyNy00NWQ5LWE1ZjUtODI5ZGVhMzM2ZWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9415555/","name":"Oto Brantevics","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11130883/","name":"Greta Trusina","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898462/","name":"Martins Vilsons"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4437136/","name":"Dzintars Dreibergs"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296685/","name":"Boris Frumin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8457574/","name":"Aleksandrs Grins"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence.

The main characters are interesting and well-acted, although if you are a steady mystery viewer, you will figure out the ending very soon, which does take away from the suspense.\n\nSean Evans presents the shy, taciturn Morse in his younger days as a detective. He is fetching and keeps his own counsel as to personal matters, and we can see him developing into the ascerbic, driven chief detective we've come to love and respect. Colin Dexter's brill writing launches us here in ENDEAVOR into a seamless transformation into the mature Morse with promise of excellent episodes to come. I'd like to see more of the young Morse and hope this is only one segment of what will surely be a superior backstory for the series. Beautifully written and paced, ENDEAVOR presents a cast of appealing faces and splendidly low key criminal pursuits. Highly recommended. I loved it, am clamoring for more.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22558,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It maintains everything that makes Inspector Morse so good, while also containing enough to make it its own.\n\nEndeavour looks great, the series throughout is exquisitely photographed and there is something very nostalgic and charming about the atmospherically evoked 1960s period detail. It was also a genius move to keep Barrington Pheloung on board, with his hauntingly beautiful scoring and immortal Inspector Morse theme, while the classical music and operatic excerpts are delightful to hear and fit perfectly (a notable example would be in the Fugue episode, the music having a beautiful and frightfully ominous effect).\n\nThe series is also every bit as intelligently written as Inspector Morse, it's every bit as entertaining and also every bit as tense. Not all the story lines are very original, but they are always incredibly gripping with the mysteries not being too complicated or the identities being too improbable or obvious, Morse and Thursday's father/son relationship has a lot of warmth, is so well written within the stories and is a large part of the series' appeal and there is some good suspense (chilling in fact in the case of Fugue). Pacing is restrained, but that allows the atmosphere to come through, and pretty much all the same it excels in that aspect. The characters are interesting, and are evolving more and more with every episode, Morse's familiar characteristics are becoming more obvious as the writing develops and Morse and Thursday's relationship more entertaining and heartfelt.\n\nShaun Evans does some powerful, charismatic work as younger Morse, and is getting more and more confident with every episode, showing enough loyalty to John Thaw's iconic Morse while making the character his own too. Roger Allam is also superb, his rapport with Evans always compels and entertains but Thursday is quite a sympathetic character, as well as loyal and firm, and Allam does a lot special with a role that could have been less interesting possibly in lesser hands. All the acting is very good, as is the controlled direction, but it's the performances of Evans and Allam that will always be remembered most vividly.\n\nAll in all, a more than worthy (if not quite as good, only because I love Inspector Morse with a passion) prequel series and also a great series on its own that keeps getting stronger. 9/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22333,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The fabulous 1971 version featuring the marvellous Richard Attenborough will live on as a classic forever. So once again, well done BBC for retelling a story in such a thorough and compelling way.\n\nThe three hour format worked well, it allowed the story to develop naturally, at no point did it feel rushed, each character was given time to deliver.\n\nTim Roth was sensational in the role of Christie, softly spoken, calm, yet monstrous and conniving, I believed utterly in the character he portrayed. He certainly looked the part also. It feels unkind to say that Samantha Morton is a safe pair of hands, but that she is, an actress of immense talent, who always seems to deliver the goods, a super performance as Mrs Christie.\n\nThis drama made me curious about the case, and I've picked up a book for some further reading.\n\nIf I was brutally honest, I'd say Part 1 was a little too slow, and felt like it had been padded out, twenty minutes into the second part though it takes a very sinister turn, and transforms into something nasty, but enthralling.\n\nHarsh, unnerving, but very impressive. 9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-11-29","keywords":"1940s,serial killer,tv mini series,based on true story,1950s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2813963/","name":"Nico Mirallegro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0608090/","name":"Samantha Morton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0527221/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0592426/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4034509081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYTZjZWQtNjVlOS00N2Q1LWE5YTMtYjViNmNmMmNjMDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYTZjZWQtNjVlOS00N2Q1LWE5YTMtYjViNmNmMmNjMDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A three-part scripted drama based on the real-life multiple murders carried out by John Christie (Roth) in Notting Hill in the 1940s and 50s."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence. Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show. I do hope that there are quite a few new series planned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like Law and Order the show puts more focus on the cases themselves rather than the personal lives of the characters, but The Closer opens the door a little more.

The main characters are interesting and well-acted, although if you are a steady mystery viewer, you will figure out the ending very soon, which does take away from the suspense.\n\nSean Evans presents the shy, taciturn Morse in his younger days as a detective. He is fetching and keeps his own counsel as to personal matters, and we can see him developing into the ascerbic, driven chief detective we've come to love and respect. Colin Dexter's brill writing launches us here in ENDEAVOR into a seamless transformation into the mature Morse with promise of excellent episodes to come. I'd like to see more of the young Morse and hope this is only one segment of what will surely be a superior backstory for the series. Beautifully written and paced, ENDEAVOR presents a cast of appealing faces and splendidly low key criminal pursuits. Highly recommended. I loved it, am clamoring for more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22558,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The main characters are interesting and well-acted, although if you are a steady mystery viewer, you will figure out the ending very soon, which does take away from the suspense.\n\nSean Evans presents the shy, taciturn Morse in his younger days as a detective. He is fetching and keeps his own counsel as to personal matters, and we can see him developing into the ascerbic, driven chief detective we've come to love and respect. Colin Dexter's brill writing launches us here in ENDEAVOR into a seamless transformation into the mature Morse with promise of excellent episodes to come. I'd like to see more of the young Morse and hope this is only one segment of what will surely be a superior backstory for the series. Beautifully written and paced, ENDEAVOR presents a cast of appealing faces and splendidly low key criminal pursuits. Highly recommended. I loved it, am clamoring for more.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22558,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Godina je 1953. Sidney Chambers (James Norton) je vikar u Grantchesteru, selu nedaleko od Cambridgea. Sidney vodi miran život, ili ga je barem vodio - sve dok nije naišao na ubojstvo. Godina je 1953. Sidney Chambers (James Norton) je vikar u Grantchesteru, selu nedaleko od Cambridgea. Sidney vodi miran život, ili ga je barem vodio - sve dok nije naišao na ubojstvo... Zatekavši se u opasnom svijetu laži, izdaje i umorstva, Sidney ubrzo shvaća da mu poznavanje ljudske psihe te povjerenje koje ljudima ulijeva omogućavaju da iznimno vješto obavlja svoj novi ''detektivski'' posao. Sidneyju se u toj mračnoj strani svijeta pridružuju ljubazan, ali od života umoran inspektor Geordie Keating (Robson Green), naivni i dobrohotni kapelan Leonard Finch (Al Weaver) te njegova stroga i vječno nezadovoljna domaćica gđa Maguire (Tessa Peake-Jones). Međutim, kriminal nije jedino što Sidneyju zadaje brige. Sidney je zanesen lijepom i pametnom Amandom (Morven Christie), ali izgubio je svaku nadu da će ikada osvojiti njezino srce onoga trenutka kada je postao svećenikom. Možete li i dalje vidjeti samo najbolje u ljudima kada svijet umorstava od čovjeka traži da u njima vidi samo najgore?</desc>

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. \n\nI did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.\n\nIn the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior. As the story continues those two have slowly become my favorite and I just want to give them a hug, they deserve something good to find it's way to them.\n\nThis way of telling the story is central and easy as it grabs hold of once affection for those characters that live in this town and they grow on you. The town has this (Gilmore Girls) Stars Hollow feel to it with all its fun and strange traditions that without a doubt gives the show part of the charm\n\nThe acting varies very much depending on the actor but again it does not stands out as much as one might think. The stories are often very sweet and reveal the personalized twist of life.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. \n\nI did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.\n\nIn the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior. As the story continues those two have slowly become my favorite and I just want to give them a hug, they deserve something good to find it's way to them.\n\nThis way of telling the story is central and easy as it grabs hold of once affection for those characters that live in this town and they grow on you. The town has this (Gilmore Girls) Stars Hollow feel to it with all its fun and strange traditions that without a doubt gives the show part of the charm\n\nThe acting varies very much depending on the actor but again it does not stands out as much as one might think. The stories are often very sweet and reveal the personalized twist of life.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. \n\nI did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.\n\nIn the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior. As the story continues those two have slowly become my favorite and I just want to give them a hug, they deserve something good to find it's way to them.\n\nThis way of telling the story is central and easy as it grabs hold of once affection for those characters that live in this town and they grow on you. The town has this (Gilmore Girls) Stars Hollow feel to it with all its fun and strange traditions that without a doubt gives the show part of the charm\n\nThe acting varies very much depending on the actor but again it does not stands out as much as one might think. The stories are often very sweet and reveal the personalized twist of life.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. \n\nI did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.\n\nIn the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior. As the story continues those two have slowly become my favorite and I just want to give them a hug, they deserve something good to find it's way to them.\n\nThis way of telling the story is central and easy as it grabs hold of once affection for those characters that live in this town and they grow on you. The town has this (Gilmore Girls) Stars Hollow feel to it with all its fun and strange traditions that without a doubt gives the show part of the charm\n\nThe acting varies very much depending on the actor but again it does not stands out as much as one might think. The stories are often very sweet and reveal the personalized twist of life.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I liked the first Transformers despite it's cheesy dialog in some parts and while there were some awkward moments and very bad dialog, I still liked Revenge of the Fallen. Then, when I saw the whole thing in theaters back at 2011, I thought, this wasn't so bad after all. It later turned out to be a good ride, but while I do think it's a bit of an improvement over the previous film, it's nowhere near as good as the first.\n\nFirst, there are some good things that saved the film for me. The music score from Steve Jablonsky has improved and has an epic tone to it. The story is a lot more decent than the previous film with a much better second and third halves; the action sequences are solid especially the collapsing building scene which took my very breath away. The scenery is great and the special effects are as top-notch as ever. The acting is good, too. While John Turturo, Franches McDormand, and John Malkovich aren't given much to do, they did fine with the material. Patrick Dempsey did OK as the villain, but he's a bit underwhelming. Rosie Hunter Whiteley is a bit bland, but not exactly terrible as the new girlfriend for Sam Witwicky. While Shia LeBeouf isn't as charismatic as he was in the first film, he does have the same charm he brought to the film series so far. The Autobots and Decepticons are great to see again and the voice actors are solid especially Leonard Nimoy as Sentinal Prime, who is a very good villain for the movie much Megatron.\n\nThen, there are the bad things that I would point out. First, the script. While the second and third halves are a lot better, the first half is pretty boring. It seems to be lacking in it's action and it wasn't exciting. Second, the ending is way too similar to the first Transformers (what? with the auto-bots and decepticons fight against each other while bringing destruction to the city and such?) The pacing is also very sluggish it would almost put you to sleep. Third and mostly the final problem is the dialog. There are some humorous bits that might get the audience a chuckle, but there are other parts that are just so inane it would give you a headache.\n\nOverall, Transformers: DOTM isn't nearly as good as the first, but despite the flaws that I just stated, I think this is a great sequel in an overall solid franchise. I may not be a fan of Michael Bay and such, but while I do not like the Bad Boys films, Pearl Harbor, and others, I think that this and the other films are a lot better and it deserves a recommendation to those who haven't seen it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-29","keywords":"job interview,year 1969,optimus prime character,robert f. kennedy character,megatron character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi543989017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTgwOTExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ0NzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTgwOTExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ0NzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Autobots learn of a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden on the Moon, and race against the Decepticons to reach it and learn its secrets, which could turn the tide in the Transformers' final battle."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2492819/","name":"Rosie Huntington-Whiteley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040938/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130376/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472567/","name":"Ehren Kruger"}],"duration":"PT2H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I liked the first Transformers despite it's cheesy dialog in some parts and while there were some awkward moments and very bad dialog, I still liked Revenge of the Fallen. Then, when I saw the whole thing in theaters back at 2011, I thought, this wasn't so bad after all. It later turned out to be a good ride, but while I do think it's a bit of an improvement over the previous film, it's nowhere near as good as the first.\n\nFirst, there are some good things that saved the film for me. The music score from Steve Jablonsky has improved and has an epic tone to it. The story is a lot more decent than the previous film with a much better second and third halves; the action sequences are solid especially the collapsing building scene which took my very breath away. The scenery is great and the special effects are as top-notch as ever. The acting is good, too. While John Turturo, Franches McDormand, and John Malkovich aren't given much to do, they did fine with the material. Patrick Dempsey did OK as the villain, but he's a bit underwhelming. Rosie Hunter Whiteley is a bit bland, but not exactly terrible as the new girlfriend for Sam Witwicky. While Shia LeBeouf isn't as charismatic as he was in the first film, he does have the same charm he brought to the film series so far. The Autobots and Decepticons are great to see again and the voice actors are solid especially Leonard Nimoy as Sentinal Prime, who is a very good villain for the movie much Megatron.\n\nThen, there are the bad things that I would point out. First, the script. While the second and third halves are a lot better, the first half is pretty boring. It seems to be lacking in it's action and it wasn't exciting. Second, the ending is way too similar to the first Transformers (what? with the auto-bots and decepticons fight against each other while bringing destruction to the city and such?) The pacing is also very sluggish it would almost put you to sleep. Third and mostly the final problem is the dialog. There are some humorous bits that might get the audience a chuckle, but there are other parts that are just so inane it would give you a headache.\n\nOverall, Transformers: DOTM isn't nearly as good as the first, but despite the flaws that I just stated, I think this is a great sequel in an overall solid franchise. I may not be a fan of Michael Bay and such, but while I do not like the Bad Boys films, Pearl Harbor, and others, I think that this and the other films are a lot better and it deserves a recommendation to those who haven't seen it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-29","keywords":"job interview,year 1969,optimus prime character,robert f. kennedy character,megatron character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi543989017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTgwOTExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ0NzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTgwOTExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ0NzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Autobots learn of a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden on the Moon, and race against the Decepticons to reach it and learn its secrets, which could turn the tide in the Transformers' final battle.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2492819/","name":"Rosie Huntington-Whiteley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040938/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130376/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472567/","name":"Ehren Kruger"],"duration":"PT2H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \n\n\t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable we can relate to her.  \n\nAs Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. \n\n Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much just the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) \t\n\nI also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-10","keywords":"unfaithfulness,employer employee relationship,opposites attract,love triangle,book publishing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones's Diary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi192783897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones's Diary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536632/","name":"Sharon Maguire"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Pierce Brosnan,(Harry Dalton),"The Matador",'05, has a bad experience with the death of his wife during a volcano eruption and stayed in his profession as a geologist. Harry discovers from his charts that their could very well be another volcano problem effecting a small popular town. Linda Hamilton,(Rachel Wando),"The Kid &amp; I ",'05 is the mayor and store owner of this town, who has a boy and a girl and is divorced.

If these character premises are established and the plot flows, the final confrontation between these two arch-enemies should be breath-taking and keep the audience guessing.\n\nGladiator does this perfectly.  The boxing scenes are gripping, intense and pull the audience out of their seats to cheer for the films two heroes... Tommy Riley and Cuba.  The movie has a great soundtrack and a noticeable visual style that stays constant throughout the film.\n\nHorn (the bad guy) played by Brian Dennehy and his sidekick Pappy Jack played by Robert Loggia are a great combination of nastiness.  Horn is brutally evil and rules his underground boxing contingent with an iron fist, while Pappy Jack is a sleezy, humorous villian that compliments Horn's seriousness beautifully.\n\nThe characters have some depth, but not much.  Who needs depth in an action movie anyway? Tommy Riley, Cuba, and Romano's stations in life and their particular choices are explained adequately enough for the audience to sympathize with their situations and want them to kick some serious ass.\n\n Bottomline:\n\nA kick-ass action movie.  You will find yourself cheering loudly and rewinding parts because of their sheer intensity and visual, ass-kicking style.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8942,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1992-03-06","keywords":"hood,jock strap,boxing,debt,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gladiator (1992)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1202323737","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhNjJmMmEtYzg1NS00NWY2LWFmNmYtMjU4YmRhNmQ1MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhNjJmMmEtYzg1NS00NWY2LWFmNmYtMjU4YmRhNmQ1MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338614/","name":"James Marshall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr."},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001133/","name":"Brian Dennehy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0380705/","name":"Rowdy Herrington"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038243/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587429/","name":"Djordje Milicevic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0450361/","name":"Lyle Kessler"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If these character premises are established and the plot flows, the final confrontation between these two arch-enemies should be breath-taking and keep the audience guessing.\n\nGladiator does this perfectly.  The boxing scenes are gripping, intense and pull the audience out of their seats to cheer for the films two heroes... Tommy Riley and Cuba.  The movie has a great soundtrack and a noticeable visual style that stays constant throughout the film.\n\nHorn (the bad guy) played by Brian Dennehy and his sidekick Pappy Jack played by Robert Loggia are a great combination of nastiness.  Horn is brutally evil and rules his underground boxing contingent with an iron fist, while Pappy Jack is a sleezy, humorous villian that compliments Horn's seriousness beautifully.\n\nThe characters have some depth, but not much.  Who needs depth in an action movie anyway? Tommy Riley, Cuba, and Romano's stations in life and their particular choices are explained adequately enough for the audience to sympathize with their situations and want them to kick some serious ass.\n\n Bottomline:\n\nA kick-ass action movie.  You will find yourself cheering loudly and rewinding parts because of their sheer intensity and visual, ass-kicking style.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8942,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1992-03-06","keywords":"hood,jock strap,boxing,debt,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gladiator (1992)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1202323737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhNjJmMmEtYzg1NS00NWY2LWFmNmYtMjU4YmRhNmQ1MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhNjJmMmEtYzg1NS00NWY2LWFmNmYtMjU4YmRhNmQ1MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338614/","name":"James Marshall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001133/","name":"Brian Dennehy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0380705/","name":"Rowdy Herrington"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038243/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587429/","name":"Djordje Milicevic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0450361/","name":"Lyle Kessler"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They just can't seem to make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, I will admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my "least favorite" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. This one, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful -- this movie succeeds on every front!

Passionate stuff indeed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":275936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pride and prejudice,england,gentleman,bachelor,prejudice","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pride &amp; Prejudice","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3045130521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595738/","name":"Deborah Moggach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000807/","name":"Jane Austen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We may no longer be hunting our food, or struggling to keep the fire going, but it is still all about survival. Bushnell is great at depicting the primal hunger that, while it once made man fight to the death over territory or a fresh kill, now makes women deck themselves out in top gear and hunt down that Banker or Fortune 500 Executive, or fight tooth-and-nail to break through the glass ceiling.\n\nSecond, somewhere midlife, SATC, the show, got lost. All that incidental stuff - the shoes and bags, and places-to-be-seen - moved from the background to the foreground. The show became one long glossy luxury goods advertisement, the kind found in Vanity Fair. The movie underlines this - while there are great story lines, etc, the theatrical release is one obscene orgy of consumerism and decadence.\n\nToo bad. The last years of SATC is an insult to both the book and the early years of the show. It is certainly an insult to the public, but - considering SATC was most popular in its later years - maybe the insult is much deserved.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115347,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"friendship between women,friendship,love life,casual sex,new york city","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Aladdin" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out "The Jungle Book".\n\nI know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes "Aladdin" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie  but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. "Aladdin" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.\n\n"Kid's day in the USA!" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered "Aladdin", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.\n\nNeedless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time   it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.\n\nAnd for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.\n\nI must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for "Aladdin" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.\n\nAnd then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see   and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.\n\nI feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for "Aladdin".\n\nBut maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of "Aladdin", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":389662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1992-11-25","keywords":"genie,three wishes,genie character,arab,princess","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi677035801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQyMjRhYjUtOGM1My00OTQzLWEzZTAtOThjM2Q3OTMyNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQyMjRhYjUtOGM1My00OTQzLWEzZTAtOThjM2Q3OTMyNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918334/","name":"Scott Weinger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488306/","name":"Linda Larkin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166256/","name":"Ron Clements"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615780/","name":"John Musker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133018/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074039/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166256/","name":"Ron Clements"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615780/","name":"John Musker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254645/","name":"Ted Elliott"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Od kreatorice / scenaristice / zvijezde Isse Rae, serija "Nesigurna" bavi se nerazdvojnom grupom prijateljica, milenijalki i crnkinja koje navigiraju neugodnim i formativnim iskustvima u srcu L. A.-a. Iako je sputava Molly, dugogodišnja najbolja prijateljica i korporativna odvjetnica koja se sjajno snalazi pred raznim odborima, ali ne i s osjećajima, Issa je strastvena graditeljica zajednice iz Inglewooda čija neodlučnost često omete njezinu viziju. Radnja se nastavlja nedugo nakon što su obje prijateljice dobile nogu od svojih partnera. Peta i posljednja sezona prati naše glavne junakinje, uz smiješnu Kelli i zahtjevnu Tiffany, kako pokušavaju stati na noge i nastaviti sa životom.</desc>

This ill conceived, miscast, puerile piece of garbage has very little to do with the late Mr. Porter's actual life and even less to do with his music. The movie even admits on a certain level that it's a fake by using footage from another horribly miscast biopic about Cole Porter, starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith! \n\nAnother review I've read mentions that: "At the first night parties there seemed a disproportionately high number of black people as guests, and also in other scenes." Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life, especially while in New York, was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary, there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's, shall we say..."Night Parties". Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then, start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued, there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search. For the time investment of a few simple key-strokes and mouse clicks, you'll be able to learn and truly appreciate more about Cole Porter, his life, his music and his genius, than this blanched, consumptive Kevin Kline vehicle could ever hope to provide."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then, start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued, there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search. For the time investment of a few simple key-strokes and mouse clicks, you'll be able to learn and truly appreciate more about Cole Porter, his life, his music and his genius, than this blanched, consumptive Kevin Kline vehicle could ever hope to provide.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

HBO donosi premijeru treće sezone za "Emmy" nominirane humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. Dok prati vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), serija duhovito kritizira svakodnevnu uredsku politiku drugog najvažnijeg ureda u zemlji. Nakon otkrića na kraju druge sezone da se predsjednik neće kandidirati za nove izbore, treća sezona počinje tako što Selina, željna promaknuća, vrbuje stranačke aktiviste Iowe na potpisivanju svoje nove knjige "Neki novi počeci". Uskoro se Selina i njezino osoblje vraćaju u Washington za Mikeovo vjenčanje i saznaju da je ministar obrane Maddox dao ostavku.</desc>

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing.

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box. I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.\n\nNow after Shazam!, Aquaman &amp; the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.\n\nHere's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:\n\nThe movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.\n\nBirds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras &amp; the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.\n\nSome of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters &amp; Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!\n\nNow, let's talk about Margot Robbie &amp; Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye . Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.\n\nIt also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.\n\nFinal battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.\n\nNow, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!\n\nBecause of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.\n\nSo many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.\n\nHyena &amp; police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.\n\nWhile this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.\n\nVerdict: Imaginative &amp; darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-02-07","keywords":"harley quinn character,police,hyena,spin off,chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Birds of Prey Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3883843353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001609/","name":"Rosie Perez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4014166/","name":"Cathy Yan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0693170/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5429637/","name":"Christina Hodson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227704/","name":"Paul Dini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863622/","name":"Bruce Timm"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly.

Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman &amp; Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze "You're not sending me to the cooler", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

HBO donosi premijeru treće sezone za "Emmy" nominirane humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. Dok prati vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), serija duhovito kritizira svakodnevnu uredsku politiku drugog najvažnijeg ureda u zemlji. Nakon otkrića na kraju druge sezone da se predsjednik neće kandidirati za nove izbore, treća sezona počinje tako što Selina, željna promaknuća, vrbuje stranačke aktiviste Iowe na potpisivanju svoje nove knjige "Neki novi počeci". Uskoro se Selina i njezino osoblje vraćaju u Washington za Mikeovo vjenčanje i saznaju da je ministar obrane Maddox dao ostavku.</desc>

Temeljena na njezinu životu, druga sezona serije RADOVI U TIJEKU nastavlja se s McEnanynim likom Abby nakon njezina prekida (i nakon što je gotovo ostala bez badema). 46-godišnja samoprozvana, debela, queer dajkica Abby nezadovoljno prihvaća da je previše zauzeta da bi se ubila. Zapravo, ona se taman počinje izvlačiti iz problema... kad se globalna pandemija spoji s obiteljskom krizom i natjera je na neistraženi teritorij. U glavnoj je ulozi Abby McEnany.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija"Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka. Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija "Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka u potrazi za ljubavlju, stabilnom vezom, razumjevanjem, seksom... Carrie Bradshaw je njujorška novinarka koja svoja opažanja o ljubavi i strasti objavljuje u kolumni "Seks i grad". Inspiracije joj ne nedostaje, jer sve što mora jeste saslušati svoje prijateljice dok joj se povjeravaju ili prepričavaju svoj posljednji izlazak. Uz nju su Samantha, vlasnica PR agencije, koja je na samačkoj sceni vidjela i isprobala sve, galeristica Charlotte koja još vjeruje da ljubav pobjeđuje sve i cinična Miranda, advokatica u velikoj kompaniji koja ima najmanje vremena za romanse, jer joj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života. Tema za Carriene kolumne je i Faca, zgodni i misteriozni tajkun koji joj uvijek ubrza otkucaje srca. Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon i Sarah Jessica Parker uče nas važne lekcije o seksu, ljubavi, muškim i ženskim tajnama, uspješnim i neuspješnim taktikama, ispunjenim očekivanjima, skrivenim strahovima. Kada su u pitanju muškarci, veze i odnosi, ne možemo a da se ne zapitamo - da li smo zaista naučili sve?</desc>
