I was told by a good friend that it was extremely slow, and be prepared to be bored out of "my mind." Well, I wasn't bored, maybe because I now expected a slower, non-action-packed CIA-type film....and I wasn't disappointed. Actually, I liked it, mainly because of the cinematography. This is stunning in its photography. Kudos to Director Robert De Niro and Director of Photography Robert Richardson for their work in here.\n\nI also appreciated the low profanity in here. After watching "The Departed," this far-cleaner film was a treat for the ears, too. Yes, there are a handful of 'f-words," but not much else including no blasphemy.\n\nBut, I agree that this is a very slow film and it helps to know that in advance. It's also one you have to follow closely and time periods shift back and forth, mainly from 1961 back to the early 1940s. \n\nThe story winds up presenting an interesting question which is posed to Matt Damon's character, "Edward Wilson." He plays an extremely loyal CIA man, a guy who is straight-arrow and one whose priority is country-first. The dilemma occurs at the end when he must choose between what's best for his son or his country. \n\nIt's a thought-out, interesting story that takes a few sides to the left of center more than the right, but is not really a movie with any heavy-handed political agenda, mainly pointing out what it takes to be a successful "spy" and that this unemotional detachment can be rough on some people and their families.\n\nDamon heads an all-star cast that includes Angeline Jolie (who looks spectacular as a woman in the early 1940s), Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton and many others.\n\nThis movie, I suspect, will either put you to sleep or fascinate you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-12-22","keywords":"year 1962,year 1960,year 1958,year 1947,year 1945","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"}],"duration":"PT2H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After reading some of these reviews, it makes me want to read the book though.

I'm not Scottish or even British so I can't really comment on Pierce Brosnan's accent, but I don't think his acting was bad like some have said.  I thought he was quite good, but I wasn't distracted by the accent like some were. That could be a deterrent.  Overall, I liked it though.  After reading some of these reviews, it makes me want to read the book though.  Sounds very interesting and I do agree that they shouldn't have advertised it as James DaFoe's Robinson Crusoe if it wasn't faithful to the book.  I give it about a 7.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12202,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-06-12","keywords":"female removes her clothes,striptease,female rear nudity,female nudity,stranded on an island","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robinson Crusoe","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1037082137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzA1NGYyNTQtYzk3OC00NDY4LTg0MTEtZTM4ZTA1YjNjODQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzA1NGYyNTQtYzk3OC00NDY4LTg0MTEtZTM4ZTA1YjNjODQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847261/","name":"William Takaku","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908116/","name":"Polly Walker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362738/","name":"Rod Hardy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004305/","name":"George Miller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013824/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214518/","name":"Daniel Defoe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0517465/","name":"Christopher Lofton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0944003/","name":"Tracy Keenan Wynn"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It felt more like a scene from 'Hostel'. \n\nThe first film is a rare beauty, and Wolf Creek 2 is a good sequel - nothing more, nothing less IMO.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-02-20","keywords":"characters murdered one by one,psychopathic murderer,slasher murderer,tourist,crime spree","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wolf Creek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1774303769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Wolf Creek 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418877/","name":"John Jarratt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1507708/","name":"Ryan Corr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590140/","name":"Shannon Ashlyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036887/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048683/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1846103/","name":"Aaron Sterns"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable romp, with some affecting performances. There is nothing revelatory or even unpredictable about the story, but it works nicely and certainly entertains. The film does have a few rich moments, but seems mostly a vehicle for a group of talented actors (and it is a highly pedigreed bunch here) to take decent material and put out a fun and sometimes very moving film.\n\nWhile it may drag a little in the center, don't give up watching for the finale and Rachel Griffiths "total look" finish that is about as outrageous and breathtaking a "total look" as one can possibly imagine. The normally brilliant Alan Rickman here sometimes feels just a little bit on autopilot, American Josh Hartnett is vastly underused, but surprisingly effective in an important role and Natasha Richardson, as ever, positively glows on the screen and raises the emotional and dramatic stakes to a level that makes the whole affair worthwhile.\n\nNot great?

Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable romp, with some affecting performances. There is nothing revelatory or even unpredictable about the story, but it works nicely and certainly entertains. The film does have a few rich moments, but seems mostly a vehicle for a group of talented actors (and it is a highly pedigreed bunch here) to take decent material and put out a fun and sometimes very moving film.\n\nWhile it may drag a little in the center, don't give up watching for the finale and Rachel Griffiths "total look" finish that is about as outrageous and breathtaking a "total look" as one can possibly imagine. The normally brilliant Alan Rickman here sometimes feels just a little bit on autopilot, American Josh Hartnett is vastly underused, but surprisingly effective in an important role and Natasha Richardson, as ever, positively glows on the screen and raises the emotional and dramatic stakes to a level that makes the whole affair worthwhile.\n\nNot great? Perhaps, but an immensely enjoyable little movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8297,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-03-30","keywords":"bride and groom figurine,hair clippers,barber shop,hair salon,bed and breakfast","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blow Dry","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2481888793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5ZjA2M2ItNWEzMi00NzZhLTllOTMtOGJlNTY1MTlkY2Y1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5ZjA2M2ItNWEzMi00NzZhLTllOTMtOGJlNTY1MTlkY2Y1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000614/","name":"Alan Rickman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001670/","name":"Natasha Richardson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0341737/","name":"Rachel Griffiths"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0106456/","name":"Paddy Breathnach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071425/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Never have I seen a kiddie flick come along which is so clean, and yet still so entertaining at the same time. This odd blend of one of the best (The Matrix) and worst (Baby Geniuses) movies of 1999 is surprisingly exciting for something so "PG", and director and writer Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) manages to create loads of fun while still keeping the violence level down.\n\nHe manages to do all this by being incredibly inventive with his special effects. "Spy Kid's" is a visual fun house of ideas which are all so playfully intuned with kids and their level of interest. He comes up with things such as movable thumb people and floors that fall apart like puzzle pieces. Rodriguez also has a lot of fun with this topic, putting in loads of high tech equipment and transportation, which offer kids and adults an incredible ride which is most always played for humor and thrills.\n\nThe basic set up for "Spy Kids" is this. Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) were both spies working for different agencies, when a "hit" put out on each other brings them closer together. They decide to put away the spy work and live normal lives as husband and wife, and soon father and mother.\n\nBut the perfect family they dream about is far from. Their kids are keeping secrets from them, a trait from their former job that they feel they have passed on to their children. Their daughter Carmen (Alexa Vega) is skipping school, while Juni (Daryl Sabara) is being bullied at school and instead of telling his parents, just makes up a couple of imaginary friends.\n\nThey see how their past lives have affected their children, but before they can correct their wrong, their past catches up with them. They are thrown back into the spy game to investigate the capture of several other spies, but only end up being captured themselves.\n\nThe culprit also just happens to be Juni's favorite televison star, Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). Floop is after a brain prototype that Gregorio created years ago. If he can implant that into the heads of his robot and mutant henchmen, nothing can stop him from taking over the world and becoming the number one rated show on TV.

Never have I seen a kiddie flick come along which is so clean, and yet still so entertaining at the same time. This odd blend of one of the best (The Matrix) and worst (Baby Geniuses) movies of 1999 is surprisingly exciting for something so "PG", and director and writer Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) manages to create loads of fun while still keeping the violence level down.\n\nHe manages to do all this by being incredibly inventive with his special effects. "Spy Kid's" is a visual fun house of ideas which are all so playfully intuned with kids and their level of interest. He comes up with things such as movable thumb people and floors that fall apart like puzzle pieces. Rodriguez also has a lot of fun with this topic, putting in loads of high tech equipment and transportation, which offer kids and adults an incredible ride which is most always played for humor and thrills.\n\nThe basic set up for "Spy Kids" is this. Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) were both spies working for different agencies, when a "hit" put out on each other brings them closer together. They decide to put away the spy work and live normal lives as husband and wife, and soon father and mother.\n\nBut the perfect family they dream about is far from. Their kids are keeping secrets from them, a trait from their former job that they feel they have passed on to their children. Their daughter Carmen (Alexa Vega) is skipping school, while Juni (Daryl Sabara) is being bullied at school and instead of telling his parents, just makes up a couple of imaginary friends.\n\nThey see how their past lives have affected their children, but before they can correct their wrong, their past catches up with them. They are thrown back into the spy game to investigate the capture of several other spies, but only end up being captured themselves.\n\nThe culprit also just happens to be Juni's favorite televison star, Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). Floop is after a brain prototype that Gregorio created years ago. If he can implant that into the heads of his robot and mutant henchmen, nothing can stop him from taking over the world and becoming the number one rated show on TV. But his other human henchmen Minion (played dastardly well by Tony Shalhoub) has other plans. Back home, the feuding siblings must learn to work together in order to save their parents and the world as they are tossed into the spy game as well.\n\nIt seems as if the best kids movies always have a family-like theme to them, and "Spy Kids" is no exception. Much of this movie is exciting, but then there are those other parts, which are to cuteness what Charlie's Angels was to sexy clad women. Some may accuse Rodriguez of turning corny on us all of a sudden, but luckily he is also working with some very funny material here, as well as with newcomer Daryl Sabara.\n\nHis partner Alexa Vega also comes off very strong in her role as his sister.

Last year, the highlight of the festival for me was American Beauty.  This year, it would have to be (so far) Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".\n\nBeing of Asian descent, I've seen my share of wu xia genre movies to last me a life time.  However, most of them are so centred on the fighting, that they forget the rest of the elements that are involed.  The movie turns into one long scripted fighting scene with maybe a slight hint of story. Crouching Tiger, on the other hand realizes these issues, and builds these oh-so entertaining action sequences into an epic with typical asian themes such as true love and honour.\n\nBeing an epic, one would expect the usual long takes and establishing shots, and boy does it ever look beautiful.  Traversing through a myriad of regions spanning the lengh of China (from the deserts to bamboo forests, to mountains high in the clouds), the film soley based on its asthetic properties is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour.  And then there's the cinemetography.  Wow!  The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous.  If your jaw dropped when you saw Rome and its coliseum in Gladiator, wait until you see ancient Beijing recreated on the screen!\n\nOkay, so it's a good looking movie.  What about the story?  The complexity of the plot is rather sparse, probably reminiscent of epics such as Braveheart or Gladiator, which is by no means a bad thing.  Although both Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeo did have major parts, this movie belongs mostly to Zhang Ziyi who IMHO did an amazing job playing a very complex role (one which required her to represent nobily as a princess, naivness, as well as show inner strength).  Mainly concentrating on her unwillingness to give in to the ideals of an arranged marriage, the decently written script adds a story of an old warrior trying to retire and a 300+ year old sword.\n\nAll in all, this film blends story, well choreographed action, and a stylistic eye to create a mythilogical piece that not only represents the wu xia genre justly by doing it well, but also contributes to raising the quality of filmmaking usually applied in the making of a similar type of film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260429,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Absolutely no comparison. This is the most realistic show about a SF unit that I have seen. Though not without it's technical imperfections, the interaction , dedication, and brotherhood between these men is the most realistic I've seen depicted in a television series. The casual wise cracks, character interaction, and frequent jokes made to diffuse the stress of the mission, deployments and balancing family/personal life, is greatly portrayed. Bravo from a 26-year vet.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2017-09-27","keywords":"u.s. military,military,acronym in title,military uniform,nco","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004770/","name":"David Boreanaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1302735/","name":"Max Thieriot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112932/","name":"Neil Brown Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0666604/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0665583/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0280908/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3859706/","name":"Benjamin Cavell"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3313809689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzNhOTQzM2YtZjc1ZC00ODExLTgzODAtNmQyNDI1MjhiMjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzNhOTQzM2YtZjc1ZC00ODExLTgzODAtNmQyNDI1MjhiMjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Follow the lives of the most elite unit of Navy SEALs as they train, plan and execute the most dangerous missions our country can ask of them."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even if you don't normally like animation this is worth watching as it is a good story which is well told.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20822,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2001-05-26","keywords":"robot,synthetic human,city,future,based on comic book","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metropolis","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3878271001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4NDAxYjEtNWRkMi00Y2ZhLTk5ZWQtMmFkODI5NmFlYjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4NDAxYjEtNWRkMi00Y2ZhLTk5ZWQtMmFkODI5NmFlYjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Metropolis","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299192/","name":"Toshio Furukawa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918334/","name":"Scott Weinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131157/","name":"Yuka Imoto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0727336/","name":"Rintaro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080697/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064941/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0856804/","name":"Osamu Tezuka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0960028/","name":"Katsuhiro Ôtomo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359584/","name":"Marc Handler"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nekoliko dana prije ispita Bradford i Lopez otkriju da Lucy i Jackson nisu svjedočili svim vrstama zločina, za što im je još ostalo 48 sati. Nolanu nije dodijeljen zadatak na terenu pa ostaje u uredu, dok Talia odgovara pred Unutarnjom kontrolom. Nolan ipak odlučuje pridružiti se Wolfeu. Na ulici Jackson i Lucy nalaze Bena, posljednju žrtvu organiziranih kradljivaca vozila. Na kraju Nolan pomaže uloviti kradljivce, a kasnije stane u obranu Talije pred Unutarnjom kontrolom.</desc>

Nolan i Bredford, koji je imao samo alergijsku reakciju na primljene lijekove, obračunaju se s teroristom. Dva tjedna kasnije, Nolan je u svom novom domu, dok novaci primaju rezultate položenih ispita. Svi su prošli, no West je sumnjičav prema rezutatima. Nakon što su Nolan i Grey svjedočili pljački u trgovini policijske uniforme tim doznaje za plan koji uključuje lažno uniformirane policajce. Kasnije pronalaze jednog od pljačkaša mrtvog nakon što su ga partneri ubili i zapalili njegovo tijelo.</desc>

Nolan i Bredford, koji je imao samo alergijsku reakciju na primljene lijekove, obračunaju se s teroristom. Dva tjedna kasnije, Nolan je u svom novom domu, dok novaci primaju rezultate položenih ispita. Svi su prošli, no West je sumnjičav prema rezutatima. Nakon što su Nolan i Grey svjedočili pljački u trgovini policijske uniforme tim doznaje za plan koji uključuje lažno uniformirane policajce. Kasnije pronalaze jednog od pljačkaša mrtvog nakon što su ga partneri ubili i zapalili njegovo tijelo.</desc>

I heard interviews with Martin Sheen himself and a great double interview with Martin and Emilio on Irish radio. I did a part of the camino in 2009 and It was a life changing/enhancing experience for me so I couldn't wait to see how the film would deal with it. Yesterday I saw the film in the Screen cinema in College Green Dublin. The film is, in my opinion, very true to the camino experience. A previous reviewer trivialised it as "a road movie" and suggested "wizard of Oz" characterisation. The camino "road" has been travelled for over a thousand years. Long before "road movies" were even thought about and yes, any story of fellow travellers sharing their stories on a journey, can be similar to the "wizard of Oz" but I think Chaucers "Canterbury Tales" is probably the true origin of the species. The camino de Santiago in its reality, and in this film, is a wonderful kaleidoscopic confluence of humanity. Pilgrims seem to self-select for certain character traits such as eccentricity, other worldliness, joyfullness, adventurousness, hurt, curiosity etc. Tom's companions were all from the palette of characters I found on the camino. Tom himself was an accidental pilgrim and only at the end of the camino did he allow himself to fall in love with it like the others. Tom, the cynical skeptic, driven to put one foot in front of another as a way of dealing with the brokenness of his relationship with his son and the trauma of his sudden death, allows the distance required to allow viewers share in the journey of the Camino in a way that could not have been achieved by following four "ordinary" pilgrims, no matter how colourful. Tom was the "straight man", the foil, that allowed the full colours of all the other characters to shine through. I thought it was a brilliant piece of cinema.

And if not for the laughs, I'm sure Jennifer Aniston stripping would do the trick.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":421043,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-09-25","keywords":"stripper,girl in panties,wet panties,thong panties,white panties","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi544319001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYwMjM0NzU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI2ODU1OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYwMjM0NzU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI2ODU1OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A veteran pot dealer creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico.

Who defines what actions are good? Or if good people are not capable of doing bad things? And would that make them bad people? Don't get it twisted though: This is not a philosophical look at those things. If you even remotely asks those questions, it's not because the movie intended to make you think that much.

I had a great time with this film and i would recommend it to everybody who wants to experience a heart-breaking story that is actually realistic and authentic.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54377,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2016-09-02","keywords":"lighthouse,husband wife relationship,lighthouse keeper,loss of husband,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2715005977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NzQwMTY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExMDA5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NzQwMTY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExMDA5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A drama centered around a lighthouse keeper and his wife who live off the coast of Western Australia.

The story of the ambitious twenty-seven year old Adam Cassidy with debts in the hospital for the expensive treatment of his father that in a couple of days becomes an important executive of a corporation competitor of the company that he was fired is totally absurd. He uses US$ 16,000 in the corporation card to party and what would he expect? Therefore, the tight spot that he is in is caused by a ridiculous situation. The coincidence of having one night stand with Emma Jennings is another unbelievable part of the screenplay. The unethical Adam Cassidy should have been in prison for a long period, since his lack of character and manipulation are disgusting. Emma returning to him is also incredible for an intelligent woman that was used. But forgetting these ridiculous situations, the viewer can enjoy the beauty of Amber Heard; the always great Gary Oldman and Richard Dreyfuss; see Josh "Sawyer" Holloway once again; and a good cast with Harrison Ford, Embeth Davidtz, Julian McMahon and Liam Hemsworth. Shutdown your brain and you may have a good time.

The story of the ambitious twenty-seven year old Adam Cassidy with debts in the hospital for the expensive treatment of his father that in a couple of days becomes an important executive of a corporation competitor of the company that he was fired is totally absurd. He uses US$ 16,000 in the corporation card to party and what would he expect? Therefore, the tight spot that he is in is caused by a ridiculous situation. The coincidence of having one night stand with Emma Jennings is another unbelievable part of the screenplay. The unethical Adam Cassidy should have been in prison for a long period, since his lack of character and manipulation are disgusting. Emma returning to him is also incredible for an intelligent woman that was used. But forgetting these ridiculous situations, the viewer can enjoy the beauty of Amber Heard; the always great Gary Oldman and Richard Dreyfuss; see Josh "Sawyer" Holloway once again; and a good cast with Harrison Ford, Embeth Davidtz, Julian McMahon and Liam Hemsworth. Shutdown your brain and you may have a good time. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Conexão Perigosa" ("Dangerous Connection")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35979,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-08-16","keywords":"spying,thumbprint,traffic,man wears a swimsuit,man wrapped in a towel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3075778073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The two most powerful tech billionaires in the world are bitter rivals with a complicated past.

But the film's morality is more dubious than it recognises","reviewBody":"Director Gavin Hood's previous film, the underrated Ender's Game, focused upon the increasingly virtual, high-tech surveillance and disengaged nature of modern warfare. These elements of Ender's Game are clearly visible in the director's latest thriller offering, Eye in the Sky. The story here involves disparate groups of military and political personnel scattered around the world, all watching the live stream of a terrorist compound in Nairobi and debating whether or not to fire a drone into a heavily-populated ethnically Somali suburb of the Kenyan capital.\n\nThe operation is shown to be a joint British and American backed mission and the debate revolves around the collateral damage a drone strike would cause. The collateral damage is given a human face through a young girl who has set up a bread stall near the compound. Eye in the Sky's original title was "Kill Chain" and the reasoning becomes evident as the rest of the film involves people referring up the chain of command to avoid making a decision. The running time consists mainly of people talking to each other on phones and via video screens, however Hood manages to make these scenes some of the tensest, most cinematic, Skype calls you will ever see.\n\nEye in the Sky highlights the "hawk" and "dove" nature of the politicians of the two countries involved, one memorable scene being the US Secretary of State angry that his game of table tennis is interrupted because the British are dithering. However, the film's demonstration of realpolitik was weaker and has been presented far more successfully in Armando Iannucci's In the Loop, a film based on the run-up to the Iraq War. The film also lacked any strong, coherent argument against the drone strike apart from the contrived little girl selling bread nearby; not touching at all on the long-term consequences of dropping a bomb on a Somali suburb. The film reduces the complicated morality of drone warfare to a simplistic choice: it's either this little girl or a terrorist attack in a busy shopping mall. There's no concern however for civilians nearby who aren't cute children, or that the potential civilian casualties from this attack could be used by Al Shabab to garner more support amongst the population.\n\nAlan Rickman is fantastically dry in his last on-screen role as a British Lieutenant General and Aaron Paul is also very impressive, despite spending the majority of the film in a Portacabin with his finger hovering over the trigger. But while Eye in the Sky may be one of the year's most gripping thrillers, the film's morality is more dubious rather than ambiguous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-04-15","keywords":"drone pilot,terrorist cell,drone strike,terrorist,collateral damage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1137947161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"UK-based military officer Colonel Katherine Powell is in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya.

Condon has quite evidently put a lot of effort into writing and directing the film, and without much question, his efforts have paid off with success.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"sexuality,character name as title,surname as title,lgbt plus,sex","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kinsey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224292121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001473/","name":"Laura Linney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While "Slumdog Millionaire" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.\n\n"Slumdog Millionaire" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.\n\nDanny Boyle ("28 Days Later," "Sunshine") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.\n\nWhile the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. "Slumdog" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.\n\nIt's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. \n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":817213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Unfortunately the concept, and the movie as a whole tends to fall apart if you look at it too hard.\n\nTo its credit, I'm not sure how hard it's really trying. It at times seems to take itself seriously and then at other points not at all. The performances are all... There. Nothing really great to report.

A Mumbai teenager reflects on his life after being accused of cheating on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1010048/","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjZWI3NzktYWI1Mi00OTAyLWJkNTYtMzUwYTFlZDA0Y2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Mumbai teenager reflects on his life after being accused of cheating on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?".","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1010048/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Movie_Muse_Reviews"},"dateCreated":"2008-12-22","inLanguage":"English","name":""Slumdog" beautifully bridges life in India and Western film","reviewBody":"It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While "Slumdog Millionaire" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.\n\n"Slumdog Millionaire" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.\n\nDanny Boyle ("28 Days Later," "Sunshine") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.\n\nWhile the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one.

 --- Description: Slumdog Millionaire: Directed by Danny Boyle, Loveleen Tandan. With Dev Patel, Saurabh Shukla, Anil Kapoor, Raj Zutshi. A Mumbai teenager reflects on his life after being accused of cheating on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1010048/","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjZWI3NzktYWI1Mi00OTAyLWJkNTYtMzUwYTFlZDA0Y2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Mumbai teenager reflects on his life after being accused of cheating on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?".","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1010048/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Movie_Muse_Reviews","dateCreated":"2008-12-22","inLanguage":"English","name":""Slumdog" beautifully bridges life in India and Western film","reviewBody":"It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While "Slumdog Millionaire" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.\n\n"Slumdog Millionaire" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.\n\nDanny Boyle ("28 Days Later," "Sunshine") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.\n\nWhile the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. "Slumdog" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.\n\nIt's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do.

The gaunt features of the actors seemed tailor made for this instructive entertainment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2007-03-22","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,pubic hair,inmate,nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Counterfeiters","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2364539161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThmZDg1N2EtNmY5YS00NmNlLWFkZDAtNmRkM2E3MzIxYWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThmZDg1N2EtNmY5YS00NmNlLWFkZDAtNmRkM2E3MzIxYWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548686/","name":"Karl Markovics","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225944/","name":"August Diehl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0834479/","name":"Devid Striesow"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752328/","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002528/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0128215/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2542195/","name":"Adolf Burger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752328/","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say "I'm king of the world" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.\n\nThe modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery.

The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.\n\nHowever,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound.

James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancée,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}\n\nOverall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should.

I saw it at the theater in 1997 along with about 7 other women...we all went to the theater alone because our hubbies refused to take us! Seriously...I did not know one single woman in the theater that day! We all loved the movie right off...\n\nMy sister bought it and we watched it with captioning, and boy had we missed a lot of lines at the theater and funny ones at that! You see with the English accents and all their slang-- you just can't understand a lot of what they are saying...\n\nWatch this movie with and without the captioning! It's like watching a movie with English being your second language, and I B.S. you not!\n\nThe English working class has a different way of expressing themselves--its so charming and hilarious...\n\nI think Robert Carlysle is brilliant "Gaz". I cannot think of anyone who could have done it better. \n\nThis movie cannot be beat! I bought it and recommend it to everyone!!

If you're going to re-make "The Magnificent 7" let's do it magnificently. Where was that great music? Where is the superlative cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly entertaining.\n\nThis is a modern re-telling. You might call it the Diversity 7. The producers threw in just about every minority you can think of – Mexican, Asian, Black, Woman.

If you're going to re-make "The Magnificent 7" let's do it magnificently. Where was that great music? Where is the superlative cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly entertaining.\n\nThis is a modern re-telling. You might call it the Diversity 7. The producers threw in just about every minority you can think of – Mexican, Asian, Black, Woman. The only thing missing was a "little" person .\n\nPersonally I liked the idea of the woman, played very well by Haley Bennett who has been with Washington before ("The Equalizer").\n\nAn action film like this works only when the villain is villainous.

As you probably know the Manhattan Project was a research and development project for the first Atomic Bomb, thus the name of the show Manh(A)ttan with the middle A stylized as separated.\n\nThe series follows the lives of the families living in a strict, military controlled, village in the middle of the desert. In that place paranoia rules. Because of the big secret (the development of the "gadget" as they call it) everyone is considered a possible leak or a suspect for espionage. Their correspondence to the outside world is controlled, the army makes random checks to them and their belongings, they even have to take polygraph tests if they seem more suspicious than others.\n\nThe production has nothing to envy from a feature film. Attention to detail. Countless extras and above all a remarkable cinematography. The way they make you feel the "space", the atmosphere of this place is extraordinary. \n\nI hope it will continue in the same fashion and not consume itself in many subplots and little dramas that will make it tiresome. (If it does, it wouldn't be the first time a great pilot is followed by mediocre episodes). But for now...\n\n***Highly recommended.\n\nUPDATE after having seen 9 episodes\n\nUnfortunately my fears have been realized. The show is full of pointless subplots and is now boring and far from entertaining.\n\nOppenheimer's screen time is measured in ...seconds in the 10 hours I wasted to watch this.\n\nThe race for the atomic bomb and WW2 is almost absent.\n\nIt's all about the lives and the little dramas of the wives, the mistresses and the ..$2 prostitutes who live in the camp. Who gets high with what, who is screwing whom etc.\n\nMaybe they should change the title to MANHATTAN HOUSEWIVES.\n\n***Overall: Avoid it. I'm changing my rating from 8 to a (very generous) 4.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8086,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,headstrong woman,detective,surname in series title,equality for women","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.\n\nThe year is 1965 and an eccentric young Detective Constable, Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans), is making waves at the Oxford City Police with not only his unorthodox but brilliant methods of deduction, but for his refusal to tow the line in order to please the upper echelons of both the Force and society. Under the steadfast guidance of the seasoned and similarly incorruptible, Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), Morse finds himself embroiled in a number of complex cases that expose him to the darker side of life and human nature.\n\nAlthough the series will naturally draw comparisons to its popular predecessor, thanks to the show's gripping narratives, vibrant swinging sixties backdrop and perfect blend of light and dark overtones, Endeavour is easily able to distinguish itself by its own considerable merits. \n\nMuch of the show's success can be attributed to the ingenious casting of Evans, who puts his own unique stamp on the iconic role. Of course there are parallels to the world weary DI so expertly embodied by John Thaw, but Evans wisely avoids imitation, as the twenty-year age difference between the two interpretations allows the actor to create something fresh. The addition of the character of Fred Thursday is inspired. The street wise, war veteran is the perfect mentor for the idealistic Morse and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series. Fantastic entertainment on every level!\n\nhttp://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has all the elements to make it an award winning piece. Great complicated characters that work well with each other, mystery, intrigue, excitement, shell shock, suggestive, authentic and genuine. Who new that Germany had the ability to produce a show like this that would compete with BBC period series. It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s. The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it.

I am watching with someone who is hard of hearing and has to mostly read the script. Last night they were talking of furniture in the French Louis XV style. It is always read as Louis the fifteenth or often in French Quinze (pronounced cans - and that is exactly what the close caption said in the style of Louis cans - I had to explain that one to my mom!) Then a few moments later, Miss Marple talked about the problem of yarn balls vs skeins, except the close caption said yarn scans. So confusing for the reader. There are mistakes and horrible scripting throughout almost every episode.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6990,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-12-12","keywords":"united kingdom,murder,detective,female detective,england","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568603/","name":"Geraldine McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571549/","name":"Julia McKenzie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161410/","name":"Stephen Churchett"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104279/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103605/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041824/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4158173977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,headstrong woman,detective,surname in series title,equality for women","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's like the writer just force that to happen.\n\nThere are many ridiculous moments, and forced story. That biological dad got the wrong baby, it is just like really weird. It's like it's in the story just to prolong the duration.\n\nThe lead character is bad. She is that mom in Boyhood. She was OK in there, but she is really bad in this series. The other character is typical stereotype with the "cyber" theme, Geek, Hacker, and Gamer.\n\nIt's not original it's just rehash of detective TV show with forced Cyber theme.

It looks really cool thou :D, but still terrible :(.\n\n"If the crime is using electronic device, it is for Cyber crime unit". O, man I think that is kidnapping there. how the cyber crime unit took the case, it just doesn't make any sense. It's like the writer just force that to happen.\n\nThere are many ridiculous moments, and forced story. That biological dad got the wrong baby, it is just like really weird. It's like it's in the story just to prolong the duration.\n\nThe lead character is bad. She is that mom in Boyhood. She was OK in there, but she is really bad in this series. The other character is typical stereotype with the "cyber" theme, Geek, Hacker, and Gamer.\n\nIt's not original it's just rehash of detective TV show with forced Cyber theme. Overall it is bad show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10547,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-03-04","keywords":"copaganda,21st century,shared universe,fbi federal bureau of investigation,computer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000099/","name":"Patricia Arquette","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004735/","name":"James Van Der Beek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510168/","name":"Shad Moss"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039979/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0464026/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

One poster missed the point entirely when he wrote that all of the detectives working for her submitted their resignations after the first meeting because she was a real bitch. They submitted their requests for transfer BEFORE EVEN MEETING HER. Under the circumstances, her behavior was pretty restrained. How I wish I could think up some of the responses she comes up with -- and had the guts to utter them!\n\nAnd what's with the comments on her clothing? If Sipowicz had shown up, would you have questioned his credibility as a leader because he doesn't look like he walked off the pages of GQ? Few men in my workplace look like they spend a lot of time thinking about their wardrobe (to their credit, imo); why do you hold women to such a ridiculous standard? \n\nI love the junk food theme. When was the last time you saw a fresh green salad in a police department? Oh to be starving and to see only donuts (forbidden food) lying around!\n\nShe's human -- a little bedraggled sometimes, a little neurotic about what she eats, not a paragon of organization... why can't you find that likable?

Tough Crowd!!","reviewBody":"When reading the previous reviews, one person complained about the title song not being the original version and 2 others complained about the show not being original. \n\nI came to this show because I tend to enjoy the two leads in their previous work and I enjoy shows of a similar style such as Rookie Blue, Burn Notice, Suits, etc.\n\nThis is a light entertainment admittedly, but definitely worth watching. You have 2 charismatic leads plus a really good ensemble. If you ever enjoyed Castle for the secondary characters such as the relationship between father and daughter or the two detectives working with Beckett, you should enjoy this show. \n\nThe stories are simple but also make sense for the type of work that is supposed to be represented. This is not a spy story or a cop show although there are interactions with police and they do resolve crimes. It is more about family and interpersonal relationships.\n\nAlso, if you live in Canada, it is really great seeing a show with so many recognizable sites and images. Normally, shows shot in Canada will usually use scenery that can easily be seen as American so as to aid in either international sales in the case of purely Canadian productions, or are being exclusively produced for an American network. This show does not hide that it is filmed here and I applaud the producers for this. \n\nBased on the episodes that I have seen so far, I hope that Private Eyes comes back for a second season. If it does, I know I will be watching.\n\nCheers!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4041,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-05-26","keywords":"hockey,body part in title,body part in series title,two word series title,two word title","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000594/","name":"Jason Priestley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120797/","name":"Cindy Sampson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281284/","name":"Barry Flatman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150938/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2850421/","name":"Tim Kilby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259275/","name":"Shelley Eriksen"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Private Eyes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi576699417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Private Eyes"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Tough Crowd!!","reviewBody":"When reading the previous reviews, one person complained about the title song not being the original version and 2 others complained about the show not being original. \n\nI came to this show because I tend to enjoy the two leads in their previous work and I enjoy shows of a similar style such as Rookie Blue, Burn Notice, Suits, etc.\n\nThis is a light entertainment admittedly, but definitely worth watching. You have 2 charismatic leads plus a really good ensemble. If you ever enjoyed Castle for the secondary characters such as the relationship between father and daughter or the two detectives working with Beckett, you should enjoy this show. \n\nThe stories are simple but also make sense for the type of work that is supposed to be represented. This is not a spy story or a cop show although there are interactions with police and they do resolve crimes. It is more about family and interpersonal relationships.\n\nAlso, if you live in Canada, it is really great seeing a show with so many recognizable sites and images. Normally, shows shot in Canada will usually use scenery that can easily be seen as American so as to aid in either international sales in the case of purely Canadian productions, or are being exclusively produced for an American network. This show does not hide that it is filmed here and I applaud the producers for this. \n\nBased on the episodes that I have seen so far, I hope that Private Eyes comes back for a second season. If it does, I know I will be watching.\n\nCheers!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4041,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-05-26","keywords":"hockey,body part in title,body part in series title,two word series title,two word title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000594/","name":"Jason Priestley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120797/","name":"Cindy Sampson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281284/","name":"Barry Flatman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150938/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2850421/","name":"Tim Kilby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259275/","name":"Shelley Eriksen"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Private Eyes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi576699417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Private Eyes"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

An insightful scientist sees The Bad Thing is going to happen, various foils keep him from warning people (often with sillier motivation than in this film), we get to know a bunch of average Joe characters who survive or do not survive the disaster. Earthquake movies, movies about made-up natural disasters that cannot happen, asteroid movies, even some nuclear holocaust films (like The Day After, unique in how many survive). It's a hackneyed formula, but it also works, and nothing else really does work as well for disaster plots. It was followed here.\n\nThe special effects were terrific in the day, and they still hold up very very well in 2012.\n\nFor a Hollywood film, the science was pretty good.

An insightful scientist sees The Bad Thing is going to happen, various foils keep him from warning people (often with sillier motivation than in this film), we get to know a bunch of average Joe characters who survive or do not survive the disaster. Earthquake movies, movies about made-up natural disasters that cannot happen, asteroid movies, even some nuclear holocaust films (like The Day After, unique in how many survive). It's a hackneyed formula, but it also works, and nothing else really does work as well for disaster plots. It was followed here.\n\nThe special effects were terrific in the day, and they still hold up very very well in 2012.\n\nFor a Hollywood film, the science was pretty good. I actually cringed back at the shots of Hawaii type basalt floes (just...no), and the ashfall cleared up nicely whenever they wanted a wide shot, which anyone in Yakima could tell you it really doesn't do, and the boat and drive-over-lava scenes were silly, and if you paddle a boat (through acid or not) with one hand, it's not going to go straight, and our heroes didn't need to cover their mouths in ashfall (meaning, IRL, the ash would turn to concrete in their lungs and they'd suffocate).

But I do try. Really dangerously funny stuff. I predict a popular backlash against this show, and have in fact seen some evidence of it already, simply because so many people are crazy about this show and cannot say enough good things about it. People are tiring of hearing that. But have patience, and don't try to read between the lines of fan praise. It is worth a watch. If only once. Three episodes in, there hasn't been a dud yet. These people will make a mint on First Season DVDs, and deserve to. The sharpest, wittiest, most wildly unpredictable writing now being done. --Makes other "well written" shows, like the CSIs, look as drab as Dragnet.\n\nThe bar has just been raised for those making series television. Most TV writers and producers will have to ignore the influence, though, because they won't be able to touch it.\n\nTen stars, times ten. ------------------- \n\nThe above review was written close to the beginning of the series. As we get as deep into the second season as we were in the first season where I wrote the above review, a revisit of the series is needed.\n\nBrie is decidedly less funny over time. Maybe more satisfying in a mean way, but less ha ha funny.

On her way home she is hit by another car. She goes to lawyer Ed Masry who spectacularly fails to win her any damages. Erin demands he gives her a job and he begrudgingly does. Doing some of his pro-bono work, Erin uncovers evidence that suggests that manufacturing firm PG&amp;E had poisoned the local water supply and lie to residents about the content. As she looks deeper she finds a legacy of illness and a small bit of research turns into a mammoth case.\n\nI don't know how much of this drama is factual and how much of it is changed to add to dramatic effect but regardless the story is involving, funny and moving. At the time there was a rash of 'environmental damage' legal films of which this is one of the more polished and classy. The film focuses as much on Erin as it does on the case and at times it risked failing as a legal drama/thriller. However it still grips as the facts pretty much speak for themselves  the film adds to this by creating a real sense of PG&amp;E as a monster without scruples or concern for the residents. As a result the events feel more powerful and involving. It feels slow at times, but if you're into it then it feels patient rather than slow and deliberate rather than laboured.\n\nThe biggest reason that the focus on Erin works is because Roberts really does very well giving her Erin a down to earth, trashy feel that could have been hammy or unbelievable (she is a multimillion pound actress after all), but it wasn't. Instead it was realistic and quite warm  where she could have been annoying. The grumpy Finney is also good value and seems natural in the role. Eckhart is almost too good to be true but gives a likable performance and is a winning non-distraction.\n\nThe film benefits from the style that Soderbergh brings to it. It glides with the grace that he brought to Ocean's 11 and has the rich colouring that parts of Traffic had. His direction really adds to the film and makes the sum feel a little greater that the parts put together.\n\nOverall this may not be the legal thriller that you hoped for and it may move a great deal slower that I thought a Hollywood film would, but it is worth it. The film is patient and worth baring with and Roberts is actually pretty good in the lead!

I guess we all want varying things from the dramas we watch - so long as the stories are character driven and allow for personal growth, and the main characters are likeable, I don't mind spending time with one or two people I would avoid in real life. Some of Callie and Mariana's new loft mates are a bit abrasive, and their workmates are ****s, but without conflict there would be no story. At the beginning of the pilot episode Callie and Mariana are in the same outfits and UHaul they were in at the very end of The Fosters.\n\nCierra Ramirez is exceptionally talented, has great comic timing (a gift), and never murdered a line in 5 seasons of The Fosters. She's the perfect person to play Mariana - set up by the writers with a propensity to stretch the truth or delude herself, and with no respect for anyone's secrets but her own. These flaws often are what keeps the stories moving. She makes up for these unforgivable traits by being fierce, whether protecting someone she cares about or cutting through other people's BS. Her breakthrough moments and her sense of fun are highlights, for me.\n\nNo, Callie has never seemed promiscuous or needy to me, but then I've never understood why anyone would expect most people to become attached, engaged and married happily ever after to only one person in a lifetime (unless the story is set in the 16th century or something). I'm in my 60s and happy for these characters to act their age - gosh, I might even learn something when one of them makes a mistake.\n\nThe pace of the storyline seems less frantic than The Fosters.\n\nAnother thing I don't understand is reviewers who whinge and moan about the show's "liberal" values. Well, duh! If they find it all so unbearable why on earth don't they watch something else? It's like smacking yourself in the eye so you can resent having hands.\n\nThe setting and sets for this series are just yummy, and the art theme is a bonus. The sequence in 01x05 involving the 1957 photo from Arkansas (see... no spoiler!) is typical of the occasional treats I've come to expect from these prducers. My only wish is that, as we are getting a lot of flashback sequences, writers would find a way to make this slightly less confusing.

I guess we all want varying things from the dramas we watch - so long as the stories are character driven and allow for personal growth, and the main characters are likeable, I don't mind spending time with one or two people I would avoid in real life. Some of Callie and Mariana's new loft mates are a bit abrasive, and their workmates are ****s, but without conflict there would be no story. At the beginning of the pilot episode Callie and Mariana are in the same outfits and UHaul they were in at the very end of The Fosters.\n\nCierra Ramirez is exceptionally talented, has great comic timing (a gift), and never murdered a line in 5 seasons of The Fosters. She's the perfect person to play Mariana - set up by the writers with a propensity to stretch the truth or delude herself, and with no respect for anyone's secrets but her own. These flaws often are what keeps the stories moving. She makes up for these unforgivable traits by being fierce, whether protecting someone she cares about or cutting through other people's BS. Her breakthrough moments and her sense of fun are highlights, for me.\n\nNo, Callie has never seemed promiscuous or needy to me, but then I've never understood why anyone would expect most people to become attached, engaged and married happily ever after to only one person in a lifetime (unless the story is set in the 16th century or something). I'm in my 60s and happy for these characters to act their age - gosh, I might even learn something when one of them makes a mistake.\n\nThe pace of the storyline seems less frantic than The Fosters.\n\nAnother thing I don't understand is reviewers who whinge and moan about the show's "liberal" values. Well, duh! If they find it all so unbearable why on earth don't they watch something else? It's like smacking yourself in the eye so you can resent having hands.\n\nThe setting and sets for this series are just yummy, and the art theme is a bonus. The sequence in 01x05 involving the 1957 photo from Arkansas (see... no spoiler!) is typical of the occasional treats I've come to expect from these prducers. My only wish is that, as we are getting a lot of flashback sequences, writers would find a way to make this slightly less confusing. As on The Fosters, I sometimes find myself wondering, not where, but when we are, in a story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5323,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-01-08","keywords":"live","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2314596/","name":"Maia Mitchell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2028116/","name":"Cierra Ramirez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5264136/","name":"Zuri Adele"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287645/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1401678/","name":"Bradley Bredeweg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425394/","name":"Joanna Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656739/","name":"Peter Paige"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Promo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi153598489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Callie and Mariana Foster move to Los Angeles and begin their lives as young adults.

These flaws often are what keeps the stories moving. She makes up for these unforgivable traits by being fierce, whether protecting someone she cares about or cutting through other people's BS. Her breakthrough moments and her sense of fun are highlights, for me.\n\nNo, Callie has never seemed promiscuous or needy to me, but then I've never understood why anyone would expect most people to become attached, engaged and married happily ever after to only one person in a lifetime (unless the story is set in the 16th century or something). I'm in my 60s and happy for these characters to act their age - gosh, I might even learn something when one of them makes a mistake.\n\nThe pace of the storyline seems less frantic than The Fosters.\n\nAnother thing I don't understand is reviewers who whinge and moan about the show's "liberal" values. Well, duh! If they find it all so unbearable why on earth don't they watch something else? It's like smacking yourself in the eye so you can resent having hands.\n\nThe setting and sets for this series are just yummy, and the art theme is a bonus. The sequence in 01x05 involving the 1957 photo from Arkansas (see... no spoiler!) is typical of the occasional treats I've come to expect from these prducers. My only wish is that, as we are getting a lot of flashback sequences, writers would find a way to make this slightly less confusing. As on The Fosters, I sometimes find myself wondering, not where, but when we are, in a story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5323,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-01-08","keywords":"live","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2314596/","name":"Maia Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2028116/","name":"Cierra Ramirez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5264136/","name":"Zuri Adele"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287645/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1401678/","name":"Bradley Bredeweg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425394/","name":"Joanna Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656739/","name":"Peter Paige"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Promo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi153598489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Callie and Mariana Foster move to Los Angeles and begin their lives as young adults.

When they are contracted in to get evidence of Roger Corwin stealing the kidnapped Eric Knox's voice recognition device.  The agents are successful but Knox turns out to have more sinister motives and the angels find themselves fighting to protect Charlie and Bosley.\n\nYet another in a line of film remake's of old TV shows, in the words of LL Cool J `yet another remake of an old TV show'.  However this just about succeeds for one simple reason  it never tries to take itself seriously. This works because it can be camp, silly and OTT because we know it's meant to be.  The plot is OK and has some reasonable twists but really the jokes and action move it along.  The silliness can get a bit much at times and is a little tiring.\n\nFor example we have far too many shots of the girls tossing their hair, and too many scenes that mean nothing.  Eg a high speed car chase ends on a bridge but it has no reason for happening and nothing happens as a result. The fights are very OTT and are very much a matrix rip off  they are only just saved by the tongue in cheek attitude of the film.  But even then they still silly.\n\nThe cast are OK but really they are just playing daft.  Rockwell is really good and Bill Murray saves the whole film by being really funny.

When they are contracted in to get evidence of Roger Corwin stealing the kidnapped Eric Knox's voice recognition device.  The agents are successful but Knox turns out to have more sinister motives and the angels find themselves fighting to protect Charlie and Bosley.\n\nYet another in a line of film remake's of old TV shows, in the words of LL Cool J `yet another remake of an old TV show'.  However this just about succeeds for one simple reason  it never tries to take itself seriously. This works because it can be camp, silly and OTT because we know it's meant to be.  The plot is OK and has some reasonable twists but really the jokes and action move it along.  The silliness can get a bit much at times and is a little tiring.\n\nFor example we have far too many shots of the girls tossing their hair, and too many scenes that mean nothing.  Eg a high speed car chase ends on a bridge but it has no reason for happening and nothing happens as a result. The fights are very OTT and are very much a matrix rip off  they are only just saved by the tongue in cheek attitude of the film.  But even then they still silly.\n\nThe cast are OK but really they are just playing daft.  Rockwell is really good and Bill Murray saves the whole film by being really funny.  Tom Green is in it because his girlfriend felt sorry for him and wanted him to be in a film that got shown in a cinema outside of the US, however his character is stupid and pointless.  Wilson is good and LL Cool J makes a good cameo, but Tim Curry has been better.\n\nOverall it's enjoyable if you're in the mood for silly popcorn trash.

This blockbuster is an acceptable adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to other prior renditions . The title is paraphrased from a Winston Churchill speech; "Why, you can take the most gallant sailor, the most intrepid airman or the most audacious soldier, put them at a table together - what do you get? The sum of their fears." It deals with CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) along with a ranking member (Morgan Freeman) of Presidential administration must thwart the plans of a terrorist faction that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia's newly elected president by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game in Baltimore. As there are 27,000 Nuclear Weapons and One Is Missing . Now Ryan goes back in action for the most vital assignment of his life : to save the President (James Cromwell) and the nation .\n\nStirring outing filled with emotion , suspense , chills , twisted intrigue and extraordinary nail-biting action scenes . This film is a prequel to the others in the Jack Ryan series . The 'Harrison Ford' films are direct follow-ups to The hunt for Red October (1990) despite the recast of Alec Baldwin's role . Nevertheless, in this film we see Jack Ryan meet John Clark, something which also happens in Clear and present danger (1994) . Therefore this film might be best understood as a reboot of the Jack Ryan series . Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne . However , the filmmaker changed the villains from Islamic extremists , in the novel , to Neo-Nazis ; this was done because prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks, he did not believe Arab terrorists could plausibly accomplish all that was necessary for the plot to work on film . Good production design , in fact , the CIA scenes were filmed at the actual CIA headquarters ; this was one of the times the CIA had ever done such a thing . And this was the first American film unit to enter the Kremlin , though Red Heat (1988) was the first American unit to film in Moscow . The spectacular "Super Bowl" scene takes place in Baltimore , the two teams playing in the game are portrayed by the Toronto Argonauts and the Montreal Alouettes . Real U. S. Marines along with two Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters were used for the sequence of rescuing Fowler from the wrecked motorcade . The picture has a very good support cast who gives excellent performances such as James Cromwell as President Fowler , Bruce McGill as National Security Adviser , John Beasley as General Lasseter , Philip Baker Hall as Defense Secretary , Joseph Sommer as Senator , Michael Byrne , Liev Schreiber , Alan Bates , Sven-Ole Thorsen , Ron Rifkin , Colm Feore and special mention to Ciaran Hinds as Russia President . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by maestro veteran Jerry Goldsmith . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by John Lindley .

This blockbuster is an acceptable adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to other prior renditions . The title is paraphrased from a Winston Churchill speech; "Why, you can take the most gallant sailor, the most intrepid airman or the most audacious soldier, put them at a table together - what do you get? The sum of their fears." It deals with CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) along with a ranking member (Morgan Freeman) of Presidential administration must thwart the plans of a terrorist faction that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia's newly elected president by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game in Baltimore. As there are 27,000 Nuclear Weapons and One Is Missing . Now Ryan goes back in action for the most vital assignment of his life : to save the President (James Cromwell) and the nation .\n\nStirring outing filled with emotion , suspense , chills , twisted intrigue and extraordinary nail-biting action scenes . This film is a prequel to the others in the Jack Ryan series . The 'Harrison Ford' films are direct follow-ups to The hunt for Red October (1990) despite the recast of Alec Baldwin's role . Nevertheless, in this film we see Jack Ryan meet John Clark, something which also happens in Clear and present danger (1994) . Therefore this film might be best understood as a reboot of the Jack Ryan series . Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne . However , the filmmaker changed the villains from Islamic extremists , in the novel , to Neo-Nazis ; this was done because prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks, he did not believe Arab terrorists could plausibly accomplish all that was necessary for the plot to work on film . Good production design , in fact , the CIA scenes were filmed at the actual CIA headquarters ; this was one of the times the CIA had ever done such a thing . And this was the first American film unit to enter the Kremlin , though Red Heat (1988) was the first American unit to film in Moscow . The spectacular "Super Bowl" scene takes place in Baltimore , the two teams playing in the game are portrayed by the Toronto Argonauts and the Montreal Alouettes . Real U. S. Marines along with two Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters were used for the sequence of rescuing Fowler from the wrecked motorcade . The picture has a very good support cast who gives excellent performances such as James Cromwell as President Fowler , Bruce McGill as National Security Adviser , John Beasley as General Lasseter , Philip Baker Hall as Defense Secretary , Joseph Sommer as Senator , Michael Byrne , Liev Schreiber , Alan Bates , Sven-Ole Thorsen , Ron Rifkin , Colm Feore and special mention to Ciaran Hinds as Russia President . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by maestro veteran Jerry Goldsmith . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by John Lindley . The picture is well directed by Phil Alden Robinson , though Philip Noyce, director of previous entries, was offered to direct but turned it down and Wolfgang Petersen was also offered the chance to direct but declined.\n\nThis blockbuster is an entertaining adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to ¨The hunt for Red October¨ by John MacTiernan with Alec Balwin and Sean Connery , followed by ¨Patriot games¨ (1992) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and again ¨Clear and present danger¨(1994) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford and Anne Archer .

Mike Ditka, as an actor--- he's a great football coach.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37204,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-05-13","keywords":"boy wears eyeglasses,singing,soccer,suburb,slapstick comedy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002071/","name":"Will Ferrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245888/","name":"Jesse Dylan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037759/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1080144/","name":"Leo Benvenuti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748874/","name":"Steve Rudnick"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done. \n\nOnce again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over.

First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice.

Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people.

When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out.

One of his favourite signature technique he use repeatedly was using a single wide lens shooting a subject from far then instantly turn to a close up subject cruising by without proper follow focus or basic composition in photography.

And all the while these happening he also added artificial violent shakes and vibration to the camera, its like u watching the movie on a Symbian horse vibrator turn to max!\n\nGosh!! i miss jj abram so much!!! after seeing the fraud call Justin lin, and the choice of music was horrible.\n\nTo cut it short, the script are rush, with tons of plot holes, not mystery no charm and totally lazy camera works by a unimaginative immature sorry excuse name Justin Lin."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-07-21","keywords":"star trek,third part,alien,stranded,survivor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi354465561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704270/","name":"Zachary Quinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881631/","name":"Karl Urban"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510912/","name":"Justin Lin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0708328/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0670408/","name":"Simon Pegg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1136647/","name":"Doug Jung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of his favourite signature technique he use repeatedly was using a single wide lens shooting a subject from far then instantly turn to a close up subject cruising by without proper follow focus or basic composition in photography. This cause the next subject he follows on end up appear blurry and cover 70% of the scene. One good example is near the climax scene where the shooting a person running from a distant then suddenly turn the camera into Kirk on a bike passing by all this without zooming out, correcting the focus or swap to a different camera, angle or different lens. And all the while these happening he also added artificial violent shakes and vibration to the camera, its like u watching the movie on a Symbian horse vibrator turn to max!\n\nGosh!! i miss jj abram so much!!! after seeing the fraud call Justin lin, and the choice of music was horrible.\n\nTo cut it short, the script are rush, with tons of plot holes, not mystery no charm and totally lazy camera works by a unimaginative immature sorry excuse name Justin Lin.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-07-21","keywords":"star trek,third part,alien,stranded,survivor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi354465561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704270/","name":"Zachary Quinto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881631/","name":"Karl Urban"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510912/","name":"Justin Lin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0708328/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0670408/","name":"Simon Pegg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1136647/","name":"Doug Jung","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

No kad je odvede na Joeyjevu zabavu na krovu kako bi upoznala zvijezde Joeyjeve sapunice "Naši najbolji dani", ona ga zastraši svojim dojmljivim popisom bivših momaka. U međuvremenu Rachel i pijana Monica blesavo se ponašaju na okupljanju progoneći zgodne glumce. A Chandler prisustvuje uznemirujućoj ženskoj monodrami.odgovora. No dok traže ispunjenje, također paze jedni na druge u ovo uzbudljivo vrijeme kad im se čini da je sve moguće - dok god imaju prijatelje.</desc>

Knowing that Id recommend this for anyone looking to watch a great movie","reviewBody":"Ya RomComs are something I avoid at all costs. Theyre always the same and never ever anything that would play out in real life so why give you or your partner unrealistic expectations watching something that is just going to set you up for failure.. This movie SPONTANOUSly turned out to be something completely unexpected - REALLY Good and really funny. The romance part is underplayed and mostly the setup as an after thought for the perfectly timed witty one liners that are delivered spot on with real chemistry you can feel between the main actors. The movie is just a take on the traditional coming of age story and how everything when youre young seems like the end or the beginning of the world and with each death of a young persons dream life its never the end but just the transition to another dream of how life will play out..

The romance part is underplayed and mostly the setup as an after thought for the perfectly timed witty one liners that are delivered spot on with real chemistry you can feel between the main actors. The movie is just a take on the traditional coming of age story and how everything when youre young seems like the end or the beginning of the world and with each death of a young persons dream life its never the end but just the transition to another dream of how life will play out..

The movie does not need one, which helps it to maintain its quality as not just a Bond movie, but a high quality action movie that can stand on its own.  You will even find (gasp!) . . . character building!  There is actually dialogue between Q and Bond, instead of just a briefing and some commands.

The dialogue is just soooo simplistic and often demeaning to both the audience and the actors.\n\nDirection: Above average - considering the film is 'mainly' CGI - and getting both the actors and crew to stay on point must have been a pita - they did an excellent job.\n\nFurther on the plus side - there's a few moments of 'action/suspense', one moment of actual 'comedy' and over an hour and half of decent CGI... but that's it.\n\nAs an adult, I ploughed through this movie and nearly sobbed with relief when it ended - hopefully, my sacrifice will be taken into consideration if you think about watching this rubbish... but, if you have kids (9-11) then they're going to really enjoy it !!\n\nNote: I changed both my rating as an adult from a: 3 to (as a grandparent) a: 6 simply based upon my grandkids reaction to the film.

Sinister mystery of Hogwarts.","reviewBody":""... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath." Book Review, December 18, 2000\n\nThe second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.\n\nThe magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.\n\nIn "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.\n\nCharacters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.\n\n"I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us." - "Certainly." Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.\n\nRon Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.\n\nHermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.\n\n"We are badly influenced by it." Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.\n\n"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":580877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"invisibility cloak,sequel,wizard,basilisk,killing a monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1705771289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.\n\nIn "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.\n\nCharacters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.\n\n"I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us." - "Certainly." Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.\n\nRon Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.\n\nHermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.\n\n"We are badly influenced by it." Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.\n\n"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":580877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"invisibility cloak,sequel,wizard,basilisk,killing a monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1705771289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever  I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending.

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever  I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending. If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' "Oscar" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Think about this - Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years, and his earliest release date is 2039. Charles Manson has been getting regular parole hearings since the 1990s. Who is more dangerous? A better question is who is more dangerous to the plutocracy. \n\nThe whole story is basically done in flashback after Madoff is incarcerated and is being interviewed by a reporter. This film takes the approach of assuming that the wife and sons knew nothing until Bernie told them right before he was arrested. If there is anything the Bernie Madoff story would teach you, it is "Don't steal from the very rich". The movie emphasized all of the little people who lost everything to the Ponzi scheme, but there were enough people with enough money left over - as in hundreds of millions - that they could hire attorneys and even claw back money from people who withdrew all of their money before Bernie went bust, even though they knew nothing of the scheme. Compare that to what happened to the banksters who swindled the entire nation - which was absolutely nothing, or Enron, where the Bush administration had to practically be shamed into prosecuting the executives who swindled investors. To date about 70% of the money Bernie Madoff swindled has been recovered, with "small" investors - those that invested less than a million - being made completely whole.\n\nAnyways, back to "The Wizard", which doesn't mention any of this. DeNiro was terrific as a guy who decided to keep his swindling secret to himself - and one smarmy associate played by Hank Azaria. Michelle Pfeiffer as Ruth Madoff almost stole the show from DeNiro as a woman who can't deal with being ostracized and hated for something she had nothing to do with. She wonders aloud how she got to be almost 70 and never learned to do anything for herself. De Niro's Madoff is shown as being able to compartmentalize how he is stealing from investors, many of whom are family and friends, encouraging those at the end to put in huge amounts of money to keep the scheme afloat in the wake of the 2008 crash, which is ultimately what did him in, and somehow sees taking what is left of his ill gotten gains and distributing it to his family and "a few loyal employees" before he turns himself in as "noblesse oblige" not just more theft, which it was.\n\nHints to Madoff's personality are in the little scenes. He is very stoic about being the world's biggest and most brazen thief caught to date, but he does get animated about a dirty dish and the way lobster is served at a society dinner he is hosting. \n\nThere is one particularly odd scene for Turner Classic Movie fans. At one point, while Bernie is under house arrest, Bernie and his wife decide to commit suicide in "a nice way" using Ambien and a bunch of other pharmaceuticals they have around the house. It doesn't work - they wake up the next morning. But as they lay in bed expecting to die, who pops up on the TV screen they are watching but the recently deceased Robert Osborne and TCM with him introducing Judy Garland singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". What an odd touch. I didn't even think anybody at HBO even knew that TCM existed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Think about this - Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years, and his earliest release date is 2039. Charles Manson has been getting regular parole hearings since the 1990s. Who is more dangerous? A better question is who is more dangerous to the plutocracy. \n\nThe whole story is basically done in flashback after Madoff is incarcerated and is being interviewed by a reporter. This film takes the approach of assuming that the wife and sons knew nothing until Bernie told them right before he was arrested. If there is anything the Bernie Madoff story would teach you, it is "Don't steal from the very rich". The movie emphasized all of the little people who lost everything to the Ponzi scheme, but there were enough people with enough money left over - as in hundreds of millions - that they could hire attorneys and even claw back money from people who withdrew all of their money before Bernie went bust, even though they knew nothing of the scheme. Compare that to what happened to the banksters who swindled the entire nation - which was absolutely nothing, or Enron, where the Bush administration had to practically be shamed into prosecuting the executives who swindled investors. To date about 70% of the money Bernie Madoff swindled has been recovered, with "small" investors - those that invested less than a million - being made completely whole.\n\nAnyways, back to "The Wizard", which doesn't mention any of this. DeNiro was terrific as a guy who decided to keep his swindling secret to himself - and one smarmy associate played by Hank Azaria. Michelle Pfeiffer as Ruth Madoff almost stole the show from DeNiro as a woman who can't deal with being ostracized and hated for something she had nothing to do with. She wonders aloud how she got to be almost 70 and never learned to do anything for herself. De Niro's Madoff is shown as being able to compartmentalize how he is stealing from investors, many of whom are family and friends, encouraging those at the end to put in huge amounts of money to keep the scheme afloat in the wake of the 2008 crash, which is ultimately what did him in, and somehow sees taking what is left of his ill gotten gains and distributing it to his family and "a few loyal employees" before he turns himself in as "noblesse oblige" not just more theft, which it was.\n\nHints to Madoff's personality are in the little scenes. He is very stoic about being the world's biggest and most brazen thief caught to date, but he does get animated about a dirty dish and the way lobster is served at a society dinner he is hosting. \n\nThere is one particularly odd scene for Turner Classic Movie fans. At one point, while Bernie is under house arrest, Bernie and his wife decide to commit suicide in "a nice way" using Ambien and a bunch of other pharmaceuticals they have around the house. It doesn't work - they wake up the next morning. But as they lay in bed expecting to die, who pops up on the TV screen they are watching but the recently deceased Robert Osborne and TCM with him introducing Judy Garland singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". What an odd touch. I didn't even think anybody at HBO even knew that TCM existed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

No kad je odvede na Joeyjevu zabavu na krovu kako bi upoznala zvijezde Joeyjeve sapunice "Naši najbolji dani", ona ga zastraši svojim dojmljivim popisom bivših momaka. U međuvremenu Rachel i pijana Monica blesavo se ponašaju na okupljanju progoneći zgodne glumce. A Chandler prisustvuje uznemirujućoj ženskoj monodrami.odgovora.

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever  I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending. If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' "Oscar" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' "Oscar" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Think about this - Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years, and his earliest release date is 2039. Charles Manson has been getting regular parole hearings since the 1990s. Who is more dangerous? A better question is who is more dangerous to the plutocracy. \n\nThe whole story is basically done in flashback after Madoff is incarcerated and is being interviewed by a reporter. This film takes the approach of assuming that the wife and sons knew nothing until Bernie told them right before he was arrested. If there is anything the Bernie Madoff story would teach you, it is "Don't steal from the very rich". The movie emphasized all of the little people who lost everything to the Ponzi scheme, but there were enough people with enough money left over - as in hundreds of millions - that they could hire attorneys and even claw back money from people who withdrew all of their money before Bernie went bust, even though they knew nothing of the scheme. Compare that to what happened to the banksters who swindled the entire nation - which was absolutely nothing, or Enron, where the Bush administration had to practically be shamed into prosecuting the executives who swindled investors. To date about 70% of the money Bernie Madoff swindled has been recovered, with "small" investors - those that invested less than a million - being made completely whole.\n\nAnyways, back to "The Wizard", which doesn't mention any of this. DeNiro was terrific as a guy who decided to keep his swindling secret to himself - and one smarmy associate played by Hank Azaria. Michelle Pfeiffer as Ruth Madoff almost stole the show from DeNiro as a woman who can't deal with being ostracized and hated for something she had nothing to do with. She wonders aloud how she got to be almost 70 and never learned to do anything for herself. De Niro's Madoff is shown as being able to compartmentalize how he is stealing from investors, many of whom are family and friends, encouraging those at the end to put in huge amounts of money to keep the scheme afloat in the wake of the 2008 crash, which is ultimately what did him in, and somehow sees taking what is left of his ill gotten gains and distributing it to his family and "a few loyal employees" before he turns himself in as "noblesse oblige" not just more theft, which it was.\n\nHints to Madoff's personality are in the little scenes. He is very stoic about being the world's biggest and most brazen thief caught to date, but he does get animated about a dirty dish and the way lobster is served at a society dinner he is hosting. \n\nThere is one particularly odd scene for Turner Classic Movie fans. At one point, while Bernie is under house arrest, Bernie and his wife decide to commit suicide in "a nice way" using Ambien and a bunch of other pharmaceuticals they have around the house. It doesn't work - they wake up the next morning. But as they lay in bed expecting to die, who pops up on the TV screen they are watching but the recently deceased Robert Osborne and TCM with him introducing Judy Garland singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas".

As the movie opens, we get to know Mona, as she is making her way to work. Mona is a Norwegian diplomat meeting in London with the Palestine Minister of Finance, to convince him to take a leap of faith and open a "back channel" for secret negotiations with Israel. Mona's husband meanwhile is convincing the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister to do the same. In January of 1993, the parties arrive in Oslo... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the Tony Award-winning stage play of the same name. The movie is directed by Tony Award-winning director Bartlett Sher, now venturing out into the movies.

As the movie opens, we get to know Mona, as she is making her way to work. Mona is a Norwegian diplomat meeting in London with the Palestine Minister of Finance, to convince him to take a leap of faith and open a "back channel" for secret negotiations with Israel. Mona's husband meanwhile is convincing the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister to do the same. In January of 1993, the parties arrive in Oslo... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the Tony Award-winning stage play of the same name. The movie is directed by Tony Award-winning director Bartlett Sher, now venturing out into the movies.

The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.\n\nLike some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.\n\nEspecially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.\n\nAs enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.\n\nHowever, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.\n\nVaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.\n\nAction-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.\n\nRegarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.\n\nOne has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.\n\nIn conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":291095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"fighting,one against many,man cut in half,spy,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi734968089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When their headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, the Kingsman's journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the US.
