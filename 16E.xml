For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.\n\nAnd the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.\n\nThe script is witty and full of dark humour, "I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you.", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.\n\nA special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).\n\nFor once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.\n\nAn 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":297702,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Horror"],"datePublished":"1996-01-19","keywords":"stripper,sex offender,held hostage,u.s. mexico border,priest","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"From Dusk Till Dawn","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3052320281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVjZDY5ODAtZDg2Ny00ZDJlLTk2YzgtNmEzMjZiOWFkYmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVjZDY5ODAtZDg2Ny00ZDJlLTk2YzgtNmEzMjZiOWFkYmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for From Dusk Till Dawn"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000172/","name":"Harvey Keitel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000496/","name":"Juliette Lewis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019267/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0870559/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476071/","name":"Robert Kurtzman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Assisted by an abnormally-skilled gang of other military victims, Bazil endeavours to bring down the two perpetrators and strike a damaging blow at the entire industry.\n\nThe aforementioned plot could potentially deliver a grim and bloodthirsty heist thriller, but French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has other intentions. The opening scene in which the little boy Bazil (here played by the young Noé Boon) witnesses his father being blown to pieces amongst the familiar scenery of sandy deserts and Arab costumes, and the following event of Bazil being accidentally shot in the head by a rogue army officer, carry some suspense and sorrow. These serve as a succinct and sufficiently grave acknowledgement of the atrocities of terrorism, yet thankfully Jeunet has the intelligence and frivolity to drop the solemnity at this point, avoiding overstatement of the point and unleashing riches of wonderfully liberating and delightfully unpretentious entertainment.\n\nBazil's accomplices, or rather, kind and caring companions, are an extremely lovable and splendidly colourful bunch of very uncomplicated characters. Living in a cosy makeshift home, they support each other using their special talents, which range from the remarkable innovation of an expert inventor (a charming Michel Crémadès) to the incredible flexibility of a charismatic contortionist (Julie Ferrier's infectious spunk matches perfectly with Dany Boon's priceless quirks). Their plans to foil the two villains are extremely creative and utterly unexpected, providing most of the film's subtle and beautifully simplistic humour.\n\nAlthough the film's simplicity does comes at a cost, dragging it far away from Oscar-worthy greatness. It also results in a slight lag in the middle, where its lack of depth truly takes its toll after the initial burst of exuberance momentarily ceases to resonate. However, this barren stretch of reel precedes and is redeemed by the ultimate serving of ingenious wit and hilarity.\n\nAll in all a sumptuous treat for everyone, proving just as effective across the language barriers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29660,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-10-28","keywords":"bullet,revenge,contortionist,gag humor,crazy humor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Micmacs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2588476441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcxMDMwMTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1MzAzMw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcxMDMwMTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1MzAzMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Released from the hospital with a bullet lodged in his brain, Bazil (Boon) is taken in by a crew of junkyard dealers who help him plot his revenge against weapons manufacturers.

Lively musical score by Randy Edelman , adding hard rock, heavy metal and disco-music. The film is produced with high budget by Neal H. Moritz, an action movies producer and usual of Rob Cohen movies. Cohen is a nice director of hits, such as ¨Stealth, Fast and furious, Daylight, Skulls, Dragonheart¨ among others. It's followed by an inferior sequel starred by Ice Cube and again with Samuel L Jackson and directed by Lee Tamahori.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":176304,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-09-11","keywords":"time bomb,kidnapping,tattoo on torso,adventure hero,physical skill","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"xXx","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi451084569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjc0OGItNWY2ZS00ZmRjLTlhOTEtNmI1MTFjZDk3ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjc0OGItNWY2ZS00ZmRjLTlhOTEtNmI1MTFjZDk3ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004874/","name":"Vin Diesel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000782/","name":"Asia Argento","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003418/","name":"Rob Cohen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929186/","name":"Rich Wilkes"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I love David Fincher, and he does not disappoint in terms of direction.  In general, it's full of great visuals.  The opening sequence and a couple other scenes are an incredible testament to the realistic computer graphics available today.  Color, focus, angle, and a myriad of other elements also make this film stimulating visually.  All the actors do their parts justice; Jodie Foster is convincing, the daughter pulls off apathy and so forth, Whitaker comes across as a reluctant man forced by circumstance, and there's a great (albeit small) performance by Cop #1.\n\nHowever, good acting and good direction do not make this film.  The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half. On a positive note, there is a great deal of dead-on comedy woven into the lulls; but afterwards it almost feels forced.  Also, gore was added to the film for no apparent reason.  To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution.

I love David Fincher, and he does not disappoint in terms of direction.  In general, it's full of great visuals.  The opening sequence and a couple other scenes are an incredible testament to the realistic computer graphics available today.  Color, focus, angle, and a myriad of other elements also make this film stimulating visually.  All the actors do their parts justice; Jodie Foster is convincing, the daughter pulls off apathy and so forth, Whitaker comes across as a reluctant man forced by circumstance, and there's a great (albeit small) performance by Cop #1.\n\nHowever, good acting and good direction do not make this film.  The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half. On a positive note, there is a great deal of dead-on comedy woven into the lulls; but afterwards it almost feels forced.  Also, gore was added to the film for no apparent reason.  To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution.  To what degree Koepp deserves the blame for these mismatched, unpleasant elements I do not know, but in my opinion he hasn't written a great script since Jurassic Park, which had all the comedy of Panic Room, but must have stolen the suspense from the second half.\n\nOverall, I'd give this movie 2 out of 5.

Assisted by an abnormally-skilled gang of other military victims, Bazil endeavours to bring down the two perpetrators and strike a damaging blow at the entire industry.\n\nThe aforementioned plot could potentially deliver a grim and bloodthirsty heist thriller, but French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has other intentions. The opening scene in which the little boy Bazil (here played by the young Noé Boon) witnesses his father being blown to pieces amongst the familiar scenery of sandy deserts and Arab costumes, and the following event of Bazil being accidentally shot in the head by a rogue army officer, carry some suspense and sorrow. These serve as a succinct and sufficiently grave acknowledgement of the atrocities of terrorism, yet thankfully Jeunet has the intelligence and frivolity to drop the solemnity at this point, avoiding overstatement of the point and unleashing riches of wonderfully liberating and delightfully unpretentious entertainment.\n\nBazil's accomplices, or rather, kind and caring companions, are an extremely lovable and splendidly colourful bunch of very uncomplicated characters. Living in a cosy makeshift home, they support each other using their special talents, which range from the remarkable innovation of an expert inventor (a charming Michel Crémadès) to the incredible flexibility of a charismatic contortionist (Julie Ferrier's infectious spunk matches perfectly with Dany Boon's priceless quirks). Their plans to foil the two villains are extremely creative and utterly unexpected, providing most of the film's subtle and beautifully simplistic humour.\n\nAlthough the film's simplicity does comes at a cost, dragging it far away from Oscar-worthy greatness. It also results in a slight lag in the middle, where its lack of depth truly takes its toll after the initial burst of exuberance momentarily ceases to resonate. However, this barren stretch of reel precedes and is redeemed by the ultimate serving of ingenious wit and hilarity.\n\nAll in all a sumptuous treat for everyone, proving just as effective across the language barriers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29660,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-10-28","keywords":"bullet,revenge,contortionist,gag humor,crazy humor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Micmacs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2588476441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcxMDMwMTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1MzAzMw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcxMDMwMTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1MzAzMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Released from the hospital with a bullet lodged in his brain, Bazil (Boon) is taken in by a crew of junkyard dealers who help him plot his revenge against weapons manufacturers.

Their plans to foil the two villains are extremely creative and utterly unexpected, providing most of the film's subtle and beautifully simplistic humour.\n\nAlthough the film's simplicity does comes at a cost, dragging it far away from Oscar-worthy greatness. It also results in a slight lag in the middle, where its lack of depth truly takes its toll after the initial burst of exuberance momentarily ceases to resonate. However, this barren stretch of reel precedes and is redeemed by the ultimate serving of ingenious wit and hilarity.\n\nAll in all a sumptuous treat for everyone, proving just as effective across the language barriers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29660,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-10-28","keywords":"bullet,revenge,contortionist,gag humor,crazy humor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Micmacs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2588476441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcxMDMwMTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1MzAzMw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcxMDMwMTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1MzAzMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Released from the hospital with a bullet lodged in his brain, Bazil (Boon) is taken in by a crew of junkyard dealers who help him plot his revenge against weapons manufacturers.

Last year, the highlight of the festival for me was American Beauty.  This year, it would have to be (so far) Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".\n\nBeing of Asian descent, I've seen my share of wu xia genre movies to last me a life time.  However, most of them are so centred on the fighting, that they forget the rest of the elements that are involed.  The movie turns into one long scripted fighting scene with maybe a slight hint of story. Crouching Tiger, on the other hand realizes these issues, and builds these oh-so entertaining action sequences into an epic with typical asian themes such as true love and honour.\n\nBeing an epic, one would expect the usual long takes and establishing shots, and boy does it ever look beautiful.  Traversing through a myriad of regions spanning the lengh of China (from the deserts to bamboo forests, to mountains high in the clouds), the film soley based on its asthetic properties is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour.  And then there's the cinemetography.  Wow!  The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous.  If your jaw dropped when you saw Rome and its coliseum in Gladiator, wait until you see ancient Beijing recreated on the screen!\n\nOkay, so it's a good looking movie.  What about the story?  The complexity of the plot is rather sparse, probably reminiscent of epics such as Braveheart or Gladiator, which is by no means a bad thing.  Although both Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeo did have major parts, this movie belongs mostly to Zhang Ziyi who IMHO did an amazing job playing a very complex role (one which required her to represent nobily as a princess, naivness, as well as show inner strength).  Mainly concentrating on her unwillingness to give in to the ideals of an arranged marriage, the decently written script adds a story of an old warrior trying to retire and a 300+ year old sword.\n\nAll in all, this film blends story, well choreographed action, and a stylistic eye to create a mythilogical piece that not only represents the wu xia genre justly by doing it well, but also contributes to raising the quality of filmmaking usually applied in the making of a similar type of film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260429,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All elements of film making seemed to work, for me. I like realism in films and the sense of isolation in the Australian outback was palpable. After viewing the trailer for Wolf Creek 2 I thought that the film might fall into the Hollywood category. What I was hoping for was another gem.\n\nJohn Jarratt returns as serial killer Mick Taylor. He delivers another strong performance. His laugh and hoarse, Aussie voice never falter. He gets totally into character and runs the show. He has too much screen time, however, to make him as scary as he should be. The viewer is given too much knowledge of his whereabouts, I felt.\n\nThe actors who play the tourists are good, notably Ryan Corr, playing well-educated British traveler, Paul. The film doesn't provide much insight into his character which might be the reason why I had little empathy for him, or any of Mick's victims in this film. Towards the end I was routing for the tourists solely because as the viewer we have witnessed the hell their put through. For whatever reason, I really liked the characters in the first film and it was hard to watch them meet their fate.\n\nThe sense of isolation is there but doesn't have the same effect as it did in the first film, probably because there are a few more characters in this film, and other devices used to create action, which made the film appear less chilling and more thrilling.\n\nI liked that McLean used subtitles for the German couple because I wasn't expecting it. Of course English isn't always going to be a tourists first language and they're not going to speak it for our benefit. Fret not, once the screaming begins you don't have to do a lot of reading.\n\nSome parts of the film felt a little odd to me at first, and there are a couple of comical sequences. I took it in the movie's stride. Perhaps that was writer number 2, Aaron Sterns, input. I didn't mind. There was enough Mick Taylor sadism to pull me back to the horror film I went in to watch. The setting at the end was a little disappointing because it felt too orchestrated and unlike Mick Taylor. It felt more like a scene from 'Hostel'. \n\nThe first film is a rare beauty, and Wolf Creek 2 is a good sequel - nothing more, nothing less IMO.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-02-20","keywords":"characters murdered one by one,psychopathic murderer,slasher murderer,tourist,crime spree","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wolf Creek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1774303769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThhYzk2NjAtOTliNy00OThlLTlkMjItZWZjZTNmMjRkZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Wolf Creek 2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418877/","name":"John Jarratt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1507708/","name":"Ryan Corr"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590140/","name":"Shannon Ashlyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036887/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048683/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572562/","name":"Greg McLean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1846103/","name":"Aaron Sterns"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This isn't a documentary. I was a JAG and that TV show wasn't even close to being accurate. But it WAS entertaining. And, like this show, it captures the spirit and fellowship of a tight military team. Whoever these folks are dissing the show I have news for you...women play vital roles in our armed services. The contribution here is fairly accurate from what I understand. This is entertaining, it's patriotic and it honors the men and women in the front lines of the war on terror.

It was a phenomenal achievement in the horror genre so of coarse a sequel was just around the corner. The most common rule with movies is that sequels are terrible and while that is normally always true, that isn't the case with SCREAM 2. It should be noted that SCREAM 2 came out just a year after the original SCREAM. Most often when sequels come out a year after their predecessor, they turn out to be pretty bad (CHILD'S PLAY 3 for example). SCREAM 2, while not as good as SCREAM, manages to be an effective and well made sequel that surprisingly is just as clever as the first one and it contains the same kind of great dialogue the first one had as well. It helps that SCREAM 2 has most of the same cast members as the first one too. I think it's safe to say that SCREAM 2 was one of the better sequels of the 1990s. I'm giving it 7/10.

It was a phenomenal achievement in the horror genre so of coarse a sequel was just around the corner. The most common rule with movies is that sequels are terrible and while that is normally always true, that isn't the case with SCREAM 2. It should be noted that SCREAM 2 came out just a year after the original SCREAM. Most often when sequels come out a year after their predecessor, they turn out to be pretty bad (CHILD'S PLAY 3 for example). SCREAM 2, while not as good as SCREAM, manages to be an effective and well made sequel that surprisingly is just as clever as the first one and it contains the same kind of great dialogue the first one had as well. It helps that SCREAM 2 has most of the same cast members as the first one too. I think it's safe to say that SCREAM 2 was one of the better sequels of the 1990s. I'm giving it 7/10. Recommended for fans of horror.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"villain,satire,self referential,murder spree,serial murder","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Scream 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi919641625","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWUwYzkxMjMtNjlmMy00M2Q3LTgwYWYtMWVhNTRiZjk2YWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWUwYzkxMjMtNjlmMy00M2Q3LTgwYWYtMWVhNTRiZjk2YWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000117/","name":"Neve Campbell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001073/","name":"Courteney Cox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000274/","name":"David Arquette"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000127/","name":"Wes Craven"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010901/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013899/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0932078/","name":"Kevin Williamson"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Andrey felt in disgrace with the Communist Party thirty years ago for protecting the Jewish musicians and was no longer allowed to conduct an orchestra. One night, Andrey reads a just-received fax while cleaning the office of the Bolshoi's director Leonid Vinichenko (Valentin Teodosiu) and he hides the document. He learns that the Châtelet Theater in Paris has just invited the Bolshoi Orchestra to perform a concert in Paris within two weeks. Andrey shows the fax to his friend and musician Aleksandr 'Sasha' Abramovich Grosman (Dimitri Nazarov) that drives an ambulance and he decides to reunite fifty-five former musicians of Bolshoi to travel to Paris and perform The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35, by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He invites the Communist leader and former KGB Ivan Gavrilov (Valeri Barinov) to manage the orchestra and he requests the solo of the prominent musician Anne- Marie Jacquet (Mélanie Laurent) and to stay in Paris for three days. \n\nWhen they arrive in Paris, Andrey meets Anne-Marie while the musicians wander in the city, partying and raising money. The unprofessionalism of the Russian musicians forces Anne-Marie to call off the concert; but Sasha convinces her to come to the theater. Meanwhile Andrey grieves the incident with the violinist Lea thirty years ago and hides a secret from Anne-Marie. What is the connection between Andrey and Anne-Marie?\n\n"Le Concert" is a film not only for movie lovers, but mainly for music lovers. This dramatic comedy tells an adorable bitter-sweet story about losses and second chance in life through music, or better, the wonderful and awesome Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. \n\nThe director Radu Mihaileanu, from "Train de Vie", once again plays with tragic situations, using a witty screenplay with charismatic characters and making laugh and cry out of joy. I have seen the sequence of the concert at least eight consecutive times, full of emotion and with tears in my eyes. This is one of the most beautiful and touching climax I have ever seen in a film.\n\nThe cast is fantastic and Mélanie Laurent is awesome, giving credibility to her violin solo during the presentation. Last but not the least, this film should have been at least nominated to the Oscar. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "O Concerto" ("The Concert" – not available on DVD or Blu-Ray)\n\nNote: On 10 August 2011, I saw this outstanding film again on DVD.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17769,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2009-11-04","keywords":"russian,france,orchestra,concert,gypsy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Concert","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2727544345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjg4NTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5NTg4MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjg4NTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5NTg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"During the communist era, AndreÃ¯ Filipov was fired as the conductor of Moscow's Bolshoi Orchestra for refusing to fire all Jewish performers.

Julianne Moore is excellent and deserving of the acclaim she's received for this role, as well as Quaid in the supporting role. The thing I think most people missed (or haven't made much comment on) is that both Kathleen and Frank are victims of heart-felt emotions at a time when expressing them is unthinkable. They are equally challenged by simple and earnest desires to "fill the void" in their lives: Kathleen with her giant colorblind heart in a cold society of bigots and Frank in his corporate supremacy and his "It's a different kind of love, Charlie Brown" headache. One reviewer said Frank was abusive, closeted (sure, obviously, duh) and an alcoholic. I guess if you'd ever been through that type of situation you might be a bit more forgiving because it is hell and I came from the 50s so trust. Each of these obviously well-developed characters is simply doing the best they can in a world where their ground-breaking feelings are out of place. I loved it. I own it. And I, clearly, do not advise that slim minds or socially challenged people attempt it. However, if you can watch a movie and not be a judge, if you can accept things not from your time and not about you but about very, very grand new ideas, it's an extremely well-made, well-acted and accurate film.

Not only you would notice what a chameleon Oscar Isaac is, but you might enjoy the classic mood and character-driven vibe of that film as well.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69128,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"new york city,american dream,oil,year 1981,immigrant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi891727641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City 1981, an ambitious immigrant fights to protect his business and family during the most dangerous year in the city's history.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1567113/","name":"Jessica Chastain","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654648/","name":"David Oyelowo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1170855/","name":"J.C.

Julianne Moore is excellent and deserving of the acclaim she's received for this role, as well as Quaid in the supporting role.

The family's best-known member today is Maria's aunt Adele, whose portrait Gustav Klimt painted in 1907. The painting was appropriated during the Nazi era and for many years hung in the Austrian state's famous Belvedere Gallery, as "the Mona Lisa of Vienna." After her sister's death, Maria finds correspondence suggesting the painting was perhaps not left to the government of Austria in her aunt's will, as it claimed, and therefore not rightfully Austrian property. She hires a family friend's son, Randol Schoenberg (played by Ryan Reynolds), a young down-on-his-luck Los Angeles attorney, to look into the matter. Schoenberg, grandson of the composer—another refugee from Nazified Austria—is out of touch with his family's past and slow to recognize the significance of Maria's quest. Initially unwilling to take on the case, he is gradually drawn into it. Their bureaucratic battles with stonewalling Austrian officials soon unite the pair, and they are joined by a crusading Austrian journalist, Hubertus Czernin. Formidable legal and bureaucratic hurdles stand in the way of Maria being reuniting with the painting—"When you look at this painting, you see a work of art," Marie tells a reunification commission, "I see my aunt." The story is another in a long line of mostly not happy stories of stolen art works in World War II, brought to renewed public awareness by movies and books like The Monuments Men and Pictures at an Exhibition. The opportunity to reunite beloved works of art and their owners is rapidly disappearing, yet this beautifully filmed movie, directed by Simon Curtis, shows the importance of continuing these efforts. Because this film is based on a true story, and I for one remembered how it ends, a certain inevitability about the outcome guides the plot. Perhaps this is what has caused reviewers (not me!) to find it dull, though they find the actors captivating.

Murrow" Collection from CBS for years and have enjoyed watching it's biography of Murrow, the complete Milo Radulovich, McCarthy and Annie Lee Moss shows many times. I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama "Good Night and Good Luck". As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.\n\nThere are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of "You Are There", a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being "there" when he didn't really want to be.\n\nWhat really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was "The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post"  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue.

I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with.

He wound up being "there" when he didn't really want to be.\n\nWhat really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was "The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post"  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Uma is refusing to give up her inferior boyfriend for an arranged marriage. It's an island retreat run by The Duchess (Milla Jovovich). The other girls include overweight Chloe (Danielle Macdonald), allergic Yu (Awkwafina), and singing star Amarna (Eiza González). Being imprisoned on an island gilded cage is not the end of the horror.\n\nThe general premise is fine but the intensity is never raised to a higher level.

But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie.\n\n A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade.

Car Marko Aurelije (R. Harris) pokušava spriječiti prodor barbarskih plemena na sjevernim granicama u čemu mu presudno pomaže hrabri posinak i vojskovođa Maximus (R. Crowe). Nakon pobjede u krvavom boju, ostarjeli vladar upravo u Maximusu vidi svog nasljednika, iako ga u Rimu čeka njegov rođeni sin Komod (J. Phoenix). Doznavši da će ostati bez carske titule, beskrupulozni Komod odluči ubrzati stupanje na prijestolje, te nakon očeve smrti zapovjedi ubistvo Maximusa i njegove porodice. Za razliku od porodice, Maximus izbjegne smrt, ali ne i odlazak u roblje pri čemu ga kupuje Proximo (O. Reed) koji trenira najbolje gladijatore u Carstvu. Postavši Proximov najslavniji borac u areni, Maximus se zavjetuje da će usred Rima osvetiti smrt svoje neprežaljene porodice.</desc>

Archaeologist and explorer extraordinaire, Lara Croft, journeys to a temple which has sunken underwater in search of lost treasures. During her expedition, Croft happens upon a sphere that contains the mythical Pandora's Box, only to have it stolen from her by Chen Lo, the leader of a Chinese crime syndicate. Chen Lo is in league with a bad guy named Reiss, who wants to use the priceless Box as a doomsday weapon. The plot sounds okay but the main reason someone would see this film is for the action scenes and Angelina Jolie. People just wanting those two things will probably enjoy this film. People that want a good story and better direction should skip this film. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. However, the story is weak and the film doesn't quite make sense at times either. I think the person that should be blamed is Jan de Bont. He is a terrible director and can't build up suspense very well. He did a bit better then Simon West but still the studio should have hired someone else. The acting is good not great but nothing horrible either. Angelina Jolie does a good job of playing Lara Croft and she is also very breathtaking in the film. Gerard Butler does a good job as well though sometimes his performance wasn't very interesting. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. Another problem I had with this film is that it gets boring at times. Having a lot of action doesn't mean its audience will be entertained. The movie's running time is 117 minutes which is a bit longer then the original. I think they could have cut the film down to about the same length as there some pointless scenes. If you hated the original then you should skip this film as the film is more of the same but it is more entertaining. As long as you don't try to notice too many of the mistakes in the film then you should enjoy it. If your looking for a serious action flick then just skip this.

Brad is all over the place. The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end. Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene. Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more. In contrast with some negative and maybe unrealistic reviews that I read here, if you like a mix of mild father-son drama together with sci-fi, this is a very nice film to watch. 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"astronaut,outer space,father son relationship,moon,missing father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ad Astra","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836788505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550948/","name":"Ruth Negga"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452101/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342473/","name":"Ethan Gross"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Brad is all over the place. The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end. Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene. Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more. In contrast with some negative and maybe unrealistic reviews that I read here, if you like a mix of mild father-son drama together with sci-fi, this is a very nice film to watch. 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"astronaut,outer space,father son relationship,moon,missing father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ad Astra","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836788505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550948/","name":"Ruth Negga"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342473/","name":"Ethan Gross"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right.

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was a good film. Not great, not intense as the first two Godfather flicks, but definitely a lot better than advertised.\n\nMany people said this was filled with anti-Roman Catholic propaganda, but I didn't it find that way. Yes, the "Vatican bank," whatever that is, was portrayed as not on the up-and-up, but it was a little confusing to follow, maybe too confusing to get offended! Actually, there were some positive things, religious-wise, with Al Pacino's character, who sought forgiveness for his past sins and made a few very profound statements such as, "What good is confession if it isn't followed by repentance?"\n\nAnyway, Pacino's acting talents are the main attraction in the lower-key, more cerebral Godfather film. There isn't that much action but when it occurs, it's pretty violent. As with the other two films in the series, it's nicely photographed with a lot of nice brown tints.\n\nFinally, director-writer Francis Ford Coppola took a lot of flak for putting his daughter in such an important role but I thought she (Sofia Coppola) was fine and - like this film - unfairly criticized.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":374624,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1990-12-25","keywords":"opera,gangster,catholic church,violence,organized crime","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1237827865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDYyZmQyMjMtMGQyMS00YjYwLWIxZWEtMzQ0ODNlYzFkM2YyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDYyZmQyMjMtMGQyMS00YjYwLWIxZWEtMzQ0ODNlYzFkM2YyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"See the never-before-seen version of the final film, The #GodfatherCoda: The Death of Michael Corleone.

It was a good film. Not great, not intense as the first two Godfather flicks, but definitely a lot better than advertised.\n\nMany people said this was filled with anti-Roman Catholic propaganda, but I didn't it find that way. Yes, the "Vatican bank," whatever that is, was portrayed as not on the up-and-up, but it was a little confusing to follow, maybe too confusing to get offended! Actually, there were some positive things, religious-wise, with Al Pacino's character, who sought forgiveness for his past sins and made a few very profound statements such as, "What good is confession if it isn't followed by repentance?"\n\nAnyway, Pacino's acting talents are the main attraction in the lower-key, more cerebral Godfather film. There isn't that much action but when it occurs, it's pretty violent. As with the other two films in the series, it's nicely photographed with a lot of nice brown tints.\n\nFinally, director-writer Francis Ford Coppola took a lot of flak for putting his daughter in such an important role but I thought she (Sofia Coppola) was fine and - like this film - unfairly criticized.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":374624,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1990-12-25","keywords":"opera,gangster,catholic church,violence,organized crime","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1237827865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDYyZmQyMjMtMGQyMS00YjYwLWIxZWEtMzQ0ODNlYzFkM2YyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDYyZmQyMjMtMGQyMS00YjYwLWIxZWEtMzQ0ODNlYzFkM2YyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"See the never-before-seen version of the final film, The #GodfatherCoda: The Death of Michael Corleone.

It is always read as Louis the fifteenth or often in French Quinze (pronounced cans - and that is exactly what the close caption said in the style of Louis cans - I had to explain that one to my mom!) Then a few moments later, Miss Marple talked about the problem of yarn balls vs skeins, except the close caption said yarn scans. So confusing for the reader.

It has all the elements to make it an award winning piece. Great complicated characters that work well with each other, mystery, intrigue, excitement, shell shock, suggestive, authentic and genuine. Who new that Germany had the ability to produce a show like this that would compete with BBC period series. It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s. The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it.

Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.\n\nThe year is 1965 and an eccentric young Detective Constable, Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans), is making waves at the Oxford City Police with not only his unorthodox but brilliant methods of deduction, but for his refusal to tow the line in order to please the upper echelons of both the Force and society. Under the steadfast guidance of the seasoned and similarly incorruptible, Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), Morse finds himself embroiled in a number of complex cases that expose him to the darker side of life and human nature.\n\nAlthough the series will naturally draw comparisons to its popular predecessor, thanks to the show's gripping narratives, vibrant swinging sixties backdrop and perfect blend of light and dark overtones, Endeavour is easily able to distinguish itself by its own considerable merits. \n\nMuch of the show's success can be attributed to the ingenious casting of Evans, who puts his own unique stamp on the iconic role. Of course there are parallels to the world weary DI so expertly embodied by John Thaw, but Evans wisely avoids imitation, as the twenty-year age difference between the two interpretations allows the actor to create something fresh. The addition of the character of Fred Thursday is inspired. The street wise, war veteran is the perfect mentor for the idealistic Morse and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series. Fantastic entertainment on every level!\n\nhttp://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.\n\nThe year is 1965 and an eccentric young Detective Constable, Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans), is making waves at the Oxford City Police with not only his unorthodox but brilliant methods of deduction, but for his refusal to tow the line in order to please the upper echelons of both the Force and society. Under the steadfast guidance of the seasoned and similarly incorruptible, Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), Morse finds himself embroiled in a number of complex cases that expose him to the darker side of life and human nature.\n\nAlthough the series will naturally draw comparisons to its popular predecessor, thanks to the show's gripping narratives, vibrant swinging sixties backdrop and perfect blend of light and dark overtones, Endeavour is easily able to distinguish itself by its own considerable merits. \n\nMuch of the show's success can be attributed to the ingenious casting of Evans, who puts his own unique stamp on the iconic role. Of course there are parallels to the world weary DI so expertly embodied by John Thaw, but Evans wisely avoids imitation, as the twenty-year age difference between the two interpretations allows the actor to create something fresh. The addition of the character of Fred Thursday is inspired. The street wise, war veteran is the perfect mentor for the idealistic Morse and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series. Fantastic entertainment on every level!\n\nhttp://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The devastation I felt when Morse went, then Poirot, then finally Foyle's War was pretty big, three of the best shows from the last twenty years in my opinion, but Endeavour has taken the mantle.\n\nMorse had a unique quality, different to all others, I truly feel that all those behind Endeavour have managed to capture that DNA and bring it to life. Shaun Evans is magical in the role, as the show goes on I feel that he's really managed o capture the essence of John Thaw, he'd have been proud. Roger Allam was the perfect actor to cast as Thursday, he is consistently superb, a joy to watch. I also love the fact that Abigail Thaw was given a recurring role, respectful. That also extends to the appearances of Colin Dexter, until his death in 2017.\n\nThe Morse series was so rich in detail that Endeavour could well run for several years, the content is so deliciously high in quality that there's plenty to draw from.\n\nSo many brilliant episodes, favourites of mine include Quartet, Icarus and Neverland, but how do you chose? \n\nPlease let this run for many years, viewing at its best. 10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20803,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Instead, I got a beautifully shot, smartly written, excellently acted, and a very "high quality" feel to everything. \n\nDare I say it, but I get slight Breaking Bad vibes from the cinematography and just the overall feel of everything. For example, the use of the music at the end of the pilot episode and the opening segment of the second episode that seemed random and unrelated to the main plot at hand. That isn't to say it feels ripped off, because it's not. It actually feels fresh and exciting to watch. Compared to most other shows this summer (example, The Last Ship) this is superior in every way conceivable, unless of course you're looking for the good guys blowing up the bad guys. \n\nThe second episode was just as impressive as the first. In fact, I actually watched it twice due to there being nothing else on TV. I never do that with anything.\n\nI sincerely hope WGN picks this up for another season. The fact that there are still under 500 votes on IMDb as of the second episode leave me a little worried about how the ratings fare.\n\nI guess the only thing the show could be doing better is having a better title sequence (think LOST, 24, Breaking Bad, etc. Just something simple but satisfying)!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8091,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has all the elements to make it an award winning piece. Great complicated characters that work well with each other, mystery, intrigue, excitement, shell shock, suggestive, authentic and genuine. Who new that Germany had the ability to produce a show like this that would compete with BBC period series. It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s. The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it. If you like time pieces and or like shows such as Endeavor, George Gently, Trapped, Modus and similar then you are likely to enjoy this program.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-10-13","keywords":"berlin germany,1920s,police,weimar republic,interwar period","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1432815/","name":"Volker Bruch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2939186/","name":"Liv Lisa Fries","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2914059/","name":"Leonie Benesch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061958/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044017/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359634/","name":"Henk Handloegten","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0902022/","name":"Achim von Borries"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2628238873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And I wasn't disappointed. There are so many things I love about this show, but most of all it is hilarious to watch the characters interact with each other. Kyra Sedgwick excellently portrays a tough woman who won't let people walk all over her. People complain that Brenda is a b****, but maybe that's the point. What fun would it be to watch a show with nothing but sweetness and joy between the main characters, no conflict whatsoever? The tension she endures and often causes just makes the show all the more entertaining.\n\nWhat is most irritating, however, is to hear people complain about how the perpetrators in each show is obvious. Anybody who had listened what TNT had been saying about the show before it premiered would know that they said from the beginning that this show would be unlike other crime dramas in that the crime would not be the main focus. This show is ABOUT Brenda Johnson.\n\nSo, in conclusion, this is an excellent, intelligent, amusing show, and I am sad to see the season end.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together. The sets and costumes are well done (suitable for the time period),and highly detailed. \n\nThe story line doesn't explore any real substantial questions of politics, culture, war, or social values...yet.

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together. The sets and costumes are well done (suitable for the time period),and highly detailed. \n\nThe story line doesn't explore any real substantial questions of politics, culture, war, or social values...yet. It's enjoyable, mindless entertainment, excellently done, with great potential for more robust story lines. Although the episodes might not have been filmed in the release-date order, the staging, story, and characters appeared to mature as the first season progressed.\n\nBut there is one travesty: They do a disservice to a good actor, and to women everywhere, by not giving their excellent female star better billing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-13","keywords":"psychotronic series,tv mini series","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922995/","name":"Michael Weston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542118/","name":"Stephen Mangan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146945/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0131363/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395924/","name":"David Hoselton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0864435/","name":"David N.

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together. The sets and costumes are well done (suitable for the time period),and highly detailed. \n\nThe story line doesn't explore any real substantial questions of politics, culture, war, or social values...yet.

 --- Description: Houdini and Doyle: Created by David Hoselton, David N. Titcher. With Michael Weston, Stephen Mangan, Rebecca Liddiard, Emily Carey.

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together. The sets and costumes are well done (suitable for the time period),and highly detailed. \n\nThe story line doesn't explore any real substantial questions of politics, culture, war, or social values...yet. It's enjoyable, mindless entertainment, excellently done, with great potential for more robust story lines. Although the episodes might not have been filmed in the release-date order, the staging, story, and characters appeared to mature as the first season progressed.\n\nBut there is one travesty: They do a disservice to a good actor, and to women everywhere, by not giving their excellent female star better billing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-13","keywords":"psychotronic series,tv mini series","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922995/","name":"Michael Weston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542118/","name":"Stephen Mangan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146945/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0131363/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395924/","name":"David Hoselton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0864435/","name":"David N.

Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. \n\nI did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.\n\nIn the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior. As the story continues those two have slowly become my favorite and I just want to give them a hug, they deserve something good to find it's way to them.\n\nThis way of telling the story is central and easy as it grabs hold of once affection for those characters that live in this town and they grow on you. The town has this (Gilmore Girls) Stars Hollow feel to it with all its fun and strange traditions that without a doubt gives the show part of the charm\n\nThe acting varies very much depending on the actor but again it does not stands out as much as one might think. The stories are often very sweet and reveal the personalized twist of life.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49484,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And the movie itself is also quite good. Although it has the neccessary light touch, it's also rather adulty. Films of this calibre wouldn't usually have quite so much innuendo and sex-talk in them. This doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie, but it certainly is surprising.\n\nThere's a good cast to back this up. Kirstie Alley is ideal as the sexy single mother.

I think that, for the Greek people, this movie must be full of topics and stereotypes, but for the ones who don't know about Greek ways of life is pretty funny. There are all kind of weird characters (the grandma!!!), and the starring actress makes an outstanding job showing us the metamorphosis of that timid girl to a liberated one. Nice dialogs, nice rhythm... Just a nice entertainment for a Saturday afternoon.\n\n*My Rate 6/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124346,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2002-12-25","keywords":"greek restaurant,culture clash,greek,wedding,cross cultural relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"My Big Fat Greek Wedding","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3014459673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGE2NTgwN2YtMzJlMi00ZTc4LWI5MDEtMGRmMTA2NTQwODcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGE2NTgwN2YtMzJlMi00ZTc4LWI5MDEtMGRmMTA2NTQwODcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889522/","name":"Nia Vardalos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179173/","name":"John Corbett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176073/","name":"Michael Constantine"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0959034/","name":"Joel Zwick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009247/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889522/","name":"Nia Vardalos"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A weak, pale imitation clone, but a clone none the less. It was inevitable that following the success of a "Look Who Is Talking" that a sequel would follow. It was also inevitable that the sequel would be of inferior quality. \n\nPlot in A Paragraph: Mollie (Kirstie Alley) and James (John Travolta) are together and raising a family, which now consists of an older Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis) and his baby sister, Julie (Roseanne Barr)\n\nAll the charm of the original movie is missing, what made the first movie so good was it was new, fresh and original. This is more of the same but without the originality, freshness, and newness. Instead it has Roseanne Barr. \n\nMy God, her voice is annoying!!

A weak, pale imitation clone, but a clone none the less. It was inevitable that following the success of a "Look Who Is Talking" that a sequel would follow. It was also inevitable that the sequel would be of inferior quality. \n\nPlot in A Paragraph: Mollie (Kirstie Alley) and James (John Travolta) are together and raising a family, which now consists of an older Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis) and his baby sister, Julie (Roseanne Barr)\n\nAll the charm of the original movie is missing, what made the first movie so good was it was new, fresh and original. This is more of the same but without the originality, freshness, and newness. Instead it has Roseanne Barr. \n\nMy God, her voice is annoying!! The script is weak, Travolta and Alley do not enjoy the same chemistry as in the first movie (which is a shame) Bruce Willis remains fun, but that is about it!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45690,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Family","Romance"],"datePublished":"1990-12-14","keywords":"baby,potty training,childbirth,toddler,sequel","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000263/","name":"Kirstie Alley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001156/","name":"Olympia Dukakis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052950/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0692605/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0411477/","name":"Neal Israel"],"duration":"PT1H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Would have got an 8 but I'm super hard on the female acting in these new generation of movies.\n\nThis movie by now is 9 years old so nothing would be giving it away. But with that said Linda Hamilton in the first one was 19 years old. And she can act. Which is why 7 or 8 years later in Terminator 2 her acting was polished the movie was even better. It is not a secret if the female character can act you are going to have a good movie. The female acting in this movie was decent which is why it got a 7 from me.\n\nBut I can see why people gave this a one. The first Terminators were scary. The machine just kept going. You also had the awesome 80's music, along with the clothes. I mean seriously Sarah O conner was riding an 80's scoter and listening to head phones. And going to the club. Just a lot of vintage stuff in that movie which brought it back to the 80's. The 90's was even better in T2, crazy hair cuts, dirt bikes and the graphics in that at the time were unique. \n\nBut they did try to incorporate some of the old ideas. John Conner goes "come with me if you want to live", the motor cycle scene still is exciting as it was almost 30 years ago. The naked terminator. Normally during these remakes I get bored or fall asleep. It was action through the whole movie. I don't know if it was christian bale. Or who it was. But I felt entertained. \n\nIf people came here looking at this review thinking they are get a play by play of the movie. I'm not doing that with this one. You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done. \n\nOnce again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not. Its just going to be great acting and simply a plot that action. Nothing over the top where its mind blowing. Expecting this movie to be like the first 1 where they were on to something new, and the second one where they had some super special effects is asking too much. It was well written movie.

The photography was beautiful, the acting excellent, and the supporting players added an extra "punch" to the story line. Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters.

They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

I had high expectations, was hoping for a decent sci-fi movie but instead I got a quite boring drama. I wouldn't say the actors were bad, far from that, Natalie Portman and the rest did their job, but the story was just weak, certainly for the first half of the movie. The movie was also much too long, certainly for the story they wanted to tell. I wouldn't waste too much time on this one if I were you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-10-04","keywords":"astronaut,close up of eye,multiple aspect ratios,character name in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing Only In Theaters","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2276769561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNDUxYWItMjkzOC00OWNlLTk2MzItOTRjMjMzMGJlZDhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNDUxYWItMjkzOC00OWNlLTk2MzItOTRjMjMzMGJlZDhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Astronaut Lucy Cola's space mission leaves her deeply moved by the experience of seeing her life from afar.

Everything I heard left me feeling like yeah, OK, I'm going for Denzel. Denzel vs. Clive Owen will be interesting.\n\nFrom the first shots and opening credits, you are submerged in artistic vision, and a finely honed piece of work the likes of which I haven't seen in years. I'd almost give this one a ten.. and I don't hand out tens freely. I do not want to spoil this. You have to walk in cold, and let this film grab you by the short and curlies.\n\nThis is one film where there isn't a spare frame or wasted cheap shot. Every zinger zings, and there are laughs too, laughs at merciful intervals to break the tension and remind an audience on the edges of its seats that movie-going's supposed to be entertaining, dammit. The cinematography is brilliant, and the music is fantastic - true cinematic score, true genius.

Everything I heard left me feeling like yeah, OK, I'm going for Denzel. Denzel vs. Clive Owen will be interesting.\n\nFrom the first shots and opening credits, you are submerged in artistic vision, and a finely honed piece of work the likes of which I haven't seen in years. I'd almost give this one a ten.. and I don't hand out tens freely. I do not want to spoil this. You have to walk in cold, and let this film grab you by the short and curlies.\n\nThis is one film where there isn't a spare frame or wasted cheap shot. Every zinger zings, and there are laughs too, laughs at merciful intervals to break the tension and remind an audience on the edges of its seats that movie-going's supposed to be entertaining, dammit. The cinematography is brilliant, and the music is fantastic - true cinematic score, true genius. I can't praise this one enough.\n\nChristopher Plummer is superb, in what is (perhaps coincidentally) an ironic bit of casting.

There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my "seeing as many 2018 films as possible" quest.\n\nThis is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not necessary to see the first two movies to follow Before Midnight. The movie features long takes (sometimes not cutting for 10 minutes at a time) the story takes place over a day, and dialogue and naturalistic acting are paramount. There's a complexity to their characters and relationship that refuses to fully romanticize or demonize them. It's something of a realist romance in (deliberate) contrast the beautiful settings. Careful viewers will notice a handful of ironies that ground the romance in reality. I won't give examples here, or go into the details that keep me from giving this a 9 or 10 as many critics do. The movie is the proverbial breath of fresh air, though. I'd say that the main weakness of the movie stems from its strengths, in that when artists set out to make something so true to human nature (as opposed to fluffier rom coms or Nicholas Sparks movies) it's easy to hear the (few) false notes that are played. There are very few; and unless you're jonesing for a mere-nonsense 'entertainment' movie, this movie should appeal to practically anyone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148464,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-13","keywords":"marriage,hotel,hotel room,writer,dinner","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4026246681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTEzMjcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2NzIzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTEzMjcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2NzIzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"We meet Celine and Jesse 9 years on.

It's not necessary to see the first two movies to follow Before Midnight. The movie features long takes (sometimes not cutting for 10 minutes at a time) the story takes place over a day, and dialogue and naturalistic acting are paramount. There's a complexity to their characters and relationship that refuses to fully romanticize or demonize them. It's something of a realist romance in (deliberate) contrast the beautiful settings. Careful viewers will notice a handful of ironies that ground the romance in reality. I won't give examples here, or go into the details that keep me from giving this a 9 or 10 as many critics do. The movie is the proverbial breath of fresh air, though. I'd say that the main weakness of the movie stems from its strengths, in that when artists set out to make something so true to human nature (as opposed to fluffier rom coms or Nicholas Sparks movies) it's easy to hear the (few) false notes that are played. There are very few; and unless you're jonesing for a mere-nonsense 'entertainment' movie, this movie should appeal to practically anyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148464,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-13","keywords":"marriage,hotel,hotel room,writer,dinner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4026246681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTEzMjcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2NzIzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTEzMjcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2NzIzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"We meet Celine and Jesse 9 years on.

Co-stars Shu Qi (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).\n\nHighly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":292569,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-12-11","keywords":"gunfight,premarital sex,mixed martial arts,tape over mouth,motor car","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Transporter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3455779097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RjMjA2ZGQtMDJlMy00Mzk4LWJjNDYtNGJjMzczNzc3MGQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RjMjA2ZGQtMDJlMy00Mzk4LWJjNDYtNGJjMzczNzc3MGQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795517/","name":"Shu Qi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776580/","name":"Matt Schulze"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477035/","name":"Corey Yuen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051228/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000108/","name":"Luc Besson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Easily one of the better books of the entire series by JK Rowling (including books 5 and 6), the darker and scarier take on the story was welcomed by fans of the films and the books everywhere as Director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) attempts to attach his name to an ever-growing franchise. But, rest assured, this film has many flaws.\n\nFor one, the acting remains a substantial problem that is bound to plague the fans for the remainder of the franchise, including the next few films that are already signed up. The big budget and the excellent special effects can't alleviate the responsibility that the three young actors have to presenting decent performances. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), despite improving immensely since the previous installment, remains stiff and uncharismatic on screen whereas Emma Watson's melodramatic take on the character of Hermione had the entire audience frustrated. She seems to be throwing herself into her role with too much gusto and enthusiasm, resulting in a pretentious and unsatisfying performance that remains a plague on the rest of the film's merits. Dumbledore is pathetic in his role, completely misunderstanding the direction of his character and ultimately illustrating Newell's lack of grasp of what Harry Potter is really all about. The only actor that seems to stand out in a positive light is indeed Rupert Grint (Ron) who takes his performance easily. From his flawless comic timing to his understanding of the more serious scenes as well, here is an actor we will no doubt see after the Harry Potter film franchise has concluded. He stands out as the more talented of the three teenagers.\n\nNewell's direction is furthermore extremely flawed, surprising after the brilliant and entertaining "Donnie Brasco". Not only does he fail to understand the needs and wants of the actors in their respective performances, but he seems to also clutch no grasp of what made this book so amazing. Gone now is the magic of Chris Columbus in the first and second installments of the franchise, and supposedly Newell was to present a darker take on our heroes. He does so, but at what expense? Whereas the book by all means illustrated a darker take, it did so through a compromise with the more magical and "Christmassy" elements of the first few Harry Potter books as well as the scarier elements. Newell completely abandons the magic of the first few films and goes for an all out "noir", losing one of the best bits about a Harry Potter film: magic.\n\nThe script remains tarred, leaving out some of the best and most entertaining elements of the novel such as the opening Quidditch World Cup - an exhilarating read and surely an excellent addition to the film? Once again, the elements that made the book so magical are completely left out in the script and are failed to be remedied by Newell's poor direction. The script's inability to identify emotions and character is further exemplified through the completely underdeveloped problem of Ron's jealousy of Harry, as well as the seemingly over-developed problem of Ron and Hermione's increasingly changing relationship. Where the book merely hints at such a concept, the script-writer deems it at the forefront and shows a half-assed attempt at a romantic comedy within a few weak scenes. It doesn't help when Emma Watson takes it seriously, either.\n\nThat being said, the special effects are relatively good throughout the three tasks that our Tri-Wizard champions must face - ranging from the amazing sequence of Harry dodging left and right to avoid the Hungarian Horntail Dragon hot on his heels, to the murky depths of the school lake as Harry explores the underworld of the blue. The cinematography of the film is fairly decent also, but by no means a notch above the previous three films. Other technical aspects such as the score and the editing are relatively impressive but again pose no substantial superiority over the previous three films.\n\nTo sum up the film ... Different; yes. Better; not necessarily. A darker take definitely, Newell forgets to show the real magic behind the Harry Potter franchise. Poor acting for major characters, a patchy and inconsistent script that seemingly misinterprets the brilliance of Rowling's fourth novel, and Newell's inability to direct both the action and the actors on screen result in a film that is mediocre at best and completely undeserving of the recent hype that has accompanied its theatrical release. \n\nAll we can hope for is that the next film brings back the magic.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":572929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2005-11-23","keywords":"tournament,wizard,magic,school of magic,heroism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2611740953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY3NzkxMjMtZjMwNy00OTYwLWJhNDktZDgwZDZmMzZmOWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY3NzkxMjMtZjMwNy00OTYwLWJhNDktZDgwZDZmMzZmOWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001565/","name":"Mike Newell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176128/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp "farting," that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations. Shrek has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":637751,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-08-15","keywords":"onion,epic,exploding animal,arm ripped off,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4085711129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU5ZDE5NTItN2I1YS00ZmFmLTk3YTgtNzQwOGNkYzFjOWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU5ZDE5NTItN2I1YS00ZmFmLTk3YTgtNzQwOGNkYzFjOWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421776/","name":"Vicky Jenson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254645/","name":"Ted Elliott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744429/","name":"Terry Rossio"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp "farting," that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations. Shrek has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":637751,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-08-15","keywords":"onion,epic,exploding animal,arm ripped off,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4085711129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU5ZDE5NTItN2I1YS00ZmFmLTk3YTgtNzQwOGNkYzFjOWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU5ZDE5NTItN2I1YS00ZmFmLTk3YTgtNzQwOGNkYzFjOWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421776/","name":"Vicky Jenson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254645/","name":"Ted Elliott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744429/","name":"Terry Rossio"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Cannot judge which one is better","reviewBody":"Finally saw LITTLE WOMEN 2019. Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).\n\nTwo things really grabbed me.\n\n1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Cannot judge which one is better","reviewBody":"Finally saw LITTLE WOMEN 2019. Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).\n\nTwo things really grabbed me.\n\n1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"],"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie did its best to earn the heartstring-pulls at the end, and it was certainly an emotionally satisfying and uplifting end to the trilogy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1575452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"dc comics,batman character,bruce wayne character,terrorist plot,sequel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nokia Promotions Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2376312089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MjAxODE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3ODgwOA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MjAxODE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3ODgwOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the special Nokia promotional trailer for The Dark Knight Rises.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634300/","name":"Jonathan Nolan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275286/","name":"David S.

It is also a little bit like Fringe. However there is no time travel or alternative universes in this yet. But I can see how i like it based on these two TV shows; there is a lot going on and you want to keep watching to see what happens. Acting may be a little mechanical and not as much depth to some characters that I would like but it looks good and is an interesting weird idea.

The dialogue is deeply cheesy and often terrible. The special effects are atrocious. And season four has developed the unfortunate habit of winking to its fans a little too often.\n\nAnd yet, the whole thing has such effusive love both in front of and behind the camera that I can't help but be caught up by it. The actors are clearly having the time of their lives with goofy material, and that enthusiasm is infectious. WayHaught is one of the best ships in recent memory not just because it's fairly well-written, but because Dominique Provost-Chalkley and Katherine Barrell are clearly invested in their characters and doing right by them. And no matter how corny or ridiculous Wynonna's antics become, Melanie Scrofano anchors the show with her fearless performance.\n\nIn short, the definition of guilty pleasure TV. Give it at least the first five episodes to hit its stride and don't take it too seriously - it certainly doesn't - by then you won't even think about looking back.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"based on comic,lesbian,lesbian relationship,idw comics,wyatt earp","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234276/","name":"Melanie Scrofano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747653/","name":"Tim Rozon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3176450/","name":"Dominique Provost-Chalkley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202933/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wynonna Earp Season Two","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi16366361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everyone has demons, but hers are real."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The dialogue is deeply cheesy and often terrible. The special effects are atrocious. And season four has developed the unfortunate habit of winking to its fans a little too often.\n\nAnd yet, the whole thing has such effusive love both in front of and behind the camera that I can't help but be caught up by it. The actors are clearly having the time of their lives with goofy material, and that enthusiasm is infectious. WayHaught is one of the best ships in recent memory not just because it's fairly well-written, but because Dominique Provost-Chalkley and Katherine Barrell are clearly invested in their characters and doing right by them. And no matter how corny or ridiculous Wynonna's antics become, Melanie Scrofano anchors the show with her fearless performance.\n\nIn short, the definition of guilty pleasure TV. Give it at least the first five episodes to hit its stride and don't take it too seriously - it certainly doesn't - by then you won't even think about looking back.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"based on comic,lesbian,lesbian relationship,idw comics,wyatt earp","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234276/","name":"Melanie Scrofano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747653/","name":"Tim Rozon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3176450/","name":"Dominique Provost-Chalkley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202933/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wynonna Earp Season Two","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi16366361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everyone has demons, but hers are real."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The actors are clearly having the time of their lives with goofy material, and that enthusiasm is infectious. WayHaught is one of the best ships in recent memory not just because it's fairly well-written, but because Dominique Provost-Chalkley and Katherine Barrell are clearly invested in their characters and doing right by them. And no matter how corny or ridiculous Wynonna's antics become, Melanie Scrofano anchors the show with her fearless performance.\n\nIn short, the definition of guilty pleasure TV. Give it at least the first five episodes to hit its stride and don't take it too seriously - it certainly doesn't - by then you won't even think about looking back.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"based on comic,lesbian,lesbian relationship,idw comics,wyatt earp","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234276/","name":"Melanie Scrofano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747653/","name":"Tim Rozon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3176450/","name":"Dominique Provost-Chalkley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202933/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wynonna Earp Season Two","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi16366361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everyone has demons, but hers are real."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
