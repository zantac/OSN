It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.\n\nIt feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.\n\nTarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.\n\nYet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of "ultra-violence," it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.\n\nAnd that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":969640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-09-02","keywords":"heist gone wrong,nonlinear timeline,mexican standoff,robbery,graphic violence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Reservoir Dogs: 10th Anniversary Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3028484377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000172/","name":"Harvey Keitel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000514/","name":"Michael Madsen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0112857/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000812/","name":"Roger Avary"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":969640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-09-02","keywords":"heist gone wrong,nonlinear timeline,mexican standoff,robbery,graphic violence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Reservoir Dogs: 10th Anniversary Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3028484377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000172/","name":"Harvey Keitel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000514/","name":"Michael Madsen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0112857/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000812/","name":"Roger Avary"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Hollywood Singing And Dancing</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure: Directed by Mark McLaughlin. With Julie Andrews, Fred Astaire, Obba Babatundé, John Badham. HOLLYWOOD SINGING &amp; DANCING: A MUSICAL TREASURE is a celebration of song and dance, beginning with the Busby Berkeley films that lifted the spirits of audiences during the Great Depression, through the patriotic musicals of the 1940s and ending with the collapse of the studio system in the 1950s. Hosted by Academy Award winning stage, screen and television icon, Shirley Jones, this "docutainment" film is a grand historical look at the magic of musical Hollywood. Highlighted are amazing songs and dance numbers, little-known facts, and luminaries who made the magic possible such as Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Betty Grable, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, James Cagney, Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Donen, Frank Sinatra, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger. Mesmerizing sequences are interspersed with fresh new commentary by Liza Minnelli, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, Jane Russell, Rita Moreno, Pat Boone, Rob Marshall, Bill Condon, Shirley MacLaine, Tommy Tune, Joel Grey, Smokey Robinson, Patti Page, Tab Hunter, George Chakiris, Rhonda Fleming, Betty Garrett, Marge Champion, Joan Leslie, Robert Osborne, Stella Stevens, Gloria Stuart and others. FILMS INCLUDE: The Wizard of Oz, Dames, Fashions of 1934, The Little Colonel, Gold Diggers of 1935, Billboard Girl, Something to Sing About, Little Princess, Meet Me In St. Louis, Babes on Broadway, Yankee Doodle Dandy, On the Town, The Harvey Girls, Cover Girl, The King and I, An American In Paris, Singin' In The Rain, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Till the Clouds Roll By, Royal Wedding, Damn Yankees, Gigi, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Oklahoma!, Carousel and Chicago." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1147738/","name":"Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FmZjNlYmQtMjllNi00ZmZiLWEyNWUtZjE2ZWE5NTljYzE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDYxMTUwNg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"HOLLYWOOD SINGING &amp; DANCING: A MUSICAL TREASURE is a celebration of song and dance, beginning with the Busby Berkeley films that lifted the spirits of audiences during the Great Depression, through the patriotic musicals of the 1940s","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1147738/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"danddinmont"},"dateCreated":"2008-03-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"Does not compare favorably to "That's Entertainment" (Parts I thru III)","reviewBody":"Because this was shown during a PBS fund drive, and all the other "specials" that were being shown were more than five years old, I thought this show was another that had been dragged out of the archives. \n\nWhat a surprise, it's new!

The story, about friendship and loneliness and also society as it was then, is good of course even if it is slightly modified. But I do not care if it is, for the actors are good and the filmmaking is too. I especially like William Takaku (Friday).

    <title lang="hr">Mala bubnjarica</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Mala bubnjarica je priča temeljena na istoimenom književnom remek-djelu Johna le Carréa. To je ujedno strastvena ljubavna priča i duboko upečatljiv triler. Serija "Mala bubnjarica" temelji se na istoimenom bestseleru Johna le Carréa. To je strastvena ljubavna priča i triler koji će vas potpuno zaokupiti. Priča je jednako smiona sada kao što je bila kad je knjiga prvi put objavljena; to je prikaz svijeta u kojem su granice između junaka i zlikovaca te ljubavi i mržnje opasno nejasne. Taj uzbudljivi triler događa se krajem sedamdesetih godina prošloga stoljeća i pratimo Charlie (Pugh), mladu, vatrenu, ali neostvarenu britansku glumicu punu ideala. Na odmoru u Grčkoj ona upoznaje tajanstvenoga Beckera (Skarsgard) i on njezinu odlučnost stavlja na kušnju. Brzo postane jasno da je lažno prikazao svoje namjere i uvlači je u zamršene planove vrhunskoga špijuna Kurtza (Shannon). Charlie se upušta u zahtjevnu ulogu dvostruke agentice u "životnoj predstavi". No iako je prirodno nadarena za taj zadatak, neizbježno biva uvučena u opasni svijet dvoličnosti i kompromitirane ljudskosti. "Mala bubnjarica" isprepleće ljubav i mržnju, istinito i izmišljeno, ispravno i pogrešno te ispreda napetu i eksplozivnu priču o špijunaži i međunarodnim intrigama na najvišoj razini.</desc>

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence, Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator, while Verger places a $3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.\n\nThe sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Hollywood Singing And Dancing</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure: Directed by Mark McLaughlin. With Julie Andrews, Fred Astaire, Obba Babatundé, John Badham. HOLLYWOOD SINGING &amp; DANCING: A MUSICAL TREASURE is a celebration of song and dance, beginning with the Busby Berkeley films that lifted the spirits of audiences during the Great Depression, through the patriotic musicals of the 1940s and ending with the collapse of the studio system in the 1950s. Hosted by Academy Award winning stage, screen and television icon, Shirley Jones, this "docutainment" film is a grand historical look at the magic of musical Hollywood. Highlighted are amazing songs and dance numbers, little-known facts, and luminaries who made the magic possible such as Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Betty Grable, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, James Cagney, Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Donen, Frank Sinatra, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger. Mesmerizing sequences are interspersed with fresh new commentary by Liza Minnelli, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, Jane Russell, Rita Moreno, Pat Boone, Rob Marshall, Bill Condon, Shirley MacLaine, Tommy Tune, Joel Grey, Smokey Robinson, Patti Page, Tab Hunter, George Chakiris, Rhonda Fleming, Betty Garrett, Marge Champion, Joan Leslie, Robert Osborne, Stella Stevens, Gloria Stuart and others. FILMS INCLUDE: The Wizard of Oz, Dames, Fashions of 1934, The Little Colonel, Gold Diggers of 1935, Billboard Girl, Something to Sing About, Little Princess, Meet Me In St. Louis, Babes on Broadway, Yankee Doodle Dandy, On the Town, The Harvey Girls, Cover Girl, The King and I, An American In Paris, Singin' In The Rain, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Till the Clouds Roll By, Royal Wedding, Damn Yankees, Gigi, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Oklahoma!, Carousel and Chicago." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1147738/","name":"Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FmZjNlYmQtMjllNi00ZmZiLWEyNWUtZjE2ZWE5NTljYzE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDYxMTUwNg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"HOLLYWOOD SINGING &amp; DANCING: A MUSICAL TREASURE is a celebration of song and dance, beginning with the Busby Berkeley films that lifted the spirits of audiences during the Great Depression, through the patriotic musicals of the 1940s","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1147738/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"danddinmont"},"dateCreated":"2008-03-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"Does not compare favorably to "That's Entertainment" (Parts I thru III)","reviewBody":"Because this was shown during a PBS fund drive, and all the other "specials" that were being shown were more than five years old, I thought this show was another that had been dragged out of the archives. \n\nWhat a surprise, it's new!

No, it doesn't have as much substance, but it has its own childish charm.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":171546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-08-10","keywords":"frame up,scantily clad female,voyeur,voyeurism,football helmet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Longest Yard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi821428505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781842/","name":"Peter Segal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748665/","name":"Albert S.

The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the "Paul Verhovenesque" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.\n\nWhat is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, "Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.\n\nVing Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!\n\nHer character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.\n\nSince we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre, consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight, one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket, `I don't know why I'm bothering, I hate [rubbish] like this'.

The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the "Paul Verhovenesque" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.\n\nWhat is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, "Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.\n\nVing Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!\n\nHer character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.\n\nSince we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre, consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight, one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket, `I don't know why I'm bothering, I hate [rubbish] like this'. He was the one laughing the loudest and coming closest to vomiting throughout the film, and all of us came out saying, `how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..? Sarcastically - yes, but if it was nominated, it'd get my vote. The only thing that could have made it better was Steven Segal instead of Burt Reynolds but you can't have everything.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":248588,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror"],"datePublished":"2004-06-02","keywords":"survival horror,mall,nurse,shopping mall,zombie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Zack Snyder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1692647449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"From 'Dawn of the Dead' and '300' to 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' and 'Army of the Dead,' we break down the stunning visual trademarks of director Zack Snyder.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001631/","name":"Sarah Polley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001616/","name":"Mekhi Phifer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086710/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010962/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013658/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-03-08","keywords":"playing a board game,sibling rivalry,board game,two brothers,outer space","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Zathura","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1608712473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1501050/","name":"Jonah Bobo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1009277/","name":"Dax Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269463/","name":"Jon Favreau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885575/","name":"Chris Van Allsburg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436960/","name":"John Kamps"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is more intense than Da Vinci Code. I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels &amp; Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.\n\nThe story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought.

It is more intense than Da Vinci Code. I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels &amp; Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.\n\nThe story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought. The sets are amazing too.\n\nOverall: Fans of the book will flock the cinemas to catch this. Fans of the previous movie, Da Vinci Code, should also catch this.

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping.

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-03-08","keywords":"playing a board game,sibling rivalry,board game,two brothers,outer space","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Zathura","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1608712473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1501050/","name":"Jonah Bobo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1009277/","name":"Dax Shepard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269463/","name":"Jon Favreau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885575/","name":"Chris Van Allsburg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436960/","name":"John Kamps"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Major League Baseball is not just a game of money, but in "Moneyball" it's a game of numbers versus a game of people. It's callousness at its highest when general managers trade away people as if they're objects with little regard for them or their family. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland As, seems to take that even further, treating people as if they are only numbers, and yet there was something refreshing and humanistic about the whole thing.\n\nIt's 2001 and Oakland has just lost to the New York Yankees in the playoffs, not surprising, seeing as their payroll was 76 Million dollars less. The humour of "Moneyball" starts in the off-season when the team can't afford to keep their top players and Beane and his experienced scouts start tossing around some free agent ideas. One guy is no good because he frequents strip clubs too often, another guy is no good because his girlfriend is ugly, and on down the list they go. But then Beane meets Yale-educated, economics-, mathematics-, and computer-whiz, baseball fan, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). He has no experience and he doesn't know these players. He doesn't know if they stand funny or if they swing ugly. He only knows their stats and their salary. \n\nA lot of people took offense to Beane's approach of degrading players down to the sum total of their on-base percentage and runs-in potential. But I liked it. Since the game of baseball isn't changing any time soon and players will always just be elements that can help win games and make more money, why not view them as numbers rather than as people with ugly girlfriends? Like Peter Brand, I like numbers. \n\nIt's a movie about doing more with less, so I think we're just supposed to ignore the irony that they needed an excessively high budget to make it. In fact, it cost Sony Pictures more money to make this movie than it cost the Oakland A's to field their entire team for a season. Oh well, only one lesson for Hollywood at a time, and I still liked the movie.\n\nFor a movie about people trying to change the game of baseball, it's only fitting that they are changing the sports genre. This isn't about the team and how many games they're going to win. As in all cases, they win some and they lose some. And we really only meet one player, the rest are just names thrown in the air. The movie is about Billy Beane, a real person, and a multi-dimensional character. At first he realizes that he is going to have to play the game with more than just money, and then after he makes it about numbers too, he finds a balanced statistical and personal concept.\n\n"Moneyball" says that the game is about money, but the movie is about people. Writer Aaron Sorkin knows how to write people, and as evidenced by "The Social Network" (2010), he also knows how to turn computer-programming into riveting cinema. We find humour in the least-expected of places, we find heart in the least-expected of people, and 'Moneyball" gives us a completely enjoyable movie that becomes so much more than numbers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2011-09-23","keywords":"strategy,baseball,statistics,baseball movie,job offer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3229326361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1NDMxMTI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAzODY1Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1NDMxMTI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAzODY1Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) works to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing computer-generated analysis to draft his players."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000705/","name":"Robin Wright"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174505/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3133181/","name":"Stan Chervin"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Inferno"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169289,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2016-10-13","keywords":"amnesia,church,museum,police,virus","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi396539673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTEwNzc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNTUyOTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTEwNzc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNTUyOTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Robert Langdon wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia, he teams up with Sienna Brooks, a doctor he hopes will help him recover his memories.

Kreće od trenutka kad je Wolf pobjegao od Tiger i pratimo njegov munjevit uspon od skromnog slastičara do super kulinarske zvijezde '80-ih. Ali njegov je uspjeh gorko-slatkog okusa, jer je ostavio jedinu osobu s kojom je sve to najviše htio podijeliti: Tiger. U njegov je život ušla droga, zbog koje je i ostao bez života, u kojemu je bilo i novca i djevojaka, ali najviše mu je nedostajala ljubav.

Like every romantic farce, Up For Love (2016) is a comedy based on situational humour rather than dialogue or action. It's a genre that shows people revealing themselves by how they react to the unexpected and this one is funny and sad and loaded with charm.\n\nThe plot line is simple: a beautiful lawyer loses her phone and a caller offers to return it if she will dine with him. Freshly divorced Diane (Virginie Efira) is trying to move on and is vulnerable to the smooth-talking Alexandre (Jean Dujardin). When they first meet she is stunned to find that the high-profile architect is 4 foot 6 inches tall. It is a hilarious scene of studied avoidance and shifting glances. But they hit it off and start dating, and each situation into which Diane introduces Alexandre is a farcical study of how people react to his diminutive stature. Throughout it all, Alexandre endures the stares and jibes with good-humoured acceptance despite the callous insensitivity of people towards those who are different.\n\nThere is an unmistakable feeling of guilt in laughing at how Alexandre copes with everyday moments in his life, like needing to jump up into a normal size chair and see his dangling feet not reach the floor. But that is the whole point: how would we react in the situation? Dujardin is a pin-up star of French cinema and he plays here with irrepressible warmth and forbearance despite his short straw in life. Efira is his perfect match and plays middle-class embarrassment to perfection. Critics have complained that the digital effects to down-size Dujardin are clumsy. It is true that if you look for it, you can notice some between-scene differences in scale and perspective that slightly alters his size in relation to the frame. Just ignore it.

Like every romantic farce, Up For Love (2016) is a comedy based on situational humour rather than dialogue or action. It's a genre that shows people revealing themselves by how they react to the unexpected and this one is funny and sad and loaded with charm.\n\nThe plot line is simple: a beautiful lawyer loses her phone and a caller offers to return it if she will dine with him. Freshly divorced Diane (Virginie Efira) is trying to move on and is vulnerable to the smooth-talking Alexandre (Jean Dujardin). When they first meet she is stunned to find that the high-profile architect is 4 foot 6 inches tall. It is a hilarious scene of studied avoidance and shifting glances. But they hit it off and start dating, and each situation into which Diane introduces Alexandre is a farcical study of how people react to his diminutive stature. Throughout it all, Alexandre endures the stares and jibes with good-humoured acceptance despite the callous insensitivity of people towards those who are different.\n\nThere is an unmistakable feeling of guilt in laughing at how Alexandre copes with everyday moments in his life, like needing to jump up into a normal size chair and see his dangling feet not reach the floor. But that is the whole point: how would we react in the situation? Dujardin is a pin-up star of French cinema and he plays here with irrepressible warmth and forbearance despite his short straw in life. Efira is his perfect match and plays middle-class embarrassment to perfection. Critics have complained that the digital effects to down-size Dujardin are clumsy. It is true that if you look for it, you can notice some between-scene differences in scale and perspective that slightly alters his size in relation to the frame. Just ignore it. The whole of cinema involves suspension of disbelief and this story has more than enough going for it to be spoilt by minor hiccups with experimental technology.\n\nLove stories between mismatched souls have always been the lifeblood of romantic comedy, so in one sense Up For Love is just another take on an ancient theme. If your glass is always half empty, then this film is a flawed cliché. For others, it is a delightful romance that doubles as a serious essay on dealing with difference.

After having received a huge ransom for kidnapping a French millionaire in 1979, French authorities declared him 'Public Enemy Number One'. They increased their efforts to track Mesrine down, and executed him without a trial shortly afterwards. While imprisoned earlier on, Mesrine wrote his autobiography.\n\n'Public Enemy Number One - Part 1' reflects the first part of this criminal's adult life. Starting in the late fifties in Algeria, where French soldier Jacques Mesrine served in the foul war of independence, we get a clear picture of his development as a master-criminal.\n\nAlthough I think it difficult to judge the historical precision of its plot, this very French film surely makes a good watch.

After having received a huge ransom for kidnapping a French millionaire in 1979, French authorities declared him 'Public Enemy Number One'. They increased their efforts to track Mesrine down, and executed him without a trial shortly afterwards. While imprisoned earlier on, Mesrine wrote his autobiography.\n\n'Public Enemy Number One - Part 1' reflects the first part of this criminal's adult life. Starting in the late fifties in Algeria, where French soldier Jacques Mesrine served in the foul war of independence, we get a clear picture of his development as a master-criminal.\n\nAlthough I think it difficult to judge the historical precision of its plot, this very French film surely makes a good watch. Male lead Vincent Cassel acts a convincing Jacques Mesrine, and the many supporting roles shine with equal quality. The parts 1 and 2 of 'Public enemy Number One' provide a real blockbuster that sticks to the mind.\n\nFor the fans of Ludivine Sagnier.

While imprisoned earlier on, Mesrine wrote his autobiography.\n\n'Public Enemy Number One - Part 1' reflects the first part of this criminal's adult life. Starting in the late fifties in Algeria, where French soldier Jacques Mesrine served in the foul war of independence, we get a clear picture of his development as a master-criminal.\n\nAlthough I think it difficult to judge the historical precision of its plot, this very French film surely makes a good watch. Male lead Vincent Cassel acts a convincing Jacques Mesrine, and the many supporting roles shine with equal quality. The parts 1 and 2 of 'Public enemy Number One' provide a real blockbuster that sticks to the mind.\n\nFor the fans of Ludivine Sagnier. She isn't in this Part 1, but will appear in Part 2.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33257,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-10-22","keywords":"mesrine,gangster,prison,prison escape,1960s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mesrine: Killer Instinct -- U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3012298265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5OTg1ODgwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQyNjEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5OTg1ODgwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQyNjEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of french gangster Jacques Mesrine, before he was called Public Enemy NÂ°1."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0208426/","name":"Cécile de France"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724938/","name":"Jean-François Richet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006560/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097650/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0229884/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1626500/","name":"Jacques Mesrine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2022382/","name":"Abdel Raouf Dafri"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724938/","name":"Jean-François Richet"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What would on surface seem unfilmable is done with great sensitivity and honesty.\n\nCondon knows how to tell stories about real people (Gods and Monsters), and here is a life filled with curiosity and far reaching accomplishment.\n\nRaised in a repressed family dominated by a stern father, Kinsey is portrayed as an isolated teen who rebels against not only his father, but against sexual convention. As a science instructor in college, he meets a student who becomes his wife. As other students look more and more to him for sexual advice, his original interest in insect studies changes to sex adviser and ultimately sex researcher. His team of assistants and even their wives become involved in the research. As Kinsey's study requires sample interviews across the country, a diverse, amazing discovery of sexual habits and statistics are revealed. The study ultimately becomes published in a groundbreaking best seller amid a swell of damnation from the public.\n\nCondon interweaves the science with the human element in a very intelligent screenplay. It is remarkable that such a coherent storyline emerges from a multitude of scientific and news sources. The movie also says a lot about the state of the country at a time in mid twentieth century America when the Red Scare was in full swing and the populace was guided by the morals and sensibilities of its time. Kinsey's relationship with his wife is the thread that ties the film together thematically. She essentially becomes the barometer for his work and his shortcomings. Here is a man who was brilliant and at the same time fallible.\n\nThere is no epilogue at film's end as might be expected for a biography, but it is a nice touch for a film that tries to approach its subject with freshness and reverence. The set design and costumes are all authentic in period flavor, but the film seems to be focused not on marking the precise year but depicting an era or time. Do stay for the amusing end credits which show a veritable Noah's Ark of animals in their glory. \n\nLiam Neeson is very good as the obsessed scientist who tries to conduct meaningful, quantifiable research while reconciling the emotional toll on his marriage and his friendships. Laura Linney is in fine form as the supportive wife who observes and then participates in her husband's venture.\n\nAs his research assistants, Timothy Hutton, Chris O'Donnell, and Peter Sarsgaard round out a very strong ensemble cast. In fact, these fine actors are almost wasted in supporting roles. John Lithgow is pitch perfect as Kinsey's cruel, insensitive father. There is a nice, near cameo appearance by Lynn Redgrave (Gods and Monsters) as the last interview of Kinsey, and she resonates in her brief appearance.\n\nIn keeping with the subject matter, there is graphic dialogue and sexual depictions, but there is nothing exploitive or without narrative purpose here. It is interesting to note that this film is coming on the heels of a moralistic backlash of media content and permissiveness. By showing how well-intended human studies into formerly taboo subjects helped to enlighten and reexamine human behavior, Kinsey proves to be the right film for the right time."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"sexuality,character name as title,surname as title,lgbt plus,timeframe 1940s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kinsey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224292121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001473/","name":"Laura Linney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

By showing how well-intended human studies into formerly taboo subjects helped to enlighten and reexamine human behavior, Kinsey proves to be the right film for the right time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"sexuality,character name as title,surname as title,lgbt plus,timeframe 1940s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kinsey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224292121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001473/","name":"Laura Linney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.\n\nThe style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.\n\nEvery time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man.

He embarks on an adventure with a street-smart girl to discover how he came to be.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3922818/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"TVholic"},"dateCreated":"2019-08-11","inLanguage":"English","name":"Good sci-fi romance","reviewBody":"This movie was fine. It's no masterpiece, but I actually found it much more enjoyable than "The Martian," the vaunted 2015 Matt Damon vehicle. That may be somewhat more scientifically accurate - although it still had its share of errors - but it just used people as setpieces for the situation, with no real character development.\n\nI liked Asa Butterfield as the eponymous character in "Ender's Game," and he's just as good here. Before you tag me as an Asa fan, I didn't like him in Scorsese's "Hugo." Here, he was convincing as a Mars-born child with his childlike, guileless naiveté and tall, gangly build. One professional critic compared this with "Flight of the Navigator," but Gardner isn't the smartmouth kid like David was in that movie, and Asa is a far, far better actor than Joey Cramer was. Likewise Gary Oldman, some of whose roles I have detested (his Doctor Smith in the awful "Lost in Space") while others like his Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman movies were fine. The critics think he was over the top as billionaire mogul Nathaniel Shepard, but I found him to be a rather plausible mix of Steve Jobs' salesmanship, Elon Musk's arrogance and spaceflight ambitions, and Howard Hughes' fascination with flying and reclusive eccentricity.\n\nYou can tell that many of the movie's fiercest critics here have their own agendas, usually trying to prove they're smarter than the writer. All their comments do is reveal their closed minds and often their ignorance. One smart aleck claims Gardner's mother looked 5 months pregnant in the film. The shot where she peers out of the spacecraft window as she cradles her expanding belly was at an indeterminate time sometime after her sonogram two months after launch, possibly right before landing more than seven months after launch. Same person talks about Mars gravity being 2/3rd of Earth's. No, it's 1/3rd. Plus she complains that the Earth's resources are said to be depleted. That phrase was Nathaniel reading from a letter he wrote to the President as a 12-year-old, full of youthful enthusiasm and exaggeration, not stated as actual scientific fact. Another critic tries to look intelligent by saying Mars is four light minutes away. It is at its closest, but the distance isn't constant and is over 22 light minutes at its furthest. (Another genius here claims it's 90 light minutes each way.) The communication with Mars was instantaneous because they clearly plastered "QuantumCom light minute compression" on the comm screens to imply they've figured out how to use quantum entanglement for instant data transfer at interplanetary distances (still inplausible as it's based on a common misconception, but still far less fantastical than laser swords, warp drive, time travel, telepathy, teleportation devices or humanoid aliens attacking to steal our water, oxygen, etc.). Besides, it's a dramatic technique, as waiting minutes between messages with no realtime interaction just isn't very interesting, unless you liked "You've Got Mail." Another critic who claims to be an MD rated the movie 1 star for no other reason than they pronounced a test "TROponin" rather than "tropPOnin" as he preferred, even though the former is in fact the correct pronunciation, as any medical dictionary can confirm. I wouldn't want him as my doctor, or even playing one on TV. One complained that Gardner's mother was too young to be a mission commander, but probably never said the same about the similarly young Jessica Chastain in "The Martian." Another smart guy claimed the spacecraft would have accelerated halfway to Mars, providing gravity all the way, then turned around and decelerated. Anybody with a knowledge of physics would laugh him out of the room after telling him that would require several times more reaction mass (fuel) than the total mass of the entire spacecraft, a physical impossibility. One critic savages the movie for having contemporary products in it. It's a relatively low budget science fiction film, not a $400 million blockbuster. They spent their budget on more important things like CGI effects, spacecraft props, Mars sets and weightlessness effects, not wasting it creating an entire future Earth, and the projections in movies set in the near future like "2001" always turn out looking dated after a few years anyway. You get the idea; the criticisms are generally incredibly petty, nitpicky and often just plain wrong. I can see plenty of scientific and technological mistakes, especially the Dream Chaser spacecraft used at the end, which would need a large booster and a launchpad rather than taking off using its own small rocket engines from a runway. But I accept that this is a movie, not a documentary, and focus on the characters, whom I did like and care about.\n\nBasically, the critiques boil down to "it's for kids!" As someone approaching retirement age, I'd much rather be young at heart than cranky and old in the head.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-02-03","keywords":"astronaut,futuristic,space mission,nasa,high school student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4198413849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Mjg2NjYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNjMwMTI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Mjg2NjYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNjMwMTI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The first human born on Mars travels to Earth for the first time, experiencing the wonders of the planet through fresh eyes.

Playing a Vietnam vet, Vincent, who has seen better times, he parlays his drunkenness into opportunity. The film begins with him totally wasted, backing his car, an old woody convertible, over his picket fence. The next day, a couple of Hispanic movers bringing a middle aged woman (Melissa McCarthy) and her son to their new digs, damages a tree branch. Murray uses this to threaten her with a law suit unless she pays up. It's obvious that she doesn't have much money. It turns out that she and her son are escaping her husband, a philanderer, and the two are on the road to divorces. What ensues is a relationship that grows out of necessity as Murray is enlisted to look after the boy, Oliver, at significant cost to the mother. The kid now becomes a part of Murray's daily forays into irresponsibility: bars, horse track, joy riding, etc. He also brings the child to a hospital where his Alzheimers stricken wife lives. Murray is devoted to her, even though he has an ongoing thing with a Russian hooker, Naomi Watts, whom he may have impregnated. She has the heart of gold in a combative personality. The boy, Jaeden Liebehrer, is a gem of an actor. He has this fatalistic sense to him. He knows he will remain the perpetual victim, but when Vincent comes into his life, he begins to absorb tools to try to get by. Mom works sixteen hour shifts and has no idea of what goes on after Murray picks the boy up from school. What is heartening is that nothing is simple here. Murray continues his bad ways almost throughout, but we know he has a marshmallow center. With all the darkness in the world, give this one a shot.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99219,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-24","keywords":"stroke recovery,next door neighbor,grumpy old man,divorced parents,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1658236697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwMzA0MDk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk5ODIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwMzA0MDk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk5ODIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a trailer for St. Vincent featuring new music by Wilco's Jeff Tweedy."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000195/","name":"Bill Murray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0577647/","name":"Theodore Melfi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0025116/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072737/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0577647/","name":"Theodore Melfi"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Playing a Vietnam vet, Vincent, who has seen better times, he parlays his drunkenness into opportunity. The film begins with him totally wasted, backing his car, an old woody convertible, over his picket fence. The next day, a couple of Hispanic movers bringing a middle aged woman (Melissa McCarthy) and her son to their new digs, damages a tree branch. Murray uses this to threaten her with a law suit unless she pays up. It's obvious that she doesn't have much money. It turns out that she and her son are escaping her husband, a philanderer, and the two are on the road to divorces. What ensues is a relationship that grows out of necessity as Murray is enlisted to look after the boy, Oliver, at significant cost to the mother.

It's no masterpiece, but I actually found it much more enjoyable than "The Martian," the vaunted 2015 Matt Damon vehicle. That may be somewhat more scientifically accurate - although it still had its share of errors - but it just used people as setpieces for the situation, with no real character development.\n\nI liked Asa Butterfield as the eponymous character in "Ender's Game," and he's just as good here. Before you tag me as an Asa fan, I didn't like him in Scorsese's "Hugo." Here, he was convincing as a Mars-born child with his childlike, guileless naiveté and tall, gangly build. One professional critic compared this with "Flight of the Navigator," but Gardner isn't the smartmouth kid like David was in that movie, and Asa is a far, far better actor than Joey Cramer was. Likewise Gary Oldman, some of whose roles I have detested (his Doctor Smith in the awful "Lost in Space") while others like his Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman movies were fine. The critics think he was over the top as billionaire mogul Nathaniel Shepard, but I found him to be a rather plausible mix of Steve Jobs' salesmanship, Elon Musk's arrogance and spaceflight ambitions, and Howard Hughes' fascination with flying and reclusive eccentricity.\n\nYou can tell that many of the movie's fiercest critics here have their own agendas, usually trying to prove they're smarter than the writer. All their comments do is reveal their closed minds and often their ignorance. One smart aleck claims Gardner's mother looked 5 months pregnant in the film. The shot where she peers out of the spacecraft window as she cradles her expanding belly was at an indeterminate time sometime after her sonogram two months after launch, possibly right before landing more than seven months after launch. Same person talks about Mars gravity being 2/3rd of Earth's. No, it's 1/3rd. Plus she complains that the Earth's resources are said to be depleted. That phrase was Nathaniel reading from a letter he wrote to the President as a 12-year-old, full of youthful enthusiasm and exaggeration, not stated as actual scientific fact. Another critic tries to look intelligent by saying Mars is four light minutes away. It is at its closest, but the distance isn't constant and is over 22 light minutes at its furthest. (Another genius here claims it's 90 light minutes each way.) The communication with Mars was instantaneous because they clearly plastered "QuantumCom light minute compression" on the comm screens to imply they've figured out how to use quantum entanglement for instant data transfer at interplanetary distances (still inplausible as it's based on a common misconception, but still far less fantastical than laser swords, warp drive, time travel, telepathy, teleportation devices or humanoid aliens attacking to steal our water, oxygen, etc.). Besides, it's a dramatic technique, as waiting minutes between messages with no realtime interaction just isn't very interesting, unless you liked "You've Got Mail." Another critic who claims to be an MD rated the movie 1 star for no other reason than they pronounced a test "TROponin" rather than "tropPOnin" as he preferred, even though the former is in fact the correct pronunciation, as any medical dictionary can confirm. I wouldn't want him as my doctor, or even playing one on TV. One complained that Gardner's mother was too young to be a mission commander, but probably never said the same about the similarly young Jessica Chastain in "The Martian." Another smart guy claimed the spacecraft would have accelerated halfway to Mars, providing gravity all the way, then turned around and decelerated. Anybody with a knowledge of physics would laugh him out of the room after telling him that would require several times more reaction mass (fuel) than the total mass of the entire spacecraft, a physical impossibility. One critic savages the movie for having contemporary products in it. It's a relatively low budget science fiction film, not a $400 million blockbuster. They spent their budget on more important things like CGI effects, spacecraft props, Mars sets and weightlessness effects, not wasting it creating an entire future Earth, and the projections in movies set in the near future like "2001" always turn out looking dated after a few years anyway. You get the idea; the criticisms are generally incredibly petty, nitpicky and often just plain wrong. I can see plenty of scientific and technological mistakes, especially the Dream Chaser spacecraft used at the end, which would need a large booster and a launchpad rather than taking off using its own small rocket engines from a runway. But I accept that this is a movie, not a documentary, and focus on the characters, whom I did like and care about.\n\nBasically, the critiques boil down to "it's for kids!" As someone approaching retirement age, I'd much rather be young at heart than cranky and old in the head.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-02-03","keywords":"astronaut,futuristic,space mission,nasa,high school student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4198413849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Mjg2NjYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNjMwMTI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Mjg2NjYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNjMwMTI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The first human born on Mars travels to Earth for the first time, experiencing the wonders of the planet through fresh eyes.

Craig Zahler, who also wrote this gruesome, filthy western of how wild the west can really get. More so impressive that the whole film was shot in just 21 days. \n\nAn outlaw drifter wanders into the town of Bright Hope unknowingly leading a tribe of savage, inbred, natives better known as Troglodytes which translates as Cave-dweller." During the night, these horrific abominations murder and kidnap some of the town folk, one being the wife of a crippled rancher, who then embarks on a rescue mission with the town sheriff, his old and incapable deputy and an over confident gunslinger. \n\nKurt Russell heads up the rescue posse as Sheriff Hunt, slipping comfortably into his western boots. Richard Jenkins plays his ageing deputy, Patrick Wilson the limping, desperate rancher and an impressive Matthew Fox who stole the screen, as the charismatic, narcissistic know-it- all who both annoying yet strangely likable, reminding me a little of Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. \n\nThere's an air of mystery for the majority of the film, keeping the audience on tender hooks waiting to see what's in store for the rescue party. Are the kidnapped still alive? Dead? Or worse? While some elements are left to your imagination, you can only think of the worse, but what isn't, is nothing short of disturbing.\n\nThe gory violence is shocking to watch, even just hearing the graphic noises is enough. The sound is gruesome, bloody and unsettling. The climatic end was actually painful to watch, scarring the memory making me shudder just at the thought of it. The lack of a score only intensifies the haunting atmosphere. \n\nSomething has to be said for the special effects, make-up and the sound engineering that were all completely on point. I've never seen a more gory western, even more so than The Hateful Eight. The makeup and effects throughout are amazing but they really go beyond during the epic climax. \n\nThere's been a few disturbing films this year, visually, Neon Demon and imagination wise, Nocturnal Animals springing to mind but this one really made me wrench covering my mouth with both hands. It's like those good horrors you're too scared to watch but find yourself mesmerised to the screen regardless. This is certainly not one for the weak stomached.

We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation.

We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":577129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-01-10","keywords":"loneliness,romance with artificial intelligence,divorce,future,artificial intelligence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4112492569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":" A lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.

We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation.

We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":577129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-01-10","keywords":"loneliness,romance with artificial intelligence,divorce,future,artificial intelligence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4112492569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":" A lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.

Big, loud, and hilarious","reviewBody":"Once again, Arnie and Cameron team up to deliver a terrific action film.\n\nArnie stars as a secret agent posing as a computer salesman. Not even his wife knows his true identity and since he is always busy she decides to have a little excitement and hooks up with a nitwit posing as a secret agent! In the mean while, in trying to get her back, Arnie gets his family inadvertently pushed into a plot, by terrorists to nuke the USA! Preposterous? Yes! Hilarious? YES!!!\n\nThe resulting film has Arnie chasing motorcycles on horseback through hotels all the way to "borrowing" Harrier jets from the military. And, of course, getting his wife and daughter back.\n\nPacked with awesome action scenes and some really terrific hilarious moments this is what an action movie should be. Not too serious and not too pointless. 8/10\n\nRated R: violence and profanity","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":250244,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"],"duration":"PT2H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gustave Flaubert's novel was so rich, undulating that any adaptation in images can only be reducing and simplistic. More than the tragic story of its heroine, Flaubert's novel encompassed a word picture of Normandy (the bulk of the film was shot in the village of Lyons-La-Forêt near Rouen) and a cruel, cynical vision of the world. If the first feature is satisfying on the screen, the second one is hardly perceptible. Hence, this crucial question: is it possible to fully recreate Flaubert's novel? Chabrol's film is faithful to the main plot with the rise and fall of her heroine sometimes told by François Périer's voice-over in spite of accelerated views on certain vital episodes, notably the peasant marriage that disgusted Emma Bovary. On the other hand, the crest of the novel (the ball to the marquis) found a perfect equivalent in Chabrol's film with this shot which goes through the turning dresses creating thus a whirlpool. The glittering life Emma dreams of instead of a dull one with her mediocre husband Charles.\n\nChabrol is buoyed by topnotch interpretations. Even if Isabelle Huppert is a convincing Emma Bovary, a woman whose messy dreams and follies badly conceal boredom and disgust of her condition, the other main actors steal the show with Jean-François Balmer as the perfect, narrow-minded Charles Bovary, Christophe Malavoy as unfaithful Rodolphe Boulanger and Jean Yanne as the unscrupulous chemist Homais.\n\n"Madame Bovary" is aesthetically a refined work with lush scenery and lavish costumes that recreate rural life in Normandy in the middle of the nineteenth Century. But Chabrol doesn't break new ground with this adaptation that required something else than an elegant directing, a brilliant cast and splendid scenery. That's why his rendering of Flaubert's work is just an honorable reading of the novel in the end. One could also add that Flaubert's book was a solid opportunity for an onslaught at provincial lower middle class. But it's only skimmed over and it's a wasted bonanza.\n\nChabrol's reading of "Madame Bovary" amounts to the same result as Claude Berri's adaptation of Emile Zola's epic novel "Germinal" in 1993: honorable instead of being unforgettable, a commendable action instead of a ground-breaking creation. The author of "le Boucher" (1970) was rather on the wrong track but fortunately, he'll find his way again the following year with another woman depiction: "Betty" (1992). Georges Simenon's universe suits him much better than Flaubert's one.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3885,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1991-04-03","keywords":"character name as title,emma bovary character,period drama,quoting alphonse de lamartine,wedding","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Madame Bovary (1991)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3198616345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY4NDQ3ZjItNDY2OC00NWM5LTg4ZDMtZDczNmIxNWJlZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY4NDQ3ZjItNDY2OC00NWM5LTg4ZDMtZDczNmIxNWJlZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Samuel Goldwyn"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0050983/","name":"Jean-François Balmer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0539022/","name":"Christophe Malavoy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022545/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055736/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0254873/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281306/","name":"Gustave Flaubert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"}],"duration":"PT2H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gustave Flaubert's novel was so rich, undulating that any adaptation in images can only be reducing and simplistic. More than the tragic story of its heroine, Flaubert's novel encompassed a word picture of Normandy (the bulk of the film was shot in the village of Lyons-La-Forêt near Rouen) and a cruel, cynical vision of the world. If the first feature is satisfying on the screen, the second one is hardly perceptible. Hence, this crucial question: is it possible to fully recreate Flaubert's novel? Chabrol's film is faithful to the main plot with the rise and fall of her heroine sometimes told by François Périer's voice-over in spite of accelerated views on certain vital episodes, notably the peasant marriage that disgusted Emma Bovary. On the other hand, the crest of the novel (the ball to the marquis) found a perfect equivalent in Chabrol's film with this shot which goes through the turning dresses creating thus a whirlpool. The glittering life Emma dreams of instead of a dull one with her mediocre husband Charles.\n\nChabrol is buoyed by topnotch interpretations. Even if Isabelle Huppert is a convincing Emma Bovary, a woman whose messy dreams and follies badly conceal boredom and disgust of her condition, the other main actors steal the show with Jean-François Balmer as the perfect, narrow-minded Charles Bovary, Christophe Malavoy as unfaithful Rodolphe Boulanger and Jean Yanne as the unscrupulous chemist Homais.\n\n"Madame Bovary" is aesthetically a refined work with lush scenery and lavish costumes that recreate rural life in Normandy in the middle of the nineteenth Century. But Chabrol doesn't break new ground with this adaptation that required something else than an elegant directing, a brilliant cast and splendid scenery. That's why his rendering of Flaubert's work is just an honorable reading of the novel in the end. One could also add that Flaubert's book was a solid opportunity for an onslaught at provincial lower middle class. But it's only skimmed over and it's a wasted bonanza.\n\nChabrol's reading of "Madame Bovary" amounts to the same result as Claude Berri's adaptation of Emile Zola's epic novel "Germinal" in 1993: honorable instead of being unforgettable, a commendable action instead of a ground-breaking creation. The author of "le Boucher" (1970) was rather on the wrong track but fortunately, he'll find his way again the following year with another woman depiction: "Betty" (1992). Georges Simenon's universe suits him much better than Flaubert's one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3885,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1991-04-03","keywords":"character name as title,emma bovary character,period drama,quoting alphonse de lamartine,wedding","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Madame Bovary (1991)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3198616345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY4NDQ3ZjItNDY2OC00NWM5LTg4ZDMtZDczNmIxNWJlZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY4NDQ3ZjItNDY2OC00NWM5LTg4ZDMtZDczNmIxNWJlZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Samuel Goldwyn","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0050983/","name":"Jean-François Balmer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0539022/","name":"Christophe Malavoy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055736/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0254873/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281306/","name":"Gustave Flaubert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"],"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially "Tommy Atkins") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or "The Lion And The Unicorn".\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering "what are we doing here?". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as "the scum of the earth" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money.

The twist was pretty predicable too but whatever, I've come to the realization that remakes are never as good as the originals.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11460,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2020-10-28","keywords":"witch,witchcraft,high school student,mexican american,blumhouse productions","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Now on Prime Video Cinema","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2648883481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFlZjE0YWMtYzI5ZC00YWFhLWFlNmYtZGQxNmY2MmUwZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFlZjE0YWMtYzI5ZC00YWFhLWFlNmYtZGQxNmY2MmUwZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A newcomer to a Catholic prep high school falls in with a trio of outcast teenage girls who practice witchcraft, and they all soon conjure up various spells and curses against those who anger them.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8314228/","name":"Cailee Spaeny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10656367/","name":"Zoey Luna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4594069/","name":"Gideon Adlon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830380/","name":"Zoe Lister-Jones"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098315/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093794/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830380/","name":"Zoe Lister-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276823/","name":"Peter Filardi"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Dok rješava zločine, dr. Blake sluša tajne i laži svojih pacijenata i pomaže im da unesu mir i pravdu u svoje živote. Blake je obrazovan, proputovao je svijet i vidio najgore što ljudi mogu učiniti jedni drugima. Nakon studija u Škotskoj, dr. Blake je kao vojni ljekar u britanskoj vojsci služio na Dalekom istoku tokom Drugoga svjetskog rata. Bez znanja porodice oženio se Kineskinjom s kojom je dobio dijete. U doba pada Singapura izgubili su kontakt. Na kraju duge i neuspješne potrage za suprugom i djetetom, dr. Blake se vraća u rodni Ballarat, kako bi preuzeo praksu od svog oca na samrti. Progone ga uspomene na ratne užase, zatočeništvo u zloglasnom logoru u Tajlandu i njegov lični gubitak. U javnosti dr. Blake je moralni kompas zajednice, dok je privatno čovjek koji iz prve ruke zna kako ljudi mogu biti nečovječni prema drugima. Rijetki razumiju njegov vragolasti humor i mogu probiti njegov psihološki oklop. Čak ni njegova odana asistentica Jean ponekad nema strpljenja za Dr. Blakea.</desc>

Opposites attract. Oil and water. Fire and ice...you know the drill. The problem is that when you have a pairing that mixes snappy patter and grudgingly mutual admiration with just a touch of sexual tension, the recipe is only going to be as good as the charisma of the two leads involved, whether it's a sitcom, dramedy or police procedural. \n\nCASTLE wants to be a mix of all three, and fortunately one of the most valuable weapons in its arsenal is the rakish charm of its featured lead actor, former FIREFLY star Nathan Fillion. I can count the number of actors on one hand who can pull off the "charming rascal" vibe in a way that never gets old, and Nathan can do those guys in his sleep. (And probably has.)\n\nBut he also knows how to modulate them as the occasion warrants, and where in his former role as Captain Mal Reynolds he could definitely play the bad-ass card when needed, here as womanizing bad-boy, party animal and bestselling novelist Rick Castle, he's a whole lot less serious. Bored with the cop character who has been his bread-and-butter for a string of chart-busting crime thrillers, Rick has decided in his latest tome to blow his hero's brains out, thus making a continuance of the series a little difficult to say the least. It wouldn't be a problem if the laid-back Lothario weren't suddenly faced with a major case of writer's block. But inspiration is coming in the most fortuitous if unlikely of ways. \n\nA serial killer has decided to rehash some of the more gruesome deaths from Castle's earlier novels, and it's up to the very attractive (of course!) and no-nonsense detective Kate Beckett (newcomer Stana Katic) to crack the case...which of course will require the assistance of a certain writer of whose books Detective Beckett is a closet fan. But a fan of smart-alecky guys who like to make very unsubtle passes at her? Not so much. Let the games and one-upmanship begin!\n\nAt first blush, you could easily accuse CASTLE of trying too hard, especially since matched with the seasoned experience of Fillion, the jury was out on Katic's ability to keep up with him in the first few episodes (at least it was for me.) And to enhance its credibility, the pilot even threw in some heavy hitters in guest cameos - James Patterson, no stranger himself to the crime fiction genre, and Stephen J. Cannell, who used to crank out pilots for series just like CASTLE over breakfast. \n\nBut creator Andrew Marlowe left nothing to chance with this one, knowing full well that no matter how great a character is, he's nothing without a good backstory and some fascinating support players. Here these come in the form of Rick Castle's teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn), whom of course is the real 'adult' in their relationship - probably her way of rebelling against her lovable father who nevertheless lives the lifestyle of a guy half his age, and their temporary roommate who also happens to be his mother, former stage and screen star Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan in a turn that makes Shirley MacLaine in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE look like a dowdy matron). Once you meet Martha, suddenly Rick's personality makes perfect sense. \n\nAs with any new series, this one will take some time to really settle into the groove it needs to capture a wider audience, but with the growing ease of the push-and-pull relationship between Fillion and Katic's characters, it could very well become the next "MOONLIGHTING" or "REMINGTON STEELE"...which wouldn't be a bad thing. Crime procedurals have been missing that fun element of late, and CASTLE could very well bring it back, without having to resort to a less-successful springboard of surrealism to build from (sorry, LIFE ON MARS).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

I liked the way it was filmed and directed. A good story, the script was tight, the actors very good and I engaged well in their characters. None of them were particularly likable either. I loved the sound track too, some great tunes. A shock for me was the ending, last 10 minutes.

Opposites attract. Oil and water. Fire and ice...you know the drill. The problem is that when you have a pairing that mixes snappy patter and grudgingly mutual admiration with just a touch of sexual tension, the recipe is only going to be as good as the charisma of the two leads involved, whether it's a sitcom, dramedy or police procedural. \n\nCASTLE wants to be a mix of all three, and fortunately one of the most valuable weapons in its arsenal is the rakish charm of its featured lead actor, former FIREFLY star Nathan Fillion. I can count the number of actors on one hand who can pull off the "charming rascal" vibe in a way that never gets old, and Nathan can do those guys in his sleep. (And probably has.)\n\nBut he also knows how to modulate them as the occasion warrants, and where in his former role as Captain Mal Reynolds he could definitely play the bad-ass card when needed, here as womanizing bad-boy, party animal and bestselling novelist Rick Castle, he's a whole lot less serious. Bored with the cop character who has been his bread-and-butter for a string of chart-busting crime thrillers, Rick has decided in his latest tome to blow his hero's brains out, thus making a continuance of the series a little difficult to say the least. It wouldn't be a problem if the laid-back Lothario weren't suddenly faced with a major case of writer's block. But inspiration is coming in the most fortuitous if unlikely of ways. \n\nA serial killer has decided to rehash some of the more gruesome deaths from Castle's earlier novels, and it's up to the very attractive (of course!) and no-nonsense detective Kate Beckett (newcomer Stana Katic) to crack the case...which of course will require the assistance of a certain writer of whose books Detective Beckett is a closet fan. But a fan of smart-alecky guys who like to make very unsubtle passes at her? Not so much. Let the games and one-upmanship begin!\n\nAt first blush, you could easily accuse CASTLE of trying too hard, especially since matched with the seasoned experience of Fillion, the jury was out on Katic's ability to keep up with him in the first few episodes (at least it was for me.) And to enhance its credibility, the pilot even threw in some heavy hitters in guest cameos - James Patterson, no stranger himself to the crime fiction genre, and Stephen J. Cannell, who used to crank out pilots for series just like CASTLE over breakfast. \n\nBut creator Andrew Marlowe left nothing to chance with this one, knowing full well that no matter how great a character is, he's nothing without a good backstory and some fascinating support players. Here these come in the form of Rick Castle's teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn), whom of course is the real 'adult' in their relationship - probably her way of rebelling against her lovable father who nevertheless lives the lifestyle of a guy half his age, and their temporary roommate who also happens to be his mother, former stage and screen star Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan in a turn that makes Shirley MacLaine in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE look like a dowdy matron). Once you meet Martha, suddenly Rick's personality makes perfect sense. \n\nAs with any new series, this one will take some time to really settle into the groove it needs to capture a wider audience, but with the growing ease of the push-and-pull relationship between Fillion and Katic's characters, it could very well become the next "MOONLIGHTING" or "REMINGTON STEELE"...which wouldn't be a bad thing. Crime procedurals have been missing that fun element of late, and CASTLE could very well bring it back, without having to resort to a less-successful springboard of surrealism to build from (sorry, LIFE ON MARS).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

    <desc lang="hr">Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) mogu vam ispričati sve što vas zanima o kvantnoj fizici, no rješavanje najjednostavnijih stvari iz svakodnevnog života potpuna im je zagonetka. Oni su bez sumnje genijalni, no zašto im je onda tako teško prići ljepšem spolu? Uz pomoć Kaley Cuoco, prijatelji će naučiti najvažniju životnu lekciju!Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) mogu vam ispričati sve što vas zanima o kvantnoj fizici, no rješavanje najjednostavnijih stvari iz svakodnevnog života potpuna je zagonetka dvojici prijatelja. Oni su briljantni fizičari koji mogu shvatiti kako svemir funkcionira, no kako komunicirati s ljudima, osobito djevojkama, potpuni im je misterij. To se počinje mijenjati kada se Penny (Kaley Cuoco) doseli u njihovo susjedstvo. I dok je Sheldon sretan sa svojim disfunkcionalnim prijateljima Wolowitzom (Simon Helberg) i Koothrappalijem (Kunal Nayyar), Leonard u Penny vidi šansu za romansom.</desc>

But inspiration is coming in the most fortuitous if unlikely of ways. \n\nA serial killer has decided to rehash some of the more gruesome deaths from Castle's earlier novels, and it's up to the very attractive (of course!) and no-nonsense detective Kate Beckett (newcomer Stana Katic) to crack the case...which of course will require the assistance of a certain writer of whose books Detective Beckett is a closet fan. But a fan of smart-alecky guys who like to make very unsubtle passes at her? Not so much. Let the games and one-upmanship begin!\n\nAt first blush, you could easily accuse CASTLE of trying too hard, especially since matched with the seasoned experience of Fillion, the jury was out on Katic's ability to keep up with him in the first few episodes (at least it was for me.) And to enhance its credibility, the pilot even threw in some heavy hitters in guest cameos - James Patterson, no stranger himself to the crime fiction genre, and Stephen J. Cannell, who used to crank out pilots for series just like CASTLE over breakfast. \n\nBut creator Andrew Marlowe left nothing to chance with this one, knowing full well that no matter how great a character is, he's nothing without a good backstory and some fascinating support players. Here these come in the form of Rick Castle's teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn), whom of course is the real 'adult' in their relationship - probably her way of rebelling against her lovable father who nevertheless lives the lifestyle of a guy half his age, and their temporary roommate who also happens to be his mother, former stage and screen star Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan in a turn that makes Shirley MacLaine in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE look like a dowdy matron). Once you meet Martha, suddenly Rick's personality makes perfect sense. \n\nAs with any new series, this one will take some time to really settle into the groove it needs to capture a wider audience, but with the growing ease of the push-and-pull relationship between Fillion and Katic's characters, it could very well become the next "MOONLIGHTING" or "REMINGTON STEELE"...which wouldn't be a bad thing. Crime procedurals have been missing that fun element of late, and CASTLE could very well bring it back, without having to resort to a less-successful springboard of surrealism to build from (sorry, LIFE ON MARS).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

Opposites attract. Oil and water. Fire and ice...you know the drill. The problem is that when you have a pairing that mixes snappy patter and grudgingly mutual admiration with just a touch of sexual tension, the recipe is only going to be as good as the charisma of the two leads involved, whether it's a sitcom, dramedy or police procedural. \n\nCASTLE wants to be a mix of all three, and fortunately one of the most valuable weapons in its arsenal is the rakish charm of its featured lead actor, former FIREFLY star Nathan Fillion. I can count the number of actors on one hand who can pull off the "charming rascal" vibe in a way that never gets old, and Nathan can do those guys in his sleep. (And probably has.)\n\nBut he also knows how to modulate them as the occasion warrants, and where in his former role as Captain Mal Reynolds he could definitely play the bad-ass card when needed, here as womanizing bad-boy, party animal and bestselling novelist Rick Castle, he's a whole lot less serious. Bored with the cop character who has been his bread-and-butter for a string of chart-busting crime thrillers, Rick has decided in his latest tome to blow his hero's brains out, thus making a continuance of the series a little difficult to say the least. It wouldn't be a problem if the laid-back Lothario weren't suddenly faced with a major case of writer's block. But inspiration is coming in the most fortuitous if unlikely of ways. \n\nA serial killer has decided to rehash some of the more gruesome deaths from Castle's earlier novels, and it's up to the very attractive (of course!) and no-nonsense detective Kate Beckett (newcomer Stana Katic) to crack the case...which of course will require the assistance of a certain writer of whose books Detective Beckett is a closet fan. But a fan of smart-alecky guys who like to make very unsubtle passes at her? Not so much.

Opposites attract. Oil and water. Fire and ice...you know the drill. The problem is that when you have a pairing that mixes snappy patter and grudgingly mutual admiration with just a touch of sexual tension, the recipe is only going to be as good as the charisma of the two leads involved, whether it's a sitcom, dramedy or police procedural. \n\nCASTLE wants to be a mix of all three, and fortunately one of the most valuable weapons in its arsenal is the rakish charm of its featured lead actor, former FIREFLY star Nathan Fillion. I can count the number of actors on one hand who can pull off the "charming rascal" vibe in a way that never gets old, and Nathan can do those guys in his sleep. (And probably has.)\n\nBut he also knows how to modulate them as the occasion warrants, and where in his former role as Captain Mal Reynolds he could definitely play the bad-ass card when needed, here as womanizing bad-boy, party animal and bestselling novelist Rick Castle, he's a whole lot less serious. Bored with the cop character who has been his bread-and-butter for a string of chart-busting crime thrillers, Rick has decided in his latest tome to blow his hero's brains out, thus making a continuance of the series a little difficult to say the least. It wouldn't be a problem if the laid-back Lothario weren't suddenly faced with a major case of writer's block. But inspiration is coming in the most fortuitous if unlikely of ways. \n\nA serial killer has decided to rehash some of the more gruesome deaths from Castle's earlier novels, and it's up to the very attractive (of course!) and no-nonsense detective Kate Beckett (newcomer Stana Katic) to crack the case...which of course will require the assistance of a certain writer of whose books Detective Beckett is a closet fan. But a fan of smart-alecky guys who like to make very unsubtle passes at her? Not so much. Let the games and one-upmanship begin!\n\nAt first blush, you could easily accuse CASTLE of trying too hard, especially since matched with the seasoned experience of Fillion, the jury was out on Katic's ability to keep up with him in the first few episodes (at least it was for me.) And to enhance its credibility, the pilot even threw in some heavy hitters in guest cameos - James Patterson, no stranger himself to the crime fiction genre, and Stephen J. Cannell, who used to crank out pilots for series just like CASTLE over breakfast. \n\nBut creator Andrew Marlowe left nothing to chance with this one, knowing full well that no matter how great a character is, he's nothing without a good backstory and some fascinating support players.

In the age of fake news and criminal media, advanced propaganda and lots people living in bubbles, it is perhaps refreshing to understand how weird YOU might look to an outsider. This movie can help with that, among other things. As all great art, it will make you think. Highly original and not easy to forget.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":90905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-11-11","keywords":"overprotective father,misuse of language,isolated house,child abuse,social isolation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Yorgos Lanthimos","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi998160921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE0ODVhZTQtZDJlYS00NmRjLWI2ZTItODE0YTgwODhlOTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE0ODVhZTQtZDJlYS00NmRjLWI2ZTItODE0YTgwODhlOTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"Awkward adults, dark humor, and absurd circumstances: Welcome to the films of Yorgos Lanthimos.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-06","keywords":"car,car movie,route 66,truck,tow truck","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460146/","name":"Jorgen Klubien"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-06","keywords":"car,car movie,route 66,truck,tow truck","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460146/","name":"Jorgen Klubien"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled. I am aware it's only entertainment. However it's entertainment in a true and realistic form.\n\nOne of the Best Shows on TV.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50700,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-10-10","keywords":"fire department,firefighter,rescue,rescue team,coworker relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1978325/","name":"Taylor Kinney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831601/","name":"Christian Stolte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0907708/","name":"Eamonn Walker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104973/","name":"Michael Brandt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351929/","name":"Derek Haas"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1918481177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Get a first look at Season 4 of "Chicago Fire.""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me. However, when Chicago PD was introduced, I decided to watch it because it came on directly after my favorite show and I love TV drama series. I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.\n\nWhen Chicago Fire crossed over with Chicago PD recently, I was forced to watch Chicago Fire. Hummm, Chicago Fire very interesting and exciting I thought. I went to HBO On Demand and watched Season 2 of Chicago Fire. Let me tell you, I didn't cook, I didn't answer my phone, I ordered food delivery service and didn't move off of my sofa(only for bbreak) until I watched every episode. I then went to a local retail store and bought Season 1 and the disconnect from the world started all over again. By now you know where my review is going.\n\nWatching Chicago Fire help me to understand Detective Voight, Dawson etc.. and how Chicago PD was piloted. I was upset with me for not watching Chicago Fire initially. Readers, to understand Chicago PD, you have to watch Chicago Fire. I love the intertwining of the shows. It is so damn interesting.\n\nChicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled.

Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me. However, when Chicago PD was introduced, I decided to watch it because it came on directly after my favorite show and I love TV drama series. I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.\n\nWhen Chicago Fire crossed over with Chicago PD recently, I was forced to watch Chicago Fire. Hummm, Chicago Fire very interesting and exciting I thought. I went to HBO On Demand and watched Season 2 of Chicago Fire. Let me tell you, I didn't cook, I didn't answer my phone, I ordered food delivery service and didn't move off of my sofa(only for bbreak) until I watched every episode. I then went to a local retail store and bought Season 1 and the disconnect from the world started all over again. By now you know where my review is going.\n\nWatching Chicago Fire help me to understand Detective Voight, Dawson etc.. and how Chicago PD was piloted. I was upset with me for not watching Chicago Fire initially. Readers, to understand Chicago PD, you have to watch Chicago Fire. I love the intertwining of the shows. It is so damn interesting.\n\nChicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled. I am aware it's only entertainment. However it's entertainment in a true and realistic form.\n\nOne of the Best Shows on TV.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50700,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-10-10","keywords":"fire department,firefighter,rescue,rescue team,coworker relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1978325/","name":"Taylor Kinney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831601/","name":"Christian Stolte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0907708/","name":"Eamonn Walker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104973/","name":"Michael Brandt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351929/","name":"Derek Haas"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1918481177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Get a first look at Season 4 of "Chicago Fire.""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They're taught how to kill.\n\nAnd we're shown again and again the CIA assassinating people, causing civil unrest, authorising explosions, arranging murders. The film makes no apologies for this but implies that for the good of the free world, well someone has to do it. Spy Game certainly surfs sweetly on American patriotism.\n\nSpy Game is predictably interesting though mainly because of Robert Redford who still has that million dollar smile and Brad Pitt who mixes boyish charm with a slight degree of angst.\n\nTony Scott's film making style however really needs to slow down. Relentless pace and swooping cameras are eventually tiring and they don't give time to contemplate. Still, Spy Game is slick and informative.

The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is "universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.\n\nFirst, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt Damon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.\n\nI won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.\n\nIt seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard.\n\nGood) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":620424,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-08-08","keywords":"memory,dark past,flashback,blockbuster,surprise ending","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1183149/","name":"Edgar Ramírez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000260/","name":"Joan Allen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339030/","name":"Paul Greengrass"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221156/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006904/","name":"Tony Gilroy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1994243/","name":"Scott Z.

The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is "universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.\n\nFirst, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt Damon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.\n\nI won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.\n\nIt seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard.\n\nGood) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":620424,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-08-08","keywords":"memory,dark past,flashback,blockbuster,surprise ending","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1183149/","name":"Edgar Ramírez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000260/","name":"Joan Allen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339030/","name":"Paul Greengrass"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221156/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006904/","name":"Tony Gilroy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1994243/","name":"Scott Z.

I love to watch a good chic-flick. However, I was so disappointed. This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater.

I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman.

And if that's not enough to put you off watching it, I don't know what is. Game adaptations don't have the best cinematic reputation out there. In fact, I can't think of a single decent one off the top of my head; the one that springs to mind foremost in relation to this film is the 2007 film Hit-man, which turned out to be very poor indeed. Max Payne isn't quite that bad, but it is a trite and predictable movie with a cookie-cutter plot and no real focus to the narrative.\n\nThe story is about a grieving cop who lost his wife to some nefarious bad guys. He becomes involved in a plot involving an illicit drug that, surprise surprise, turns out to have some relation to his wife's death, and the film goes from there. But despite a fairly shot running time (1 hour 40 minutes to be precise), the plot is meandering and the action sequences are anything but exciting. They're supposed to feel dynamic, over the top, and are often depicted via slow motion, but they're also bland and sanitised in order to garner a PG-13 rating. It's like a dog biting you without any teeth.\n\nWahlberg is okay as the hero, but he doesn't bring much to the part. He's no better or worse than an out-for-revenge Seagal in one of his early efforts. The supporting cast is notable for either being cast for their looks (Mila Kunis and Olga Kurylenko make good sisters, I admit) or half-recognisable past it types (Beau Bridges and Chris O'Donnell, what are you doing here?). The addition to the narrative of some dream-type sequences involving fiery demons is an unwelcome distraction to the otherwise grounded storyline and feels like an effort to add a bit of CONSTANTINE to an otherwise mundane film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124833,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-22","keywords":"corporate crime,based on video game,corporate executive,gunfight,corruption","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Max Payne: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3542614041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMTIyNDgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY4MjI5MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMTIyNDgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY4MjI5MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Max Payne, directed by John Moore."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005109/","name":"Mila Kunis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000977/","name":"Beau Bridges"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601382/","name":"John Moore"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041041/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036394/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232715/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2830774/","name":"Beau Thorne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053843/","name":"Sam Lake"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And if that's not enough to put you off watching it, I don't know what is. Game adaptations don't have the best cinematic reputation out there. In fact, I can't think of a single decent one off the top of my head; the one that springs to mind foremost in relation to this film is the 2007 film Hit-man, which turned out to be very poor indeed. Max Payne isn't quite that bad, but it is a trite and predictable movie with a cookie-cutter plot and no real focus to the narrative.\n\nThe story is about a grieving cop who lost his wife to some nefarious bad guys. He becomes involved in a plot involving an illicit drug that, surprise surprise, turns out to have some relation to his wife's death, and the film goes from there. But despite a fairly shot running time (1 hour 40 minutes to be precise), the plot is meandering and the action sequences are anything but exciting. They're supposed to feel dynamic, over the top, and are often depicted via slow motion, but they're also bland and sanitised in order to garner a PG-13 rating. It's like a dog biting you without any teeth.\n\nWahlberg is okay as the hero, but he doesn't bring much to the part. He's no better or worse than an out-for-revenge Seagal in one of his early efforts. The supporting cast is notable for either being cast for their looks (Mila Kunis and Olga Kurylenko make good sisters, I admit) or half-recognisable past it types (Beau Bridges and Chris O'Donnell, what are you doing here?). The addition to the narrative of some dream-type sequences involving fiery demons is an unwelcome distraction to the otherwise grounded storyline and feels like an effort to add a bit of CONSTANTINE to an otherwise mundane film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124833,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-22","keywords":"corporate crime,based on video game,corporate executive,gunfight,corruption","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Max Payne: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3542614041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMTIyNDgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY4MjI5MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMTIyNDgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY4MjI5MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Max Payne, directed by John Moore.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005109/","name":"Mila Kunis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000977/","name":"Beau Bridges"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601382/","name":"John Moore"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036394/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232715/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2830774/","name":"Beau Thorne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053843/","name":"Sam Lake"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As Good As Ghostbusters.","reviewBody":"As I stated above, Men In Black is just as good as the sci-fi comedies Ghostbusters I and II. But instead of chasing ghost's we're chasing after rogue aliens.\n\nJames (Will Smith) is an officer in the NYPD and one of the top officers. After a hard night, James is questioned by his own police force for allegedly killing a suspect who fell off a building. As James insists that the person was acting strangely, Agent K (Tommmy Lee Jones) comes in and takes him out. \n\nJames is welcomed to a secret agency which keeps aliens in check. After a brief examination of his life, James (now Agent J) joins the agency. On his first day, suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war. \n\nThe chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon, the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.\n\nThe presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. \n\nMen In Black. Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Linda Fiorentino, and Rip Torn.\n\n4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":543103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1997-07-02","keywords":"alien,pantyhose,superhero,flying saucer,laser gun","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1466737177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg1MDQ2MzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ0ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg1MDQ2MzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ0ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A streetwise NYPD detective joins a secret organization that polices extraterrestrial affairs on Earth."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000400/","name":"Linda Fiorentino"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001756/","name":"Barry Sonnenfeld"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192384/","name":"Lowell Cunningham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004412/","name":"Ed Solomon"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As Good As Ghostbusters.","reviewBody":"As I stated above, Men In Black is just as good as the sci-fi comedies Ghostbusters I and II. But instead of chasing ghost's we're chasing after rogue aliens.\n\nJames (Will Smith) is an officer in the NYPD and one of the top officers. After a hard night, James is questioned by his own police force for allegedly killing a suspect who fell off a building. As James insists that the person was acting strangely, Agent K (Tommmy Lee Jones) comes in and takes him out. \n\nJames is welcomed to a secret agency which keeps aliens in check. After a brief examination of his life, James (now Agent J) joins the agency. On his first day, suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war. \n\nThe chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon, the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.\n\nThe presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. \n\nMen In Black. Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Linda Fiorentino, and Rip Torn.\n\n4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":543103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1997-07-02","keywords":"alien,pantyhose,superhero,flying saucer,laser gun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1466737177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg1MDQ2MzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ0ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg1MDQ2MzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ0ODkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A streetwise NYPD detective joins a secret organization that polices extraterrestrial affairs on Earth.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000400/","name":"Linda Fiorentino"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001756/","name":"Barry Sonnenfeld"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192384/","name":"Lowell Cunningham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004412/","name":"Ed Solomon"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Well, despite being exactly that, this new adventure of the prehistoric mammals manages to stay on its own legs and delivers nothing but great fun becoming a worthy sequel. That alone is an achievement in its own right.\n\nAfter some years living in peace in a new pack, our old friends Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego the Sabertooth tiger (Dennis Leary) discover that the ice is melting and a flood will cover the valley they now call home. Soon they organize a migration, but the trip won't be easy, specially for Manny, who begins to believe that he is the last Mammoth on earth.\n\n"The Meltdown" continues with the style of its predecessor both in humor and animation, so those who fell in love with the original will love the sequel too. The difference however, is in the fact that now Manny is our main character. We get to know more about this character apparently anti-social and cynic, but who in the inside feels very lonely after the loss of his family. Sid and Diego make good sidekicks in this adventure and while their roles in the film are somewhat diminished, they still are very well-developed characters. Scrat, the nut-obsessed squirrel is back too in his constant quest for his lost nut, giving slapstick humor of the finest type in every scene he is in.\n\nIt is always hard for sequels to live up to the expectations, specially in family-oriented animation films, but director Carlos Saldanha and his team manage to make a funny movie that never gets boring or tiresome (something vital as it is a movie mainly oriented for kids).\n\nWhile probably the story is not exactly original or complicated, writers Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow make up for it with good character development and funny one-liners that fit the movie tone very good. Two new characters, the young possums Crash (Sean William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) are a welcomed addition to the family, as well as Ellie (Queen Latifah), the lost mammoth.\n\nEllie, Manny and their relationship is a very important subplot in the movie, and one that was perfectly handled by the director and his crew. While Diego's subplot was also interesting and served as basis for very good jokes, it didn't had enough screen-time; a shame in my opinion, but overall the movie was very good.\n\nTo summarize, fans of the first "Ice Age" won't be disappointed by "The Meltdown", and sure the movie will give laughs to both kids and their parents. While still not as good as the first one, this sequel breaks the "sequel's curse" and is an entertaining film on its own right. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-04-05","keywords":"ice age,sid character,scrat character,manny character,diego character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ice Age 2: The Meltdown","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi110166297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzZjIxZDItY2NkMS00OGU0LWJmNGUtZTlmY2M5ZjUzNjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzZjIxZDItY2NkMS00OGU0LWJmNGUtZTlmY2M5ZjUzNjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005380/","name":"Ray Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757858/","name":"Carlos Saldanha"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0310087/","name":"Peter Gaulke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0841532/","name":"Gerry Swallow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2186362/","name":"Jim Hecht"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When a comically inept con man (Jon Polito) comes to town, wanting to find a partner in a new business called "dry cleaning," we can see the signs a block away: Blackmail, best-laid-plans, murder ahead. The emphasis in this extremely academic take--more academic even than the Ph.Dish MILLER'S CROSSING--is on the sociological and political roots of noir. The postwarness, the cold-warness, the sunshine-boomtownness of the movie's mythical Santa Rosa (the location of SHADOW OF A DOUBT--but really, it's just early-Ellroy L.A.) are all underlined and double-underlined.\n\n So far, so cool--and the movie is far easier to enjoy as a series of Abstracted Noir Components than the similarly suspension-of-disbelief-free LOST HIGHWAY. But then Noir Guy starts contemplating hair. He is the Sisyphus of Noirtown, performing a perfectly stupid task that never ceases to repeat itself, without gathering the slightest meaning. He even, in his blank way, waxes philosophical, like a Marine-town Woyzeck: "I want...I wanna put hair with...dirt, regular house dirt." "Ed, what the heck are ya talkin' about?" "I...Skip it."\n\n And soon the movie metamorphs into a fedoras-and-Pall-Malls riff on Camus' THE STRANGER. Why does the Man Who Wasn't There kick off the chain of events that brings down all manner of ruination? Jealousy? Boredom? No ordinary human motives will do. And the Coens slyly insert a shyster lawyer (Tony Shalhoub) who's full of dime-store variants on post-structuralist touchstones: he uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as a sort of Twinkie Defense, and claims that his client is "Modern Man himself!...Indict him, and you are indicting yourself!" All of which, the Coens make clear, is so much malarkey--a way of kidding oneself, substituting entropy for dogma, avoiding the scary unknowableness of being alive.\n\n Ethan Coen described THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE as "the movie Martin Heidegger would have made if he had come to Hollywood"--unusually forthright for two guys who are just, aw shucks, entertainers. Like Spielberg's A.I., it uses a  perfectedness of technique to render the world as an arrangement of totemic  abstractions--pixilated dots that don't add up to a coherent object. The movie gets you, terrifyingly and melancholically, inside the head of a guy for whom the simplest, table-and-chairs stuff is ceasing to make sense.

When a comically inept con man (Jon Polito) comes to town, wanting to find a partner in a new business called "dry cleaning," we can see the signs a block away: Blackmail, best-laid-plans, murder ahead. The emphasis in this extremely academic take--more academic even than the Ph.Dish MILLER'S CROSSING--is on the sociological and political roots of noir. The postwarness, the cold-warness, the sunshine-boomtownness of the movie's mythical Santa Rosa (the location of SHADOW OF A DOUBT--but really, it's just early-Ellroy L.A.) are all underlined and double-underlined.\n\n So far, so cool--and the movie is far easier to enjoy as a series of Abstracted Noir Components than the similarly suspension-of-disbelief-free LOST HIGHWAY. But then Noir Guy starts contemplating hair. He is the Sisyphus of Noirtown, performing a perfectly stupid task that never ceases to repeat itself, without gathering the slightest meaning. He even, in his blank way, waxes philosophical, like a Marine-town Woyzeck: "I want...I wanna put hair with...dirt, regular house dirt." "Ed, what the heck are ya talkin' about?" "I...Skip it."\n\n And soon the movie metamorphs into a fedoras-and-Pall-Malls riff on Camus' THE STRANGER. Why does the Man Who Wasn't There kick off the chain of events that brings down all manner of ruination? Jealousy? Boredom? No ordinary human motives will do. And the Coens slyly insert a shyster lawyer (Tony Shalhoub) who's full of dime-store variants on post-structuralist touchstones: he uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as a sort of Twinkie Defense, and claims that his client is "Modern Man himself!...Indict him, and you are indicting yourself!" All of which, the Coens make clear, is so much malarkey--a way of kidding oneself, substituting entropy for dogma, avoiding the scary unknowableness of being alive.\n\n Ethan Coen described THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE as "the movie Martin Heidegger would have made if he had come to Hollywood"--unusually forthright for two guys who are just, aw shucks, entertainers. Like Spielberg's A.I., it uses a  perfectedness of technique to render the world as an arrangement of totemic  abstractions--pixilated dots that don't add up to a coherent object. The movie gets you, terrifyingly and melancholically, inside the head of a guy for whom the simplest, table-and-chairs stuff is ceasing to make sense. And the brothers use Carter Burwell's variant on Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" in a way that's as crazily persistent, and ceaselessly effective, as the insanely repetitive romantic theme from Godard's CONTEMPT. (Not even Godard has used late Beethoven so aptly.) Like BARRY LYNDON, another movie whose central question is "What kind of a man are you?," THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE has an elusive, smokelike plangency. It's a picture you'll puzzle over, and sigh achingly at its images, for many years to come.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":107599,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-10-26","keywords":"neo noir,chain smoking,santa rosa california,piano,1940s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Man Who Wasn't There","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3169845529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzZThhNTctYjRmMy00NDU3LWI4MGUtOGQyMmI5Mzg1OTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzZThhNTctYjRmMy00NDU3LWI4MGUtOGQyMmI5Mzg1OTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from USA Films","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000671/","name":"Billy Bob Thornton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000531/","name":"Frances McDormand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045937/","name":"Michael Badalucco"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018555/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068186/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They actually used a gun in this film. First time I've seen a zombie do more than eat. They even went in the water. Apes don't do that!

Maybe the undead do not like the cold. He find himself trapped between various warring factions, including a ruthless CEO (Dennis Hopper) who offers safety to the wealthy while allowing the unwashed masses to fend for themselves, a fellow mercenary (John Leguizamo) who will sacrifice anyone to advance his own agenda, and hordes of zombies who are starting to take steps up the evolutionary ladder. They actually used a gun in this film. First time I've seen a zombie do more than eat. They even went in the water. Apes don't do that! Lots of blood, but there was less action than I've seen and more talking.\n\nI love John Leguizamo, and that made it worth my time. Seeing Asia Argento (xXx) wasn't bad either.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95122,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-24","keywords":"zombie apocalypse,post apocalypse,zombie film,zombie survival,survival horror","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Land of the Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1419051289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000782/","name":"Asia Argento","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048932/","name":"Simon Baker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

It truly is designed for both men and women with fantastic views on romance, sex, attraction etc from both sides.\n\nActing is great, story is great and the chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler works very well on screen.\n\nTo sum this film up I have to say watch it. Make your own mind up. But I bet you won't be disappointed and I bet you can't stop yourself from one agreeing with some of the points made and two laughing out loud.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-09-23","keywords":"bad date,tv show,nudity,wrapped in a towel,blonde","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Ugly Truth - Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3848143641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTAyNTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTAyNTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A macho morning TV show correspondent (Butler) makes a bet with his love-challenged producer (Heigl): If his tips on how to land and keep a guy don't work, he'll quit the business.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001337/","name":"Katherine Heigl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0877430/","name":"Bree Turner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525659/","name":"Robert Luketic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2946831/","name":"Nicole Eastman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527581/","name":"Karen McCullah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809006/","name":"Kirsten Smith"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It truly is designed for both men and women with fantastic views on romance, sex, attraction etc from both sides.\n\nActing is great, story is great and the chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler works very well on screen.\n\nTo sum this film up I have to say watch it. Make your own mind up. But I bet you won't be disappointed and I bet you can't stop yourself from one agreeing with some of the points made and two laughing out loud.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-09-23","keywords":"bad date,tv show,nudity,wrapped in a towel,blonde","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Ugly Truth - Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3848143641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTAyNTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTAyNTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A macho morning TV show correspondent (Butler) makes a bet with his love-challenged producer (Heigl): If his tips on how to land and keep a guy don't work, he'll quit the business.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001337/","name":"Katherine Heigl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0877430/","name":"Bree Turner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525659/","name":"Robert Luketic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2946831/","name":"Nicole Eastman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527581/","name":"Karen McCullah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809006/","name":"Kirsten Smith"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average.

Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman, but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea, and the result is this.....\n\nA mess.\n\nI will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.\n\nLike the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release, so I ended up getting a little more than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining, to say the least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful, playful, loose genre-bending comedy with some outstanding performances, an inspired comedy script, and some great work from director David Gordon Green, certainly one of the finest young directors around.\n\nThe latter group is correct. "Pineapple Express" is, as a whole, the best movie the Apatow clan has produced yet. David Gordon Green is unquestionably the best director to direct one of these movies, but this is also a very different sort of movie than the films he usually directs. Does he rise to the challenge? He certainly does. I never would have believed that he was capable of directing such exciting and fun action scenes, or keep the movie's tone steady despite the different elements it consists of being so wildly disparate, but somehow he pulls it off. No other stoner movie can claim to be as artful and well-directed as this film.\n\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's much-anticipated follow-up to "Superbad" is an excellent screenplay, but expect none of the realism and resonance of that film; "Pineapple Express" is all about the laughs, and the laughs are certainly here, and they are practically non-stop, with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue, acting, or the sort of incredible sight gag this movie does so well. This is just great comedy throughout. \n\nIn addition to David Gordon Green's excellent work as director, the film is technically superb. The soundtrack and use of music is brilliant, and frequent Gordon Green collaborator Tim Orr's cinematography is consistently great. \n\n"Pineapple Express" will be an inherently divisive film. It didn't get the sort of critical accolades many previous Apatow clan movies did, and I expect audiences will also be a little less unanimous. Indeed, there's little of the critic-pleasing dramatic scenes Apatow's comedies have been praised for, and even when they do pop up they're usually deflated instantly with a joke, and credit has to go to director David Gordon Green for his expert handling of the film's tone, which never becomes schmaltzy, thank the heavens. Really, the whole film is throughly enjoyable except for the very last scene in the film, which contains one of the film's best jokes, but is really hard to buy given the state the characters are in, and also more than a little forced. Aside from that moment the whole thing works beautifully, quite astounding given the mesh of many different genres and sorts of comedy that this is. You either go with this movies sense of humor or you don't, and I imagine more people will enjoy the first three quarters of the movie, before the big, long action scene happens, and lots and lots of violence occurs. I guess you have to have a somewhat morbid sense of humor to laugh at ALL of the jokes in the film, but so what? There are also some nice little tongue-in-cheek references to the film's influences ("they messed with the wrong melon farmers"). \n\nThe cast really give it their all. It was great to see James Franco back in a comedic role, and his performance steals the show. Rogen is good as usual, Gary Cole is a perfect villain, and it's nice to see the gorgeous and talented Amber Heard finally make a quality film (and get one of the film's funniest scenes as her character's final scene). The supporting cast are also all good in their roles.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why "Pineapple Express" won't work for many people, and they will probably end up being the very reasons the film works for those who like it. The film's plot is inherently silly to an extent (although this is nowhere near the "Anchorman" style of comedy), and one must be prepared for an outright comedy and not something in the vein of "Knocked Up". "Pineapple Express" may end up being more enjoyable for stoners and those with friends who are stoners, but it works on its own as great comedy because the humor has much more range and scope than just marijuana. One of the best comedies in years.\n\n9/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328977,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up,handcuffed man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While I too have fond memories of seeing the original animated version at the theatre, I was at least willing to give this one a chance. I'm glad I did. Firstly, people need to realise an animated film and live-action film are two different things. Some things that work in animation just won't translate too well into live-action. The other thing to accept is that, short of resurrecting Robin Williams, there was no way they were ever going to be able to replicate his unique take on the character of the Genie. Once you open your mind to the possibility that something can be 'different' but also *good*; then you'll have a more pleasant experience. That's what we get here: a movie that is familiar, but at the same time new/different (and that's not a bad thing).\n\nFrom the very beginning, the movie is somewhat different to what we might be expecting when we're introduced to who is telling the story. While it was immediately evident to me what was going on, it wasn't a 'bad' addition. After sweeping shots set to the song 'Arabian Nights', we're introduced to the 'street rat' named Aladdin. Although much fuss has been made about the Genie casting, if Aladdin had been miscast, then the whole film would've suffered. Thankfully, I can say that I almost immediately liked Mena Massoud in the role. He's funny, got moves/charm, makes for a likeable 'thief' and his relationship with his pet monkey, Abu, is as good as I'd hoped it'd be. Speaking of, although people think of CGI characters badly a lot of the time, it must be made clear the animal companions in this are all wonderfully brought to life/fully-realised characters. Abu is expressive, funny, and helpful (despite sometimes getting them both into trouble).\n\nNot before long Aladdin encounters Princess Jasmine (a well-cast Naomi Scott, who does a lot with the character and should make most Jasmine fans proud), who's undercover among the people. I was afraid that the movie would rush through their first meeting, but was happy with the amount of time devoted to them developing an interest in each other. I could instantly tell that the beloved character of Jasmine was in safe hands as portrayed by Naomi Scott and that she had nice chemistry with Massoud's Aladdin. Although not given as much to do as Abu, Jasmine's loyal tiger companion, Rajah, is another lovely animal created with CGI, who I appreciated wasn't largely ignored. Jasmine's other loyal friend, her handmaiden named Dalia, is actually a stand-out character in the movie. Nasim Pedrad has excellent comic timing, as does Naomi Scott, which is on full display in a fun scene where Aladdin comes to the palace and Jasmine attempts to maintain her cover.\n\nThe one 'miss' in the casting department is that of Marwan Kenzari as villainous Jafar. While others had pre-judged him based on the trailers alone, I was willing to give him a chance to make up for his lack of sinister voice with what would hopefully be at least a menacing performance. Sadly, he lacks even that. There's nothing particularly memorable about his portrayal (even near the end when he's given every opportunity to unleash in full-on villain mode, he falls way short). About the only 'positive' I could find regarding his character is his animal companion of Iago. The red parrot might not be quite as talkative as the animated version, but he *does* talk (and in a much more bird-like way), getting a few funny lines here and there (I'd expect nothing less from Alan Tudyk providing the voice). It's just disappointing that Jafar's miscast, and thus the 'weak link' in the film.\n\nWhat most people are probably wondering about is Will Smith as the Genie. I actually thought he was pretty good here (and I found him more likeable in this role than I have in any movie I've seen him in since probably the first Men In Black). There are just one or two instances where I felt he tried to emulate Robin Williams' version and it didn't quite work, but on the whole I felt he brought his own energy/style to the character of Genie and it (mostly) worked. The most important thing was the friendship that he formed with Aladdin. While Smith's Genie may seem a bit more snarky than you might expect, when it comes to the emotional beats, his performance hits the right notes (especially near the end).\n\nSpeaking of notes, "What about the songs?" you may ask. I was pretty happy with them, there were just the right amount and they didn't feel particularly intrusive in any of the scenes they were featured. Even the new song, 'Speechless', isn't too bad (though there are those who'll no doubt complain). Massoud and Scott have really nice singing voices and did their songs justice, I thought. Will Smith's also decent with his main songs in the movie (the end credits one I could've done without, though).\n\nI must also praise the costumes (Jasmine's are all stunning, as is Jasmine herself), the use of vibrant colours is quite impressive and the overall look of the film feels like something new/different to what we've seen time and time again in films (especially Disney ones). Things I forgot to mention: the Magic Carpet has as much 'character' as in the original (I especially appreciated seeing how close friends Carpet and Abu became by the end), and even the Sultan's head guard, Hakim, is given some depth.\n\nIn conclusion, if you go into the theatre already disliking/hating the film based on just the trailers, then you're probably going to leave the same way you entered: bitter and thinking things like "It ruined my childhood!" (such a rubbish statement). Just try accepting this is a different thing and hopefully you'll enjoy it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-05-22","keywords":"hero,monkey,genie character,tiger,parrot","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Aladdin","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3875453977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4565815/","name":"Mena Massoud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4305463/","name":"Naomi Scott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226345/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0699871/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-06","keywords":"car,car movie,route 66,truck,tow truck","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460146/","name":"Jorgen Klubien"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In truth, the Spartans were backed by a mixed force of almost 7,000, while there are enormous variations in modern estimates of the multi-ethnic Persian army, but somewhere between 100,000-200,000 seems realistic. Whatever the actual figures, the odds against the Spartans were terrible, death was inevitable, and their honour secure.\n\nThe story was first told on film in 1962 when director Rudolph Maté went to Greece and shot a worthy, but conventional and surprisingly leaden, version entitled "The 300 Spartans", starring American Richard Egan as King Leonidas and the British David Farrar as Xerxes. "300" takes the same basic narrative and presents it in an utterly different style in a blood-fest when "The Wild Bunch" meets "Kill Bill" and the visuals are like nothing except "Sin City". This time the director is Zack Snyder, known for his music videos, and the location is a studio set in Montreal with green backgrounds later filled by superb computer-generated graphics and the whole storybook style is based on the graphic novel by co-producer Frank Miller. Both versions use the legendary exchange: "When we attack today, our arrows will blot out the sun!" "Good; then we will fight in the shade." But only "300" has such fun lines as: "Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!" \n\nEver since its first public showing at the Berlin Film Festival, most critics have mauled "300" and it presents an easy target for those wanting something more cerebral: there is virtually no plot or characterisation, the script is sparse and bland, much of the acting is exaggerated and over-loud, when it is not homo-erotic it is oddly camp, and the whole thing is stereotypical when it is not outright xenophobic and politically incorrect. And yet, as entertainment, it has much to offer: the sepia-tinged visuals are absolutely stunning and the fight sequences viscerally exciting.

Most of the warriors are literally larger than life: the actors playing the Spartans reveal most of their bodies with digitally-enhanced muscles, while on Xerxes' side characters include a huge hunchback, a giant emissary and a claw-armed executioner as well the metal-masked Immortals. This is before we get on to an enormous raging rhino and bedecked elephants. Truly this is a battle with a circus-like cast. The love interest comes from the feisty wife of Leonidas, Queen Gorgo, portrayed by the alluring British actress Lena Headey. There is even a scene in a rippling corn field borrowed from "Gladiator".\n\nAt the end of the day, what makes the movie are the thrilling fight sequences with encounters in which the film is slowed down and then speeded up to give a video-game quality that is unlike anything you have previously seen on the big screen.

What happens when we move from Roger Ailes to Leni Riefenstahl? Well, here we have something that tells me we are close.\n\nThe values behind this thing are disturbing, even repellent. The history is even backwards, needlessly so. But this is so finely crafted, so extraordinarily fine tuned story-telling that I have to remark on it. So set aside the dangerous notions of self and sex as explosive violence. Set aside jingowoven, hooha misogyny. Set aside the notion that every blow is spectacularly fatal. \n\nThe original was notable in its production method; a few real objects and bodies in the foreground with synthesized, situational background. A side effect of this method allowed two teams to optimize independently. So the main characters had refined, economical costumes and totems.\n\nThe similar, more traditional process used for example in "Gravity" tightly connected the synthesized bits with the foreground actors, with the side effect of constraining both. Narrative economy had to be found elsewhere, and was.\n\nBut here, you basically have two movies, one playing behind the other.

What happens when we move from Roger Ailes to Leni Riefenstahl? Well, here we have something that tells me we are close.\n\nThe values behind this thing are disturbing, even repellent. The history is even backwards, needlessly so. But this is so finely crafted, so extraordinarily fine tuned story-telling that I have to remark on it. So set aside the dangerous notions of self and sex as explosive violence. Set aside jingowoven, hooha misogyny. Set aside the notion that every blow is spectacularly fatal. \n\nThe original was notable in its production method; a few real objects and bodies in the foreground with synthesized, situational background. A side effect of this method allowed two teams to optimize independently. So the main characters had refined, economical costumes and totems.\n\nThe similar, more traditional process used for example in "Gravity" tightly connected the synthesized bits with the foreground actors, with the side effect of constraining both. Narrative economy had to be found elsewhere, and was.\n\nBut here, you basically have two movies, one playing behind the other. Each has its own cinematic philosophy and creative team.\n\nAn example of how conscious of this and clever these folks are; how do you integrate these? I mean visually, because this is essentially a new cinematic vocabulary. Well, you introduce spatial dust that exists in both worlds simultaneously. Every scene here has this dust, sometimes floating embers. It jars at first, but the distraction is necessary to its effectiveness. \n\nAnother example: nearly every filmed battle we have in our cinematic tradition is a land battle.

I know some people take the approach of "I see real life everyday, I go to the cinema to escape it" but this film is very much a celebration of family life and love and those things are just as important as big budget blockbusters with CGI galore.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It would be the toughest of sells to a culture that would likely feel the material is too dry and the demand too little. A slightly campier script, with luxurious set design and intimate portrayals of characters the public wouldn't likely know about is what I'd like to get my hands on. The story of Liberace is stranger than fiction and dryer, more serious material could've corrupted its overall goals and ambitions.\n\nThe film with the campier script, luxurious set designs, and intimate portrayals is Steven Soderbergh's Behind the Candelabra, a wonderful, limitless look at the life of Liberace, an enigma in every sense of the word. In addition to playing many sold-out shows, the man had a lovelife like no other at the time, meeting and becoming fast friends with Scott Thorson, an aspiring veterinarian who was quickly made his lover. Thorson seemed to have a genuine understanding of the loneliness and lack of friendship Liberace had and provided him with great talks, great compassion, and great sex.\n\nThe relationship, however, resulted in drug addiction, intense plastic surgery, lies, mistrust, and ended with a lawsuit. Soderbergh and writer Richard LaGravenese don't hesitate to explore this and make it one of the deepest focuses in the picture. The relationships the men had had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The scenes when they are together in a hot tub are human and romantic. The scenes when they are fighting are heartbreaking because you realize that these men haven't just come so far to make their relationship work but losing each other after so long would be detrimental to their self-esteems and egos. They complete each other and that's where the magic is at its strongest.\n\nLiberace is played by Michael Douglas in one of the bravest roles of his career. So brave and powerful that it's unfortunate that because of the film's TV movie status it is ineligible for an Academy Award nomination. Douglas is an actor who is never conventional with his role choice. The same man who played a common-man pushed off a cliff of sanity, an executive victim to a consuming, real-life game, and a worried father of a drug-addicted daughter is the same man playing a middle-aged, flamboyant pianist with a love for wonder, music, and men. The diversity in role choice is stunning.\n\nMatt Damon appears at his youngest as Liberace's lover Scott, in an equally conflicted, complex performance. Damon fills the shoes of the role beautifully and effectively, giving off much in the way of creative energy and heart as he shows just how stressed and torn Thorson must've been in a relationship with someone who truly loved and understood him but wanted to manipulate him. Supporting performances from Rob Lowe as Liberace's doctor, prescribing medicines to both him and Thorson and Dan Aykroyd as his manager are terrific and often are seen providing strong comic relief.\n\nFor a TV movie to have the cinematography and atmosphere that Behind the Candelabra does is truly a feature worth nothing. It may not be as excessive as Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby - I don't expect anything of the next two years to be on par with that film - but rarely has a TV movie achieved such phenomenally vibrant and luscious standards. The only thing that could make it better is Soderbergh proving he knows how to work with it and he most certainly does.\n\nHBO seems to be the go-to network for biographical films about figures that wouldn't likely make appropriate return in the theaters (Behind the Candelabra especially considering the summer movie season has already hit the ground running). David Mamet, just a few months ago, directed the delightful and shockingly unbiased Phil Spector, with actors like Al Pacino and Helen Mirren receiving top-billing. Seeing as a Liberace biopic is directed by none other than Soderbergh, I wouldn't be surprised at seeing a slew of films about eclectic media figures being made and released on HBO in the next few years. Networks that have the drive and willingness to air these kinds of films are a necessity to the success of film.\n\nStarring: Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Rob Lowe, and Dan Aykroyd.

The rest is history.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2015,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-08","keywords":"paris peace conference,world war one,treaty of versailles,kingdom of romania,romanian abroad","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi904511513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5404849/","name":"Roxana Lupu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088951/","name":"Daniel Plier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253355/","name":"Richard Elfyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087275/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0030727/","name":"Gabi Antal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.\n\nBrave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.\n\nPixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo.

Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress.

Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.\n\nBrave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":392722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"princess,mother daughter relationship,archery,female warrior,rebellious daughter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Families Legend","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678863641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom.

It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.\n\nBrave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.\n\nPixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket.

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":430315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The new rendition takes the expectation and rises beyond with emotionally engaging and larger-than-life characters, which is no small feat considering it relies on sole child actor Neel Sethi while the rest of the veteran cast lend their voices for the animal kingdom.\n\nStory follows Mowgli (Neel Sethi) on his two feet as he ventures around the thick jungle. He meets with near mythical allies and foes alike, while learning and accepting his unique nature. A lot rest on his small shoulders, and as Mowgli he performs remarkably well.

The new rendition takes the expectation and rises beyond with emotionally engaging and larger-than-life characters, which is no small feat considering it relies on sole child actor Neel Sethi while the rest of the veteran cast lend their voices for the animal kingdom.\n\nStory follows Mowgli (Neel Sethi) on his two feet as he ventures around the thick jungle. He meets with near mythical allies and foes alike, while learning and accepting his unique nature. A lot rest on his small shoulders, and as Mowgli he performs remarkably well. He presents an innocent vibe even though the harsh jungle is demanding and sometimes merciless.\n\nVisual is utterly impressive, these beasts look and move very naturally.

I like the references to those shows but these are the new generation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-10-25","keywords":"lesbian,vampire,witch,high school,spin off","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5994559/","name":"Danielle Rose Russell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7263948/","name":"Aria Shahghasemi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7875835/","name":"Quincy Fouse"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0429120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142434/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687096/","name":"Julie Plec"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3129328409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRjMjZjNmYtN2MwOS00ZDY5LWExMzEtYTM4YTc5MmUxMjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRjMjZjNmYtN2MwOS00ZDY5LWExMzEtYTM4YTc5MmUxMjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The plot may be confusing at first, but when the second half of the film starts there are no lingering questions and a pantload of great action bits and one-liners. Frankly, the last 45 minutes are absolutely outstanding. The first half takes a bit to really pick up, but it's the second half of the movie that will leave old fans and new yearning for a sequel.\n\nThere are some sad moments, some gut busting lines, and some rousing actions sequences that make "Serenity" a wonderful film that really, really deserves a sequel and, perhaps if we're lucky, a second chance on Sci-Fi.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":291054,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2006-05-31","keywords":"reavers,captain,26th century,megacorporation,on the run","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Serenity Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3489464857","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQyNDUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3NTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQyNDUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3NTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"For test purposes only."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868659/","name":"Gina Torres"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923736/","name":"Joss Whedon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018092/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923736/","name":"Joss Whedon"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The plot may be confusing at first, but when the second half of the film starts there are no lingering questions and a pantload of great action bits and one-liners. Frankly, the last 45 minutes are absolutely outstanding. The first half takes a bit to really pick up, but it's the second half of the movie that will leave old fans and new yearning for a sequel.\n\nThere are some sad moments, some gut busting lines, and some rousing actions sequences that make "Serenity" a wonderful film that really, really deserves a sequel and, perhaps if we're lucky, a second chance on Sci-Fi.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":291054,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2006-05-31","keywords":"reavers,captain,26th century,megacorporation,on the run","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Serenity Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3489464857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQyNDUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3NTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQyNDUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3NTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"For test purposes only.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868659/","name":"Gina Torres","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923736/","name":"Joss Whedon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018092/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923736/","name":"Joss Whedon"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue. Whatever the future holds for the show the excellent Colin Morgan has a bright career ahead of him.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":78296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-09-20","keywords":"magic,mentor protege relationship,witch,half brother half sister relationship,merlin the magician","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000457/","name":"John Hurt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2959880/","name":"Colin Morgan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3010926/","name":"Bradley James"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104889/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103752/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0999606/","name":"Johnny Capps"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428483/","name":"Julian Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2350239/","name":"Jake Michie"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Merlin: The Complete First Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi991207705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWE1MDczOTUtMjY2Mi00ZDNmLWFjNTAtNDljZTEyZDUxMWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWE1MDczOTUtMjY2Mi00ZDNmLWFjNTAtNDljZTEyZDUxMWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Merlin: The Complete First Season"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue. Whatever the future holds for the show the excellent Colin Morgan has a bright career ahead of him.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":78296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-09-20","keywords":"magic,mentor protege relationship,witch,half brother half sister relationship,merlin the magician","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000457/","name":"John Hurt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2959880/","name":"Colin Morgan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3010926/","name":"Bradley James"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104889/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103752/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0999606/","name":"Johnny Capps","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428483/","name":"Julian Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2350239/","name":"Jake Michie"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Merlin: The Complete First Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi991207705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWE1MDczOTUtMjY2Mi00ZDNmLWFjNTAtNDljZTEyZDUxMWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWE1MDczOTUtMjY2Mi00ZDNmLWFjNTAtNDljZTEyZDUxMWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Merlin: The Complete First Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.\n\nSanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.\n\nFor Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site.

In the present days, the outcast linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is invited by a mysterious woman to decipher an ancient hieroglyph in a military facility. Soon he finds that the device was developed by an advanced civilization and opens a portal to teletransport to another planet. Dr. Jackson is invited to join a military team under the command of Colonel Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) that will explore the new world. They find a land that recalls Egypt and humans in a primitive culture that worship and are slaves to Ra, the God of the Sun. But soon they discover the secret of the mysterious "stargate". \n\n"Stargate" is still a fantastic sci-fi after almost twenty years and watching it at least six times. The story is intriguing and entwines action with humor and romance. The cast is excellent, with Kurt Russell and James Spade in the top of their careers. The special effects are still great after almost twenty years. And the haunting music score completes this timeless classic sci-fi with a touch of class.

In the present days, the outcast linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is invited by a mysterious woman to decipher an ancient hieroglyph in a military facility. Soon he finds that the device was developed by an advanced civilization and opens a portal to teletransport to another planet. Dr. Jackson is invited to join a military team under the command of Colonel Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) that will explore the new world. They find a land that recalls Egypt and humans in a primitive culture that worship and are slaves to Ra, the God of the Sun. But soon they discover the secret of the mysterious "stargate". \n\n"Stargate" is still a fantastic sci-fi after almost twenty years and watching it at least six times. The story is intriguing and entwines action with humor and romance. The cast is excellent, with Kurt Russell and James Spade in the top of their careers. The special effects are still great after almost twenty years. And the haunting music score completes this timeless classic sci-fi with a touch of class.

She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.\n\nSanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.\n\nFor Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site. For Americans it's on Hulu and Sci Fi's Rewind.\n\nHave fun getting into it, looking forward to see where it goes."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-03","keywords":"2000s,2010s,paranormal phenomenon,psychotronic series,timeframe 2010s","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0850102/","name":"Amanda Tapping"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0242903/","name":"Robin Dunne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0382216/","name":"Christopher Heyerdahl"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232147/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247191/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209352/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454307/","name":"Damian Kindler"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sanctuary: The Complete Fourth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi510959897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgyMWRkZDctZDdkNi00OWQ1LTg3NTMtNTY1NDk5MTAwMTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgyMWRkZDctZDdkNi00OWQ1LTg3NTMtNTY1NDk5MTAwMTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Sanctuary: Season Four"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.\n\nSanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.\n\nFor Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site. For Americans it's on Hulu and Sci Fi's Rewind.\n\nHave fun getting into it, looking forward to see where it goes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-03","keywords":"2000s,2010s,paranormal phenomenon,psychotronic series,timeframe 2010s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0850102/","name":"Amanda Tapping","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0242903/","name":"Robin Dunne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0382216/","name":"Christopher Heyerdahl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232147/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247191/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209352/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454307/","name":"Damian Kindler"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sanctuary: The Complete Fourth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi510959897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgyMWRkZDctZDdkNi00OWQ1LTg3NTMtNTY1NDk5MTAwMTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgyMWRkZDctZDdkNi00OWQ1LTg3NTMtNTY1NDk5MTAwMTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Sanctuary: Season Four"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But the 2005 british adaptation is lasting and not to mention the classic 1943 first movie. Watch those instead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":437,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2020-02-20","keywords":"boy dog relationship,border collie,north sea,lassie character,journey","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1825423129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNjOWQyN2ItNDFhZC00YTQ4LWJmZTItMTExMDVmZTkzZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNjOWQyN2ItNDFhZC00YTQ4LWJmZTItMTExMDVmZTkzZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8354935/","name":"Nico Marischka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0080134/","name":"Sebastian Bezzel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1031534/","name":"Anna Maria Mühe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1315409/","name":"Hanno Olderdissen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314266/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0502466/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0645969/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2203642/","name":"Jane Ainscough","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460893/","name":"Eric Knight"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Marie Elizabeth Winstead shines!","reviewBody":""All About Nina" (2018 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Nina, a struggling stand-up comedian looking to break through. As the movie opens, Nina is doing a very R-rated gig in New York, and afterwards we see her with her abusive (and married) boyfriend. Nina decides that she needs a complete change of scenery, and moves to LA. After her first stand-up show there, she gets to know Rafe, a guy who seems to be too good to be true.... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature film writing and directing debut of Eva Vives (from Spain). Here, she takes some of her own life experiences and turns them into what initially appears to be a very raunchy comedy. However, the movie changes gear several times. As Nina (who claims she doesn't date) and Rafe get to know each other better, Nina finds herself in a confused spot."You keep being honest, what is wrong with you?", Nina exasperates early on. Later, Nina confesses to a friend that "He's just the right amount of screwed-up". Yet deeper into the movie, we find out more about Nina... All of this might be a bit too much or even suspicious, if it weren't for the dazzling performance of Marie Elizabeth Winstead as Nina. She leaves it all out there (literally) for this role. Common plays the mysterious Rafe a little too aloof in my book. The stand-up scenes (of which there are quite a few) feature both Nina and a number of other wannabe's and are quite good actually. Bottom line: this lil' movie turns out to be quite the character study (as deeply flas as that character may be), with along the way quite a few raunchy stand-up comedy.\n\n"All About Nina" premiered at this year's Tribeca Film Festival, and it finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend (for a limited 1 week run, according to the theater). The Sunday early evening screening was attended so-so (about 10 people). That's a shame, but maybe the movie will do better when it opens on other platforms.

Marie Elizabeth Winstead shines!","reviewBody":""All About Nina" (2018 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Nina, a struggling stand-up comedian looking to break through. As the movie opens, Nina is doing a very R-rated gig in New York, and afterwards we see her with her abusive (and married) boyfriend. Nina decides that she needs a complete change of scenery, and moves to LA. After her first stand-up show there, she gets to know Rafe, a guy who seems to be too good to be true.... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature film writing and directing debut of Eva Vives (from Spain). Here, she takes some of her own life experiences and turns them into what initially appears to be a very raunchy comedy. However, the movie changes gear several times. As Nina (who claims she doesn't date) and Rafe get to know each other better, Nina finds herself in a confused spot."You keep being honest, what is wrong with you?", Nina exasperates early on. Later, Nina confesses to a friend that "He's just the right amount of screwed-up". Yet deeper into the movie, we find out more about Nina... All of this might be a bit too much or even suspicious, if it weren't for the dazzling performance of Marie Elizabeth Winstead as Nina. She leaves it all out there (literally) for this role. Common plays the mysterious Rafe a little too aloof in my book. The stand-up scenes (of which there are quite a few) feature both Nina and a number of other wannabe's and are quite good actually. Bottom line: this lil' movie turns out to be quite the character study (as deeply flas as that character may be), with along the way quite a few raunchy stand-up comedy.\n\n"All About Nina" premiered at this year's Tribeca Film Festival, and it finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend (for a limited 1 week run, according to the theater). The Sunday early evening screening was attended so-so (about 10 people). That's a shame, but maybe the movie will do better when it opens on other platforms. If you are interested in a character study that is at times dark and at times raunchy funny, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it at the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2656,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-28","keywords":"affair,female nudity,topless female nudity,smoking after sex,indie movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"All About Nina","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158134553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJjYzJkMTUtY2FlZS00NGQ3LTg5MmYtNTgwOTVmODY1NTEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJjYzJkMTUtY2FlZS00NGQ3LTg5MmYtNTgwOTVmODY1NTEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sublimating her own desire to self-destruct, Nina has to answer the question, once and for all, of whether women can indeed have it all.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5820134/","name":"Brodie Reed","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627893/","name":"Charlotte Newhouse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900284/","name":"Eva Vives"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0497026/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900284/","name":"Eva Vives"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.\n\nThe movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nThose are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still, if you're looking for some lighter entertainment, it's a good choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118125,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"hitman,adultery,marriage problems,nudity,bare breasts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4278959641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001612/","name":"Matthew Perry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000275/","name":"Rosanna Arquette"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026797/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438449/","name":"Mitchell Kapner"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.\n\nThe movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nThose are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still, if you're looking for some lighter entertainment, it's a good choice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118125,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"hitman,adultery,marriage problems,nudity,bare breasts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4278959641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001612/","name":"Matthew Perry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000275/","name":"Rosanna Arquette"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026797/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438449/","name":"Mitchell Kapner"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nThose are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense.

It goes without saying that this makes "Sesir" a superior product to nearly all of those awful costume dramas, all that hollow chick-flick nonsense that's been coming out of Hollywood in recent decades, infested with nepotist zeros such as Emma Thompson or Keira Knightley. Serbia is neither known for having proper movie budgets nor for stylish productions, so the fact that Americans could produce so few movies that are anywhere nearly as good as this one speaks volumes about the rapid downfall of Tinseltown, at least in terms of quality. (Box-office-wise, Americans will always lead the way because they have the creation of mega-selling garbage down to a science by now.)\n\nObviously, "Sesir" isn't for movie-goers who consider Tarantino's films the height of artistic expression, or for those who consider his dialog to be semantic art. Nor is it for kids (and child-like young adults) who spend 5 hours a day on PlayStation. People who start fidgeting in their seats whenever 5 minutes pass without someone having their throat cut can also calmly and without hesitation delete this movie from their watch-lists. I don't want to sound like a snob, because I'm anything but, yet I have to warn all those who say "ej brate brate" in every sentence (the Serb equivalent to "yo bro" and "like, stuff") that they will be terribly bored with this film. Brain-damaged football fans and blood-thirsty city hillbillies (an exponentially growing demographic in Belgrade) will struggle to get anything useful or entertaining out of these characters and from the things they say. There are no scenes here whatsoever of characters smashing each other's brains in front of river discos while shouting obscenities and waving with their guns into the air ("j***m te u tri lepe p***e materina" and the like).\n\nI am not referring to the various quotes from Schiller, Goethe etc, of which there are many here. I am referring to the nostalgic, not overly sentimental, and somewhat (suitably) romanticized depiction of a bygone era, one that existed long before Paris Hilton pleasured her first celebrity penis. How times have changed – THAT message could be seen as the most relevant by-product of this movie, amongst all the other themes and points. "Sesir" is about intellectuals, the leading minds from Serbia's late 19th/early 20th century period. The professors are just as interesting though, if not more so; all of them. Fortunately, the decision was made to tell these stories as humorous anecdotes, not as a soppy costume chick-flick drama, as Americans would have done it. I could just see the likes of Sean Penn and Tom Cruise being miscast to play the professors, while the younger crop of even dumber, even less talented Tinseltown nitwits fill the roles of the students. Can American film-makers be trusted with ANY good story anymore? \n\nSome Serbian high school kids will watch this with bewilderment, because they will be shocked that there actually existed an age in which (some) professors and their students had a very friendly or at least cordial relationship, unlike these days when it's hard to measure whether the teachers hate the students more than that students hate the teachers. Of course this is a somewhat romanticized depiction; after all this is a movie not a documentary, but it is based on some documented facts. Those kids with the tiniest vocabularies (from the utterly useless "brate brate" generation) might nervously snicker at this film, trying to poke fun at its expense in their typical inferiority-complex, insecure way. Later on, these kids will wave their Serbian flags at weddings and football matches, shouting "Serbia!", because in this country quasi-patriotism is extremely popular and "proof" of one's moral high ground.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't want to give the impression that "Sesir" is something only for the older viewers. Young viewers, at least those that aren't complete morons, will find a lot to identify with despite some obvious differences between the old and the new mentalities, because Kosta's students – although very committed to self-advancement and education – also display a large dose of playfulness and teenage exuberance.

 --- Description: Sesir profesora Koste Vujica: Directed by Zdravko Sotra. With Aleksandar Bercek, Milos Bikovic, Aleksandar Radojicic, Ljubomir Bulajic. The story of professor Kosta Vujic who in the mid-19th century taught an extraordinarily talented generation of gymnasium students, some of whom would go on to become prominent members of the Serbian society and eventually historically significant figures.

It goes without saying that this makes "Sesir" a superior product to nearly all of those awful costume dramas, all that hollow chick-flick nonsense that's been coming out of Hollywood in recent decades, infested with nepotist zeros such as Emma Thompson or Keira Knightley. Serbia is neither known for having proper movie budgets nor for stylish productions, so the fact that Americans could produce so few movies that are anywhere nearly as good as this one speaks volumes about the rapid downfall of Tinseltown, at least in terms of quality. (Box-office-wise, Americans will always lead the way because they have the creation of mega-selling garbage down to a science by now.)\n\nObviously, "Sesir" isn't for movie-goers who consider Tarantino's films the height of artistic expression, or for those who consider his dialog to be semantic art. Nor is it for kids (and child-like young adults) who spend 5 hours a day on PlayStation. People who start fidgeting in their seats whenever 5 minutes pass without someone having their throat cut can also calmly and without hesitation delete this movie from their watch-lists. I don't want to sound like a snob, because I'm anything but, yet I have to warn all those who say "ej brate brate" in every sentence (the Serb equivalent to "yo bro" and "like, stuff") that they will be terribly bored with this film. Brain-damaged football fans and blood-thirsty city hillbillies (an exponentially growing demographic in Belgrade) will struggle to get anything useful or entertaining out of these characters and from the things they say. There are no scenes here whatsoever of characters smashing each other's brains in front of river discos while shouting obscenities and waving with their guns into the air ("j***m te u tri lepe p***e materina" and the like).\n\nI am not referring to the various quotes from Schiller, Goethe etc, of which there are many here. I am referring to the nostalgic, not overly sentimental, and somewhat (suitably) romanticized depiction of a bygone era, one that existed long before Paris Hilton pleasured her first celebrity penis. How times have changed – THAT message could be seen as the most relevant by-product of this movie, amongst all the other themes and points. "Sesir" is about intellectuals, the leading minds from Serbia's late 19th/early 20th century period. The professors are just as interesting though, if not more so; all of them. Fortunately, the decision was made to tell these stories as humorous anecdotes, not as a soppy costume chick-flick drama, as Americans would have done it. I could just see the likes of Sean Penn and Tom Cruise being miscast to play the professors, while the younger crop of even dumber, even less talented Tinseltown nitwits fill the roles of the students. Can American film-makers be trusted with ANY good story anymore? \n\nSome Serbian high school kids will watch this with bewilderment, because they will be shocked that there actually existed an age in which (some) professors and their students had a very friendly or at least cordial relationship, unlike these days when it's hard to measure whether the teachers hate the students more than that students hate the teachers. Of course this is a somewhat romanticized depiction; after all this is a movie not a documentary, but it is based on some documented facts. Those kids with the tiniest vocabularies (from the utterly useless "brate brate" generation) might nervously snicker at this film, trying to poke fun at its expense in their typical inferiority-complex, insecure way. Later on, these kids will wave their Serbian flags at weddings and football matches, shouting "Serbia!", because in this country quasi-patriotism is extremely popular and "proof" of one's moral high ground.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't want to give the impression that "Sesir" is something only for the older viewers. Young viewers, at least those that aren't complete morons, will find a lot to identify with despite some obvious differences between the old and the new mentalities, because Kosta's students – although very committed to self-advancement and education – also display a large dose of playfulness and teenage exuberance. Besides, the voters' demographics on IMDb reveal that "Sesir" is much more liked among younger than older viewers – although part of the explanation for this unusual fact is that young viewers tend to give much higher marks than older viewers, i.e. younger movie-goers are less critical i.e. many lack criteria.\n\n"Sesir" isn't perfect, but it doesn't have any notable flaws. Perhaps the only criticism is that the female part of the cast is inferior, as usual (in Serbian movies/TV), but that's hardly relevant since it is the male characters that dominate this story. I do recommend the TV series more though, which I believe includes all of the scenes from the movie, because it is far more detailed hence more entertaining.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1598,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-02-01","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0073353/","name":"Aleksandar Bercek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2161450/","name":"Milos Bikovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1110617/","name":"Aleksandar Radojicic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815638/","name":"Zdravko Sotra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232523/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815638/","name":"Zdravko Sotra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900008/","name":"Milovan Vitezovic"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Motel Nana is a moving account of life in former Yugoslavia, in a place largely deserted by people who fled either the war or the economical problems, and cannot make up their minds to ever come back.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-06-06","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584020/","name":"Dragan Micanovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0420574/","name":"Nikolina Friganovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0812505/","name":"Zijah Sokolovic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0892544/","name":"Predrag Velinovic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233514/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242211/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102492/","name":"Ranko Bozic"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The reason is that this is actually a TV show cut to make a film. This film also exists in an episodic format, with more minutes I believe.\n\nThe TV-quality is the biggest flaw with the film. The cinematography is not great. No attention is given to color grading. Lighting is also weak. Scenes in a prison cell at night have too much light. Camera movement is not good. The camera captures what's in front of it, but doesn't do what cinema cameras do - move, pan, tilt, etc. \n\nI'm not nitpicking. We have to mention these things because we want the cinema of Serbia to improve. These advanced ideas do exist in some Serbian films but not so much in Serbian TV, which is stuck in the 90's. So when someone makes a Serbian film out of a TV production, it looks old. Not 1914 old, but 1994 old.\n\nThe acting is good, but I'm surprised by the casting a little. Could they not find a German-speaking actor to play Rudy? Or someone not fluent in Serbo-Croatian to play the Czech Malek? Why is so little attention given to accents?\n\nI don't care if someone has a 2000's Belgrade accent when he's supposed to be a Bosnian peasant from 1914, but did Rudy really speak so fluently and eloquently in Serbo-Croatian? What about Malek? Couldn't they have brought a Slovene or someone with an imperfect accent?\n\nThose are my complaints.\n\nThe rest of the film is very, very good. The acting is convincing. There is no overacting or wooden acting. The music was good, but I felt that they could've given more time to music, either bands, radio or score. Music is a tool and it wasn't used much in this film. \n\nEverything looked convincing, like it was 1914. \n\nIt was well-researched and there were no short-cuts taken. \n\nIt did not fall to modern political bickering. I'm not going to call it a pro-Yugo film, but it felt like one (and that's a good thing in my book.) Many Slavs lived under Austro-Hungarian occupation and annexation and there were both Pro-Yugoslav and Pan-Slavic movements. It just happens that these boys decided to act on it.\n\nThere aren't enough shots of the country. A lot of stuff happens indoors. It's not hard to do establishing shots or mood setting exterior shots (fields, buildings, etc.) \n\nThis film is a very educational film. It gives you the sense of the time in many ways. But this film is not for everyone. It is a legal drama more than anything. I like that kind of thing, but many don't. If you like courtroom shows and like historical stories, this one is for you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-14","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,pubic hair,prison,male nudity","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381367/","name":"Nikola Rakocevic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0467451/","name":"Vuk Kostic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322977/","name":"Nebojsa Glogovac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464123/","name":"Srdjan Koljevic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232523/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464123/","name":"Srdjan Koljevic"}],"duration":"PT2H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The reason is that this is actually a TV show cut to make a film. This film also exists in an episodic format, with more minutes I believe.\n\nThe TV-quality is the biggest flaw with the film. The cinematography is not great. No attention is given to color grading. Lighting is also weak. Scenes in a prison cell at night have too much light. Camera movement is not good. The camera captures what's in front of it, but doesn't do what cinema cameras do - move, pan, tilt, etc. \n\nI'm not nitpicking. We have to mention these things because we want the cinema of Serbia to improve. These advanced ideas do exist in some Serbian films but not so much in Serbian TV, which is stuck in the 90's. So when someone makes a Serbian film out of a TV production, it looks old. Not 1914 old, but 1994 old.\n\nThe acting is good, but I'm surprised by the casting a little. Could they not find a German-speaking actor to play Rudy? Or someone not fluent in Serbo-Croatian to play the Czech Malek? Why is so little attention given to accents?\n\nI don't care if someone has a 2000's Belgrade accent when he's supposed to be a Bosnian peasant from 1914, but did Rudy really speak so fluently and eloquently in Serbo-Croatian? What about Malek? Couldn't they have brought a Slovene or someone with an imperfect accent?\n\nThose are my complaints.\n\nThe rest of the film is very, very good. The acting is convincing. There is no overacting or wooden acting. The music was good, but I felt that they could've given more time to music, either bands, radio or score. Music is a tool and it wasn't used much in this film. \n\nEverything looked convincing, like it was 1914. \n\nIt was well-researched and there were no short-cuts taken. \n\nIt did not fall to modern political bickering. I'm not going to call it a pro-Yugo film, but it felt like one (and that's a good thing in my book.) Many Slavs lived under Austro-Hungarian occupation and annexation and there were both Pro-Yugoslav and Pan-Slavic movements. It just happens that these boys decided to act on it.\n\nThere aren't enough shots of the country. A lot of stuff happens indoors. It's not hard to do establishing shots or mood setting exterior shots (fields, buildings, etc.) \n\nThis film is a very educational film. It gives you the sense of the time in many ways. But this film is not for everyone. It is a legal drama more than anything. I like that kind of thing, but many don't. If you like courtroom shows and like historical stories, this one is for you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-14","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,pubic hair,prison,male nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381367/","name":"Nikola Rakocevic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0467451/","name":"Vuk Kostic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322977/","name":"Nebojsa Glogovac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464123/","name":"Srdjan Koljevic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232523/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464123/","name":"Srdjan Koljevic"],"duration":"PT2H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The reason is that this is actually a TV show cut to make a film. This film also exists in an episodic format, with more minutes I believe.\n\nThe TV-quality is the biggest flaw with the film. The cinematography is not great. No attention is given to color grading. Lighting is also weak. Scenes in a prison cell at night have too much light. Camera movement is not good. The camera captures what's in front of it, but doesn't do what cinema cameras do - move, pan, tilt, etc. \n\nI'm not nitpicking. We have to mention these things because we want the cinema of Serbia to improve. These advanced ideas do exist in some Serbian films but not so much in Serbian TV, which is stuck in the 90's. So when someone makes a Serbian film out of a TV production, it looks old. Not 1914 old, but 1994 old.\n\nThe acting is good, but I'm surprised by the casting a little. Could they not find a German-speaking actor to play Rudy? Or someone not fluent in Serbo-Croatian to play the Czech Malek? Why is so little attention given to accents?\n\nI don't care if someone has a 2000's Belgrade accent when he's supposed to be a Bosnian peasant from 1914, but did Rudy really speak so fluently and eloquently in Serbo-Croatian? What about Malek? Couldn't they have brought a Slovene or someone with an imperfect accent?\n\nThose are my complaints.\n\nThe rest of the film is very, very good. The acting is convincing. There is no overacting or wooden acting. The music was good, but I felt that they could've given more time to music, either bands, radio or score. Music is a tool and it wasn't used much in this film. \n\nEverything looked convincing, like it was 1914. \n\nIt was well-researched and there were no short-cuts taken. \n\nIt did not fall to modern political bickering. I'm not going to call it a pro-Yugo film, but it felt like one (and that's a good thing in my book.) Many Slavs lived under Austro-Hungarian occupation and annexation and there were both Pro-Yugoslav and Pan-Slavic movements. It just happens that these boys decided to act on it.\n\nThere aren't enough shots of the country. A lot of stuff happens indoors. It's not hard to do establishing shots or mood setting exterior shots (fields, buildings, etc.) \n\nThis film is a very educational film. It gives you the sense of the time in many ways. But this film is not for everyone. It is a legal drama more than anything. I like that kind of thing, but many don't.

Was the Kragujevac Massacre precipitated by a Communist Partisan guerrilla attack against German troops?\n\nThis is how the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum describes the events that led up to the Kragujevac massacre: "In response to the capture of the 6th Company of the 920th Security (Landesschuetzen) Battalion by Cetnik resistance fighters in the town of Gorni Milanovac on 28 September 1941, the overall Wehrmacht commander in Serbia, General Franz Boehme, sent German troops to the area to carry out reprisal actions."\n\nAccording to this account, it was Chetnik guerrillas under Draza Mihailovich that sparked the events that followed. The movie seeks to be politically correct and reflects the Communist orthodoxy or ideology or Party line, however, that it was only the Partisans that were engaged in guerrilla activity. As a movie made during the height of the Communist dictatorship of Josip Broz Tito, this type of falsification is to be expected. The most glaring inaccuracy is with regard to the time of year depicted in the movie. The actual Kragujevac massacre occurred in the fall, October 21, 1941. In the movie, however, the time of year appears to be spring or summer with the corn fields just planted. The German tanks used in the movie appear to be inaccurate historically. The Germans used the Panzerkampfwagen Mark III and captured French Somua S35 tanks in the Kragujevac region in 1941. The tanks and personnel carriers used in the film appear to be improvised types that are not historically accurate. The German personnel carriers, in particular, stand out as anachronistic and ones not used by German forces at that time or place. The German tanks appear to be U.S. M4 Sherman E4 series medium tanks with 76 mm guns produced in the early 1950s which the U.S. shipped to Yugoslavia after the 1948 Stalin-Tito split for use in the Yugoslav Army. \n\nThere are other problems of historical accuracy as well. Why would the Germans broadcast on the radio a speech by Adolf Hitler from the 1934 documentary Triumph of the Will? In German? Moreover, Rudolf Hess is heard following the Hitler speech. Hess, however, had flown to Scotland on May 10, 1941 and been captured in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit Britain as an ally before the German invasion of the USSR. Clearly, historical accuracy, verisimilitude, and cinema verite are not high priorities of the movie. The screenwriter Branimir Jankovic is not a historian and the research involved was not very thorough or extensive.\n\nWere children executed? The Germans executed males between the ages of 16 to 60. In the movie, children under 16 are shown being executed. This was obviously for dramatic effect and to heighten the pathos and emotional impact.\n\nHow accurate is the number given of those killed at 8,000 men and boys? This number is obviously inaccurate and grossly inflated and was used by the Tito regime to hype up the massacre. The most recent determination of the number of persons killed in the massacre is 2,794 men shot, 415 in villages and 2,379 in the city of Kragujevac.\n\nThe movie is marred by the need to present the Communist Party line or historical orthodoxy on the events depicted. These instances are relatively brief in the movie. If one can overlook these intrusions, the movie works. The metaphor or theme of the movie is subservience or acquiescence to force or overwhelming power. Should one collaborate with the occupiers or should one resist? This is the overarching theme of the movie. The metaphor for this theme is the scene where German officers force the children to shine their shoes. The children choose defiance and resistance, choosing to die rather than to submit. On this level, the movie is successful in appealing to transcendent and universal human traits. Should one fight or should one submit? How do you respond to military occupation? Should one be a "traitor", "quisling", a "collaborator". Or should one resist and oppose force? In a movie, the choices are always easy or easier because actors do not die. They live to act in other movies. In real life, choices on whether to resist involve real consequences. Is it better to resist and to face death or is it better to endure occupation and oppression? One lives to fight another day. But most importantly, one lives, one survives. These can be difficult and controversial questions. But they are not ones that are presented only in movies and in fiction. These are universal human dilemmas that all people in any country and in any time can relate to. They are dilemmas that have always faced mankind and continue to do so. Can military occupation lead to peace and stability? In Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, and Bosnia? These are issues that still are relevant because they represent fundamental and transcendent human values.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["War"],"datePublished":"1969-10-17","keywords":"massacre,kragujevac,mass murder,german,child","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586759/","name":"Zorica Miladinovic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836267/","name":"Mira Stupica"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017988/","name":"Mija Aleksic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069692/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000507/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Was the Kragujevac Massacre precipitated by a Communist Partisan guerrilla attack against German troops?\n\nThis is how the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum describes the events that led up to the Kragujevac massacre: "In response to the capture of the 6th Company of the 920th Security (Landesschuetzen) Battalion by Cetnik resistance fighters in the town of Gorni Milanovac on 28 September 1941, the overall Wehrmacht commander in Serbia, General Franz Boehme, sent German troops to the area to carry out reprisal actions."\n\nAccording to this account, it was Chetnik guerrillas under Draza Mihailovich that sparked the events that followed. The movie seeks to be politically correct and reflects the Communist orthodoxy or ideology or Party line, however, that it was only the Partisans that were engaged in guerrilla activity. As a movie made during the height of the Communist dictatorship of Josip Broz Tito, this type of falsification is to be expected. The most glaring inaccuracy is with regard to the time of year depicted in the movie. The actual Kragujevac massacre occurred in the fall, October 21, 1941. In the movie, however, the time of year appears to be spring or summer with the corn fields just planted. The German tanks used in the movie appear to be inaccurate historically. The Germans used the Panzerkampfwagen Mark III and captured French Somua S35 tanks in the Kragujevac region in 1941. The tanks and personnel carriers used in the film appear to be improvised types that are not historically accurate. The German personnel carriers, in particular, stand out as anachronistic and ones not used by German forces at that time or place. The German tanks appear to be U.S. M4 Sherman E4 series medium tanks with 76 mm guns produced in the early 1950s which the U.S. shipped to Yugoslavia after the 1948 Stalin-Tito split for use in the Yugoslav Army. \n\nThere are other problems of historical accuracy as well. Why would the Germans broadcast on the radio a speech by Adolf Hitler from the 1934 documentary Triumph of the Will? In German? Moreover, Rudolf Hess is heard following the Hitler speech. Hess, however, had flown to Scotland on May 10, 1941 and been captured in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit Britain as an ally before the German invasion of the USSR. Clearly, historical accuracy, verisimilitude, and cinema verite are not high priorities of the movie. The screenwriter Branimir Jankovic is not a historian and the research involved was not very thorough or extensive.\n\nWere children executed? The Germans executed males between the ages of 16 to 60. In the movie, children under 16 are shown being executed. This was obviously for dramatic effect and to heighten the pathos and emotional impact.\n\nHow accurate is the number given of those killed at 8,000 men and boys? This number is obviously inaccurate and grossly inflated and was used by the Tito regime to hype up the massacre. The most recent determination of the number of persons killed in the massacre is 2,794 men shot, 415 in villages and 2,379 in the city of Kragujevac.\n\nThe movie is marred by the need to present the Communist Party line or historical orthodoxy on the events depicted. These instances are relatively brief in the movie. If one can overlook these intrusions, the movie works. The metaphor or theme of the movie is subservience or acquiescence to force or overwhelming power. Should one collaborate with the occupiers or should one resist? This is the overarching theme of the movie. The metaphor for this theme is the scene where German officers force the children to shine their shoes. The children choose defiance and resistance, choosing to die rather than to submit. On this level, the movie is successful in appealing to transcendent and universal human traits. Should one fight or should one submit? How do you respond to military occupation? Should one be a "traitor", "quisling", a "collaborator". Or should one resist and oppose force?

These are issues that still are relevant because they represent fundamental and transcendent human values.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["War"],"datePublished":"1969-10-17","keywords":"massacre,kragujevac,mass murder,german,child","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586759/","name":"Zorica Miladinovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836267/","name":"Mira Stupica","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017988/","name":"Mija Aleksic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000507/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film was made to look cool, sound cool, and define cool. Yeah, okay, the MiG-28s are really F-5 Tigers; I've read the 'goofs' section before. And Tom Cruise's height. And about 'Maverick going supersonic - I'll be there in 30 seconds,' and the laws of physics preventing him from covering 200 or so miles from the carrier in that time. Whatever! So what! If Top Gun had tried to be accurate and true-to-life in every respect, it would have been some oh-so-serious flick like Courage Under Fire. Here's some examples of what I mean:\n\n1 - what's the best way to evade cannon fire? Do a snazzy barrel roll. Problem solved!\n\n2 - the MiG pilots have tinted visors. The good guys don't. Go figure.\n\n2.5 - Russian planes are actually grey or green. The MiG 28s are black. The Tomcats are... yeah, you guessed it... white! Good vs. Evil.\n\n3 - Modern air-to-air combat is usually fought at distances of tens of miles between aircraft. Top Gun uses much cooler spitting-distance WWI era tactics.\n\n4 - "It's too close for missiles. I'm switching to guns!" Enough said.\n\n5 - the generic guy carrying coffee who gets knocked over by the fuming air-control officer. We never see him get up. Classic.\n\n6 - even the edited TV version is a few steps above normal-cool. "... you'll be flying a cargo plane [edit]... out of Hong Kong!"\n\n7 - the way Iceman says, "Mayday, Mav's in trouble. He's in a flat spin, and heading out to sea."\n\n8 - the graceful way Top Gun maintained a PG rating, without using the F-word once.\n\nTop Gun came out in 1986. That's 1986. Seventeen years ago. It rocked then... it rocks now. Just watch it and have some fun.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":315098,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"1986-05-16","keywords":"pilot,flying,flight school,jet,male objectification","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3442321177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNzExNjIzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA5NzAwOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNzExNjIzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA5NzAwOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the trailer for the 3D re-release of Top Gun.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000209/","name":"Tim Robbins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000534/","name":"Kelly McGillis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0143596/","name":"Jim Cash","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0258390/","name":"Jack Epps Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1274594/","name":"Ehud Yonay"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.\n\nThere are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story.\n\nFinally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world. \n\nFrom the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion!\n\nwww.themadmovieman.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":358376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-08-12","keywords":"spy,rogue agent,computer hacker,mission,capture","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3396513817","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTM2NDU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwNTUwNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTM2NDU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwNTUwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272581/","name":"Rebecca Ferguson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719637/","name":"Jeremy Renner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021593/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1510800/","name":"Drew Pearce"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.\n\nThere are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story.\n\nFinally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world. \n\nFrom the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion!\n\nwww.themadmovieman.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":358376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-08-12","keywords":"spy,rogue agent,computer hacker,mission,capture","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3396513817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTM2NDU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwNTUwNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTM2NDU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwNTUwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272581/","name":"Rebecca Ferguson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719637/","name":"Jeremy Renner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021593/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1510800/","name":"Drew Pearce"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building.

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them.

However a group of terrorists, led by ex-IMF agent Ambrose also want the disease so that they can us it to infect the world as they have already got the only cure.  Hunt turns to jewel thief Nyah to help him by infiltrating her ex-lover's (Ambrose) group to spy on them.\n\nJohn Woo must have thought of the elements he needed to follow up the solid thrills of the original movie.  Big action scenes? Yes.  Slow-motion? Yes. Plot?  Characters?  Good theme music?  Logic of any kind?  Nope  won't be needing those!  Or at least that's how it felt.  The plot of the first film was clever despite being open to holes  the plot here makes the first one look like a watertight piece of genius!  The story only really serves to set up action scenes and the like  I can barely remember the disease and can only recall rubbish action scenes!\n\nFor a director like John Woo I knew to expect slow-mo and OTT action, but I didn't know that it would all be so very superficial and weak.  For example the car chase where Hunt and Nyah meet is just ridiculous and very annoying. The robbery of the disease is a pale shadow of the original film's robbery scene and the final motorbike chase is good but only a hint of what Woo has done before.  The plot overuses the whole `face mask' thing  it must do it about 8 or 9 times  many of those time's there's no way Hunt could have made a mask of the people involved!  It's another example of how silly it is.\n\nWhile Cruise was cool in the first film, here he is slick and tough  an image that doesn't work.  He was much better in the first film.  Scott is non-existent as a villain and is pretty dull.  Newton is sexy but no more than that.  Rhames is good and Hopkins has an enjoyable minor role.\n\nOverall this film is an OTT mess.  The plot is a shambles and the action scenes are silly and often have no logical reason behind them!  The overuse of the face masks just points to the total lack of a good script and Woo's slow motion just feels tired and unimaginative.  Only the final action scene is enjoyable, but by then you're ony interesting in turning this off and watching De Palma's much better film instead."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328995,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-05-24","keywords":"finger cut off,ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,time bomb,slit skirt","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779084/","name":"Dougray Scott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000247/","name":"John Woo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194528/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

However a group of terrorists, led by ex-IMF agent Ambrose also want the disease so that they can us it to infect the world as they have already got the only cure.  Hunt turns to jewel thief Nyah to help him by infiltrating her ex-lover's (Ambrose) group to spy on them.\n\nJohn Woo must have thought of the elements he needed to follow up the solid thrills of the original movie.  Big action scenes? Yes.  Slow-motion? Yes. Plot?  Characters?  Good theme music?  Logic of any kind?  Nope  won't be needing those!  Or at least that's how it felt.  The plot of the first film was clever despite being open to holes  the plot here makes the first one look like a watertight piece of genius!  The story only really serves to set up action scenes and the like  I can barely remember the disease and can only recall rubbish action scenes!\n\nFor a director like John Woo I knew to expect slow-mo and OTT action, but I didn't know that it would all be so very superficial and weak.  For example the car chase where Hunt and Nyah meet is just ridiculous and very annoying. The robbery of the disease is a pale shadow of the original film's robbery scene and the final motorbike chase is good but only a hint of what Woo has done before.  The plot overuses the whole `face mask' thing  it must do it about 8 or 9 times  many of those time's there's no way Hunt could have made a mask of the people involved!  It's another example of how silly it is.\n\nWhile Cruise was cool in the first film, here he is slick and tough  an image that doesn't work.  He was much better in the first film.  Scott is non-existent as a villain and is pretty dull.  Newton is sexy but no more than that.  Rhames is good and Hopkins has an enjoyable minor role.\n\nOverall this film is an OTT mess.  The plot is a shambles and the action scenes are silly and often have no logical reason behind them!  The overuse of the face masks just points to the total lack of a good script and Woo's slow motion just feels tired and unimaginative.  Only the final action scene is enjoyable, but by then you're ony interesting in turning this off and watching De Palma's much better film instead.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":328995,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-05-24","keywords":"finger cut off,ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,time bomb,slit skirt","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779084/","name":"Dougray Scott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000247/","name":"John Woo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194528/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

An acceptable noir film produced by actor Andrew Stevens , Elie Samaha and professionally directed by Stephen Kay (Boogeyman , The last time I committed suicide), though with no originality . An extremely tough movie burdened by cruel murders and seedy characters , based on a novel titled 'Get Carter' by Ted Lewis from 1970 . This brutal , austere crime-thriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter (hard-working star Sylvester Stallone) , a tough , amoral gangster who works as a killer in Los Angeles . Passable Sylvester Stallone in the title role , but inferior to Michael Caine (he played Jack Carter in the original) here playing a secondary role as Cliff Brumby (his character was only in one scene in the original cut, but test audiences said they liked him and they transformed the movie to have Caine as the bad guy) . Here Stallone is a hit-man who returns home to investigate his brother's death by some mobsters .As he decides to travel his natal Seattle to investigate who is responsible ; Jack contends enemies , but he stands a head above fellow hoods , but not apart from them . Two-fisted Jack in order to revenge his sibling , vows vengeance and spontaneously meets sleazy characters (bad ass Mickey Rourke and nasty computer magnate Alan Cummings) in the middle of sinister bands war and running afoul into underworld . When his brother dies under mysterious circumstances in a car accident , gangster Jack Carter travels to Seattle to investigate and reunites his widow (Miranda Richardson and niece (Rachael Leigh Cook) and he subsequently meets ominous characters who may have been involved . Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a "gang" opponent led by a mobster . We see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant mob gentleman with exquisite manners , educated pose , and expensive costumes , begins collapsing , leaving see the lascivious, malleability and a cold killer . Carter starts moving in this ambient but all of this ends in a shocking discovery delivered by a compact disc which greatly angers Carter . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in Seattle . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta.

An acceptable noir film produced by actor Andrew Stevens , Elie Samaha and professionally directed by Stephen Kay (Boogeyman , The last time I committed suicide), though with no originality . An extremely tough movie burdened by cruel murders and seedy characters , based on a novel titled 'Get Carter' by Ted Lewis from 1970 . This brutal , austere crime-thriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter (hard-working star Sylvester Stallone) , a tough , amoral gangster who works as a killer in Los Angeles . Passable Sylvester Stallone in the title role , but inferior to Michael Caine (he played Jack Carter in the original) here playing a secondary role as Cliff Brumby (his character was only in one scene in the original cut, but test audiences said they liked him and they transformed the movie to have Caine as the bad guy) . Here Stallone is a hit-man who returns home to investigate his brother's death by some mobsters .As he decides to travel his natal Seattle to investigate who is responsible ; Jack contends enemies , but he stands a head above fellow hoods , but not apart from them . Two-fisted Jack in order to revenge his sibling , vows vengeance and spontaneously meets sleazy characters (bad ass Mickey Rourke and nasty computer magnate Alan Cummings) in the middle of sinister bands war and running afoul into underworld . When his brother dies under mysterious circumstances in a car accident , gangster Jack Carter travels to Seattle to investigate and reunites his widow (Miranda Richardson and niece (Rachael Leigh Cook) and he subsequently meets ominous characters who may have been involved . Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a "gang" opponent led by a mobster . We see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant mob gentleman with exquisite manners , educated pose , and expensive costumes , begins collapsing , leaving see the lascivious, malleability and a cold killer . Carter starts moving in this ambient but all of this ends in a shocking discovery delivered by a compact disc which greatly angers Carter . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in Seattle . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta. The end of the film is like a summary of the entire story for the scenarios that uses austere bleak and cold environment .\n\nThis interesting film features thrills , well-staged car chases , raw energy , adult subject matter , clunking cruelty surrounding , lots of violence and enlivened by high-powered performances .

Igor is taken in by Victor Frankenstein; His life flips upside down, they become a team, and we, the audience continue to follow the adventures, as well as embodiment of these two characters, as they both create a scientific breakthrough. Or in this case, reanimation. Honestly, I found this movie to be a little misspoken for. I can see where many were expecting non - stop occurrences with the reanimated creature we've all come to know and love. Before anything else of this review, there is little of that. But here's the thing, does that make this entire thing bad? No. This film was actually creative, and quite good. First off, I honestly love the charm, and creativity of this story. The entire execution of the film's telling of this entire tale, I found to be flawless. The entire telling fell within the amazing character chemistry between Igor, and Victor. Which, by the way, both Daniel Radcliffe, and James McAvoy had amazing chemistry together. You could watch, and feel the connection their characters, if that, actors shared together. The characters in this film, while on the topic, were all around great. I can't emphasize this enough, horror, if that, thriller's now, usually have unlikeable characters - But not here. This film has characters that you could actually bare with, characters that'll you'll grow to, and actually bond with, sharing feelings for their actions. Of course, however, you have a small collection of characters you grow to dislike, but of course by intend of the film itself. I personally found the entire, overall plot, and storyline to be charming. I found the rescue, and bonding of savior friendship between Igor, and Victor to be all around charming, and just flat out awesome. It thrills us, audience, while at the same time develop feelings for the characters. Moving to visual elements, first of all, I honestly loved the entire visual effects of this film. I felt as if it was beautiful, and succeeded in giving us a flat out, solid display of the Victorian era, or in other words steam-punk. It felt intriguing to look at, visual eye-candy as far as the eye can see, giving an attention - grabbing effect. The camera work compliments as well, giving us some pretty well placed shots of which show the action sequences, as well as the meaningful ones. Lastly. I honestly liked the creations. The re-animated figures looked distorted, something they're supposed to succeed at. It didn't look cheap, and honestly was great for the time they came around, with their grotesque features, not too gory, or disgusting, but at the same time not too light, or cheap. \n\nIn conclusion, this film succeeds in a pleasant surprise. Once again, I can see where people get disappointed, as we see barely any real "Frankenstein" or in this case, the reanimated monster, at least not as much as many may of expected. However, the film succeeded in dismissing that, as we're giving many succeeding elements, including stunning visual effects, great, likable characters.

Igor is taken in by Victor Frankenstein; His life flips upside down, they become a team, and we, the audience continue to follow the adventures, as well as embodiment of these two characters, as they both create a scientific breakthrough. Or in this case, reanimation. Honestly, I found this movie to be a little misspoken for. I can see where many were expecting non - stop occurrences with the reanimated creature we've all come to know and love. Before anything else of this review, there is little of that. But here's the thing, does that make this entire thing bad? No. This film was actually creative, and quite good. First off, I honestly love the charm, and creativity of this story. The entire execution of the film's telling of this entire tale, I found to be flawless. The entire telling fell within the amazing character chemistry between Igor, and Victor. Which, by the way, both Daniel Radcliffe, and James McAvoy had amazing chemistry together. You could watch, and feel the connection their characters, if that, actors shared together. The characters in this film, while on the topic, were all around great. I can't emphasize this enough, horror, if that, thriller's now, usually have unlikeable characters - But not here. This film has characters that you could actually bare with, characters that'll you'll grow to, and actually bond with, sharing feelings for their actions. Of course, however, you have a small collection of characters you grow to dislike, but of course by intend of the film itself. I personally found the entire, overall plot, and storyline to be charming. I found the rescue, and bonding of savior friendship between Igor, and Victor to be all around charming, and just flat out awesome. It thrills us, audience, while at the same time develop feelings for the characters. Moving to visual elements, first of all, I honestly loved the entire visual effects of this film. I felt as if it was beautiful, and succeeded in giving us a flat out, solid display of the Victorian era, or in other words steam-punk. It felt intriguing to look at, visual eye-candy as far as the eye can see, giving an attention - grabbing effect. The camera work compliments as well, giving us some pretty well placed shots of which show the action sequences, as well as the meaningful ones. Lastly. I honestly liked the creations. The re-animated figures looked distorted, something they're supposed to succeed at. It didn't look cheap, and honestly was great for the time they came around, with their grotesque features, not too gory, or disgusting, but at the same time not too light, or cheap. \n\nIn conclusion, this film succeeds in a pleasant surprise. Once again, I can see where people get disappointed, as we see barely any real "Frankenstein" or in this case, the reanimated monster, at least not as much as many may of expected. However, the film succeeded in dismissing that, as we're giving many succeeding elements, including stunning visual effects, great, likable characters. I fun, at the same time thrilling story, and an overall unique charm that doesn't disappoint. Although, as said before this wasn't a strong "horror" but for what it was, aside the dismiss of the appearances of monsters, this was a fun film, enjoyable, and over all fantastic.

Igor is taken in by Victor Frankenstein; His life flips upside down, they become a team, and we, the audience continue to follow the adventures, as well as embodiment of these two characters, as they both create a scientific breakthrough. Or in this case, reanimation. Honestly, I found this movie to be a little misspoken for. I can see where many were expecting non - stop occurrences with the reanimated creature we've all come to know and love. Before anything else of this review, there is little of that. But here's the thing, does that make this entire thing bad? No. This film was actually creative, and quite good. First off, I honestly love the charm, and creativity of this story. The entire execution of the film's telling of this entire tale, I found to be flawless. The entire telling fell within the amazing character chemistry between Igor, and Victor. Which, by the way, both Daniel Radcliffe, and James McAvoy had amazing chemistry together. You could watch, and feel the connection their characters, if that, actors shared together. The characters in this film, while on the topic, were all around great. I can't emphasize this enough, horror, if that, thriller's now, usually have unlikeable characters - But not here. This film has characters that you could actually bare with, characters that'll you'll grow to, and actually bond with, sharing feelings for their actions. Of course, however, you have a small collection of characters you grow to dislike, but of course by intend of the film itself. I personally found the entire, overall plot, and storyline to be charming. I found the rescue, and bonding of savior friendship between Igor, and Victor to be all around charming, and just flat out awesome. It thrills us, audience, while at the same time develop feelings for the characters. Moving to visual elements, first of all, I honestly loved the entire visual effects of this film. I felt as if it was beautiful, and succeeded in giving us a flat out, solid display of the Victorian era, or in other words steam-punk. It felt intriguing to look at, visual eye-candy as far as the eye can see, giving an attention - grabbing effect. The camera work compliments as well, giving us some pretty well placed shots of which show the action sequences, as well as the meaningful ones. Lastly. I honestly liked the creations. The re-animated figures looked distorted, something they're supposed to succeed at. It didn't look cheap, and honestly was great for the time they came around, with their grotesque features, not too gory, or disgusting, but at the same time not too light, or cheap. \n\nIn conclusion, this film succeeds in a pleasant surprise. Once again, I can see where people get disappointed, as we see barely any real "Frankenstein" or in this case, the reanimated monster, at least not as much as many may of expected. However, the film succeeded in dismissing that, as we're giving many succeeding elements, including stunning visual effects, great, likable characters. I fun, at the same time thrilling story, and an overall unique charm that doesn't disappoint. Although, as said before this wasn't a strong "horror" but for what it was, aside the dismiss of the appearances of monsters, this was a fun film, enjoyable, and over all fantastic. I'd highly recommend this one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55499,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-12-02","keywords":"frankenstein's monster,scientist,gothic horror,based on novel,assistant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3739136793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Nzc3NjY0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMzOTg1NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Nzc3NjY0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMzOTg1NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for Victor Frankenstein.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564215/","name":"James McAvoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3726887/","name":"Jessica Brown Findlay"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006476/","name":"Paul McGuigan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016492/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0484840/","name":"Max Landis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0791217/","name":"Mary Shelley"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film is no exception, it follows the other films like in the exact same regard. But I do think this is an improvement from Dark of the Moon and a BIG improvement from the horrid, Revenge of the Fallen. The film takes a bit more serious approach, but don't get me wrong it still has some stupid humor, just not as much as the previous films, which is pretty refreshing. \n\nThe action scenes in here are pretty outstanding and it actually has much more wide shots than the previous movies. You can actually see the large scale of these giant robots in breathtaking detail. The visual- effects are fantastic as they usually are with these films, it definitely delivers in that department. However as usual there are numerous problems with the script and story, it's senseless as usual, but not as annoying as "Revenge of the Fallen", the dialogue is weak, but at least it's not mindbogglingly stupid. Also the Autobots and even the Decepticons have more of a personality than they used to. Grimlock is a fantastic addition in this film, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more of him. \n\nFor those who didn't care for Michael Bay's past Transformers films, you probably won't like this because it has even more mindless extravaganza action packed scenes, just like the other films did. However audiences who are game to board the extravagance train will find that Age of Extinction hits all the notes that a Transformers movie ought to. So if you didn't like any of the other past Transformers movies, don't bother watching this cause you'll probably won't become fan after this. If you liked the other ones then you'll most likely be in for a fun ride like I was.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":306975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-07-23","keywords":"blockbuster,based on tv series,truck,texas,semi truck and trailer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3138759961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mjg3NDY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExOTE4MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mjg3NDY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExOTE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An automobile mechanic and his daughter make a discovery that brings down the Autobots and Decepticons - and a paranoid government official - on them.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2443758/","name":"Nicola Peltz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2930503/","name":"Jack Reynor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130376/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472567/","name":"Ehren Kruger"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film is no exception, it follows the other films like in the exact same regard. But I do think this is an improvement from Dark of the Moon and a BIG improvement from the horrid, Revenge of the Fallen. The film takes a bit more serious approach, but don't get me wrong it still has some stupid humor, just not as much as the previous films, which is pretty refreshing. \n\nThe action scenes in here are pretty outstanding and it actually has much more wide shots than the previous movies. You can actually see the large scale of these giant robots in breathtaking detail. The visual- effects are fantastic as they usually are with these films, it definitely delivers in that department. However as usual there are numerous problems with the script and story, it's senseless as usual, but not as annoying as "Revenge of the Fallen", the dialogue is weak, but at least it's not mindbogglingly stupid. Also the Autobots and even the Decepticons have more of a personality than they used to. Grimlock is a fantastic addition in this film, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more of him. \n\nFor those who didn't care for Michael Bay's past Transformers films, you probably won't like this because it has even more mindless extravaganza action packed scenes, just like the other films did. However audiences who are game to board the extravagance train will find that Age of Extinction hits all the notes that a Transformers movie ought to. So if you didn't like any of the other past Transformers movies, don't bother watching this cause you'll probably won't become fan after this. If you liked the other ones then you'll most likely be in for a fun ride like I was.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":306975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-07-23","keywords":"blockbuster,based on tv series,truck,texas,semi truck and trailer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3138759961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mjg3NDY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExOTE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mjg3NDY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExOTE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An automobile mechanic and his daughter make a discovery that brings down the Autobots and Decepticons - and a paranoid government official - on them.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2443758/","name":"Nicola Peltz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2930503/","name":"Jack Reynor"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130376/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472567/","name":"Ehren Kruger"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Konstantin je priča o detektivu natrprirodnih moći, Džonu Konstantin (Kianu Rivs), koji je doslovno otišao u pakao i vratio se. Kada se Konstantin udruži sa skeptičnom policajkom Ejndželom Dodson (Rejčel Vajs) radi rešenja slučaja tajanstvenog samobistva njene sestre bliznakinje (koju takođe glumi Vajsova), istraga ih vodi kroz svet demona i anđela koji se nalazi ispod površine grada Los Anđelesa. Zarobljeni u katastrofalnom nizu natprirodnih događaja, njih dvoje više nemaju izlaza i žele da nađu sopstveni mir po svaku cenu.</desc>

With that said let me add, this movie will not insult yours, if you see it with the right attitude. Adrenaline pump set for full tilt boogie. This is not an intellectual movie, it is not a love story, and it certainly is not Rambo. What it is, is a series of action shorts connected by a common thread that is very much in vogue. Good guys vs. bad guys/terrorists and in so doing, overcome insurmountable odds to, 1. Do the " right thing " 2. Save the day, 3.Have a hell of a time doing it and 4. GET THE GIRL! If, you expect anymore than that, you will be disappointed. So, turn off you brain and enjoy the ride.

With that said let me add, this movie will not insult yours, if you see it with the right attitude. Adrenaline pump set for full tilt boogie. This is not an intellectual movie, it is not a love story, and it certainly is not Rambo. What it is, is a series of action shorts connected by a common thread that is very much in vogue. Good guys vs. bad guys/terrorists and in so doing, overcome insurmountable odds to, 1. Do the " right thing " 2. Save the day, 3.Have a hell of a time doing it and 4. GET THE GIRL! If, you expect anymore than that, you will be disappointed. So, turn off you brain and enjoy the ride.

Yes, there are like Ice Cube in the film, but the whole narration was presented from the Charlie's viewpoint. This story needed strong voice, but he had none.

I like Cube in comedies than the serious roles.\n\nWell, it's not about the story, it's just a one day event. The final day of the school and a tough day for all. Because some of the staffs were fired from the job, the students' misconduct peaked, it's totally a messy day. The English teacher, Campbell, gets into a fight for going against his co-staff. So the day goes on as the countdown begins for their most anticipated fight at the final bell of the school. The preparation for that and all other craziness take place before the finale.\n\nWhen the film started, it was like any other B movie, very familiar atmosphere and predictable. Once the second half kick-started, I felt it was getting better. And the climax was even better. So, it ended strongly, after a so-so opening. Till that end, I did not think it deserved a decent respect, but at the end a better one. With this kind of cast and thematic, the film was much better. Really a well made, nothing more than on the entertainment perspective. So, if that's your sole purpose to watch a film, then this is the right one. Go for it.

I originally gave this movie 3 stars, but changed it to 4 just because I actually like those little furry guys - it's not really their fault that the writers, producers and directors made a couple of BIG mistakes during this movie. In a G movies there IS NOT supposed to be suggestive remarks or anything below the belt of ANY kind and there was three of those: #1 Dave gets hot coffee spilled on his crotch. #2 Alvis shouts "My acorns!" #3 Zoe says "I just gotta wrap up my balls." As mentioned in another review - Zoe is the worst character and a mental case rip off from Cast away... they really blew it there, but she can dance! As also pointed out in another review - too MUCH singing with those squeaky high voices and in the wrong places. All in all the movie is okay, a bit corny and nothing I would buy on DVD.

I didn't actually see "Mickey Blue Eyes" until 2006, and by then, I knew it wasn't the most highly acclaimed comedy of all time, so I wasn't expecting to be blown away. However, I was hoping for at least a moderately funny spoof movie, and from what I remember, that was what I got. About 2 ½ years later, I've seen it a second time, and while I was still entertained by a good chunk of the film, it may not have been quite the same as before.\n\nMichael Felgate is an art auctioneer from England who currently resides in New York, and is dating a teacher named Gina Vitale. He wants to marry her, but doesn't know about her family! She has relatives, including her father, Frank Vitale, who are members of the Mafia, and this is why she turns down Michael's proposal, as she is afraid that if they marry, he will be lured into the world of organized crime! Michael promises not to let that happen, but this is easier said than done! After they are engaged, Michael finds himself involved in a money laundering, and finds himself questioned by suspicious FBI agents, but he must play along with this scheme in order to survive! It gets worse when Gina accidentally kills the son of a mob boss, and Michael decides to take the blame! \n\nThe first scene in the film that stands out as really funny to me is the one where the owner of a Chinese restaurant stands at the table where Michael and Gina are sitting, and makes sure Gina eats her fortune cookie. For quite a while, the film goes fairly steadily, sometimes mildly amusing, and sometimes more than that. Another major comic highlight I can't forget is Michael having to pose as a gangster known as "Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes" and having to try and speak with a New York Italian accent! The humour is not enough to carry the film, but there is also suspense, which definitely helps. For probably most of the film, it looked like my second viewing would be like my first, but I found that it started to lose its charm towards the end, I'm not sure why, but I was not left fully satisfied. Anyway, I would say this movie certainly doesn't fail miserably as a comedy, but as such, it certainly could have been funnier, though the story and suspense often makes up for that. There are much worse comedies out there, but I can see why "Mickey Blue Eyes" isn't as popular as "Analyze This", a mob spoof which came out the same year.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36202,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"1999-08-20","keywords":"mafia,character name as title,nickname as title,movie flop,fbi federal bureau of investigation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi369212953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4ODc1NWEtYWQ2ZC00YjczLThlMmEtZGFjOWE5ZjU3MzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4ODc1NWEtYWQ2ZC00YjczLThlMmEtZGFjOWE5ZjU3MzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000675/","name":"Jeanne Tripplehorn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538614/","name":"Kelly Makin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331956/","name":"Carl Gottlieb"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033739/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770649/","name":"Adam Scheinman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002675/","name":"Robert Kuhn"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There were so many funny jokes made by Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker; and Hugh Grant's accent and phrases are hysterical. For example, in the beginning the Federal Marshall tells Sarah Jessica Parker she has to make a choice between dying and leaving New York and there is a long pause as they all stare at her and she says, "Hold on I'm thinking." I think the combination of them together was very funny. Also, if you have ever lived in a big city or a very rural area - you can identify with this! I love their interactions with Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen. In another scene, Hugh Grant is served a plate of eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries covered in country gravy by Mary Steenburger and she asks him if he needs anything else, and he replies, "Just an angiogram." They are complete opposites. Plus I am sure there are many women out there who can sympathize with Sarah Jessica Parker's character. I recommend giving this movie a chance!!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39786,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-01-27","keywords":"family character name in title,six word title,columbia tristar,movie flop,fbi federal bureau of investigation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Did You Hear About the Morgans? -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008890137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjY4ODM4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwOTk5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjY4ODM4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwOTk5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, an estranged couple (Grant and Parker) who witness a murder are relocated to small-town Wyoming as part of a witness-protection program."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There were so many funny jokes made by Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker; and Hugh Grant's accent and phrases are hysterical. For example, in the beginning the Federal Marshall tells Sarah Jessica Parker she has to make a choice between dying and leaving New York and there is a long pause as they all stare at her and she says, "Hold on I'm thinking." I think the combination of them together was very funny. Also, if you have ever lived in a big city or a very rural area - you can identify with this! I love their interactions with Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen. In another scene, Hugh Grant is served a plate of eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries covered in country gravy by Mary Steenburger and she asks him if he needs anything else, and he replies, "Just an angiogram." They are complete opposites. Plus I am sure there are many women out there who can sympathize with Sarah Jessica Parker's character. I recommend giving this movie a chance!!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39786,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-01-27","keywords":"family character name in title,six word title,columbia tristar,movie flop,fbi federal bureau of investigation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Did You Hear About the Morgans? -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008890137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjY4ODM4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwOTk5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjY4ODM4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwOTk5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, an estranged couple (Grant and Parker) who witness a murder are relocated to small-town Wyoming as part of a witness-protection program.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">The Internship: Directed by Shawn Levy. With Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rose Byrne, Aasif Mandvi. Two salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital age find their way into a coveted internship at Google, where they must compete with a group of young, tech-savvy geniuses for a shot at employment." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2234155/","name":"The Internship","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MzczMDgwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4NjM2OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital age find their way into a coveted internship at Google, where they must compete with a group of young, tech-savvy geniuses for a shot at employment.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2234155/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"rgkarim"},"dateCreated":"2013-06-07","inLanguage":"English","name":"Fun, but Not Number One","reviewBody":"Hello all and once again it's Robbie K reporting in with another movie. This time I'm coming at you with the Internship, the latest comedy starring that dynamic duo Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who entertained us with Wedding Crashers. Well it seems eight years later the team who helped make that fun comedy have returned to make what many are calling a remake/ knock off of the "romantic" comedy. Is it true, or is there more to this movie than meets the eye? Please read on to hear my opinions. \n\nI'll agree that there are many similarities to the plot of Wedding Crashers. The two smooth talkers seem to be living the dream, until something happens to derail their train and send them on a new path that is for the better. Instead of banging babes and finding true love though, this time it's more about taking a chance and bridging a gap between generations all the while addressing the trials within. This is where one of my strengths of this movie comes in, the relevance of the plot to me. The Internship addresses big problems that faces many today, the security and safety of a job and the challenge that our culture has become. Being a student currently going through similar trials, I found the production team did a good job showing the various struggles that the younger generation faces, and their accompanying Impressing parents, cynical approaches to problems, the substitution of technology for life, and many more issues are all well integrated into this movie to drive the point across. Lucky for the audience it's not done in too cheesy a manner that it makes you think it's an 80's/90's sitcom. Something else I liked was the fact that all of the characters in their intern group had a problem, which allowed for yes you guessed it BALANCE, which we all know I like. Of course it's not just solely a bunch of smart college kids pulling miracles out of the air, and complaining about their problems. No Vaughn and Wilson's characters have their own problems that they had to face as they get integrated into a new world that the younger generation seems to run. Now we've seen these problems before I won't lie, but there is some fresh chemistry between the older generation and newer generation that shows off a dual teacher-student relationship. \n\nWith limited space let's move on to the comedy. The Internship switches gears from odd/awkward sex scenarios that floods the dialog and bounces into the land of stereotypical nerds, generation gaps, and new experiences that go a different route. For me this allowed for some balance in humor, with many of the "inspirational" speeches and geek events making me laugh at points through the movie. Character references from star wars, insults using computer vernacular, and dressing up as literature with some pizazz await those who go to this movie, so be ready for this humor. I like the diversity, and some of the creativity these guys did, but from the responses of the other audience members that wasn't the same case. Don't worry though they still laughed, but more so on the sexual situations that still appear a good number of times. As for the older generation, the team also digs up some references from the previous decades, which although were sometimes over my head, still entertained the audience and me at points. However, this could have been due to the delivery of the lines and acting that went with it.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, the acting. Like Wedding Crashers Vaughn and Wilson are the same duo that entertained us years ago, delivering their lines in the same manner as they did back then. Vaughn delivers his lines at a rapid pace in a jumbled, hyper mess that has random words flying through the air. Wilson joins him in the stamped of words, but then brought sarcasm to the table to retaliate some of the quips thrown at him. Not one to be backed down, Vaughn would come right back with his spin on sarcastic dialog and usually throw in his natural, goofy face that brought the finishing punch to the humor. However, this is what these guys almost always do in their comedies, which means that if you are tired of this chemistry then you probably don't want to see this movie, because you might get annoyed with the brotherhood these two share. Yet there are other props due to some of the other cast members. The lovely Rose Byrne is a combination of beauty and good acting as she adds an Australian accent into mix and plays more of the love story part, yet her character is a step down from her previous parts. Josh Brener, the phone commercial guy, had a fun character as well, being the classic and hopeful nerd with a goal that seems impossible. As for the "bad" guy of this movie, Max Minghella did a nice job adding some British edge to the villain, but for the most part it was the same character with more bite and computer skills, than political bark. The rest of the group is fine, each doing a good job at the role they are playing and looking the part in every scene. \n\nThe Internship is a fun summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. While it is definitely not the most original movie, there are plenty of jokes to keep you laughing and having fun, no matter what generation you are from. However, there are a lot of similarities, primarily the acting, that this movie has and I will say is a somewhat knock off of Wedding Crashers. If you are looking for a fun group movie or just some mindless fun, well consider this film; otherwise wait for Redbox for this film.

I read very good reviews of it and was interested to see it. Even if did not turn out to be what the reviews say (that happens quite often) I would had been fine.\n\nThe story is shown through the eyes of 11 year old boy Tommi (Alessandro Morace), who stays in an urban lower middle class dis-jointed family with his unemployed cameraman father Renato (Kim Rossi Stuart) and sister Viola (Marta Nobili). His mother Stefania (Barbora Bobulova) has left the family for some other man. Even in the dis-functional family where it is difficult to meet expenses and ends, Renato with all his frustrations, still loves the kids a lot. Parallel to this are two sub-plot running  one, where Renato wants his son Tommi to be a swimmer, whereas Tommi wants to become a football player. Second, the school life of Tommi  where he tries to seek friendship and love with his classmates. When Stefania suddenly appears one day out of no where back to the family  after a bit of test and trials  there is hope, happiness in the family. But again suddenly she disappears and leaves behind the traumatic family in despair.\n\nThis is the first time directorial debut of the very good looking famous Italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart. After his long acting career he does great justice to his new role as a Director. I read that he was not suppose to act in this movie, and only direct the movie; but just 15 days before the shooting  when the selected actor left the movie, the producers persuaded Kim to take the role of the father. Kim looks stunning, very pleasing to the eyes and has acted efficiently well. I think after a long time, I personally have seen some real good looks on screen. But I will leave it on girls and women to add more.\n\nBut the movie belongs wholly and solely to Alessandro Morace.

I read very good reviews of it and was interested to see it. Even if did not turn out to be what the reviews say (that happens quite often) I would had been fine.\n\nThe story is shown through the eyes of 11 year old boy Tommi (Alessandro Morace), who stays in an urban lower middle class dis-jointed family with his unemployed cameraman father Renato (Kim Rossi Stuart) and sister Viola (Marta Nobili). His mother Stefania (Barbora Bobulova) has left the family for some other man. Even in the dis-functional family where it is difficult to meet expenses and ends, Renato with all his frustrations, still loves the kids a lot. Parallel to this are two sub-plot running  one, where Renato wants his son Tommi to be a swimmer, whereas Tommi wants to become a football player. Second, the school life of Tommi  where he tries to seek friendship and love with his classmates. When Stefania suddenly appears one day out of no where back to the family  after a bit of test and trials  there is hope, happiness in the family. But again suddenly she disappears and leaves behind the traumatic family in despair.\n\nThis is the first time directorial debut of the very good looking famous Italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart. After his long acting career he does great justice to his new role as a Director. I read that he was not suppose to act in this movie, and only direct the movie; but just 15 days before the shooting  when the selected actor left the movie, the producers persuaded Kim to take the role of the father. Kim looks stunning, very pleasing to the eyes and has acted efficiently well. I think after a long time, I personally have seen some real good looks on screen. But I will leave it on girls and women to add more.\n\nBut the movie belongs wholly and solely to Alessandro Morace. First movie and he lives the role of Tommi as no other kid could have ever done justly. He shows all the range of emotions so naturally as if this role was written keeping him in mind. He is magnificent. Equally good in their small roles are Marta Nobili and Barbora Babulova.\n\nIn the beginning 15 minutes of the movie Director / actor Kim sets the tone by exposing to audience scenes that would make the point  of what to expect from the movie so people are not deceived into any flamboyant commercial stuff.\n\nThis movie is jointly written by four writers with Kim being one of them.

Than the police arrives in the figure of the usual police duo: a small stupid, and the tall ice cold look detective. When the police left arrives the party, with all components of it: dancing men and women, most of them drunken, or in a deep depression. They find the dead grooms, but don't discover them. After the party comes to an end, the two robbers arrive. Than the detectives back.\n\nThe movie ends with a good outcome, you think. The dead bodies disappear and everybody goes home, police leave, ST as the robbers. But than comes the last twist the last joke not to forget the beginning.\n\nSo go to the video store and enjoy!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1461,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1998-04-22","keywords":"police,unintentional kill,accidental death,death,murder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488477/","name":"Michèle Laroque","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0862854/","name":"Elise Tielrooy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404485/","name":"James Huth"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043215/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078019/","name":"Romain Berthomieu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404485/","name":"James Huth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415038/","name":"Hugo Jacomet"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I read very good reviews of it and was interested to see it. Even if did not turn out to be what the reviews say (that happens quite often) I would had been fine.\n\nThe story is shown through the eyes of 11 year old boy Tommi (Alessandro Morace), who stays in an urban lower middle class dis-jointed family with his unemployed cameraman father Renato (Kim Rossi Stuart) and sister Viola (Marta Nobili). His mother Stefania (Barbora Bobulova) has left the family for some other man. Even in the dis-functional family where it is difficult to meet expenses and ends, Renato with all his frustrations, still loves the kids a lot. Parallel to this are two sub-plot running  one, where Renato wants his son Tommi to be a swimmer, whereas Tommi wants to become a football player. Second, the school life of Tommi  where he tries to seek friendship and love with his classmates. When Stefania suddenly appears one day out of no where back to the family  after a bit of test and trials  there is hope, happiness in the family. But again suddenly she disappears and leaves behind the traumatic family in despair.\n\nThis is the first time directorial debut of the very good looking famous Italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart. After his long acting career he does great justice to his new role as a Director. I read that he was not suppose to act in this movie, and only direct the movie; but just 15 days before the shooting  when the selected actor left the movie, the producers persuaded Kim to take the role of the father. Kim looks stunning, very pleasing to the eyes and has acted efficiently well. I think after a long time, I personally have seen some real good looks on screen. But I will leave it on girls and women to add more.\n\nBut the movie belongs wholly and solely to Alessandro Morace. First movie and he lives the role of Tommi as no other kid could have ever done justly. He shows all the range of emotions so naturally as if this role was written keeping him in mind. He is magnificent. Equally good in their small roles are Marta Nobili and Barbora Babulova.\n\nIn the beginning 15 minutes of the movie Director / actor Kim sets the tone by exposing to audience scenes that would make the point  of what to expect from the movie so people are not deceived into any flamboyant commercial stuff.\n\nThis movie is jointly written by four writers with Kim being one of them. There are so many numerous scenes in the movie that make you feel  oh alas, I hope I was part of this family and character. They are so wonderfully filmed. The touching moments moist your eyes and linger with you even after the movie is over.\n\nGood music, good editing, good cinematography! Great cinema! Well done. If I had not gone to see this  I would had missed a gem.\n\n(Stars 7.75 out of 10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2596,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-05-05","keywords":"angry,friendship,bathtub,boy rear nudity,bad temper","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3529751833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMxODQxZmQtYTNlOC00MmE0LTk4YTItNTU4MGQwYjQ3NDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMxODQxZmQtYTNlOC00MmE0LTk4YTItNTU4MGQwYjQ3NDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2291703/","name":"Alessandro Morace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744107/","name":"Kim Rossi Stuart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090469/","name":"Barbora Bobulova"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744107/","name":"Kim Rossi Stuart"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108293/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066197/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274769/","name":"Linda Ferri"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2289556/","name":"Francesco Giammusso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823425/","name":"Federico Starnone"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It actually has a point, unlike the other teenage films where all that they do is get drunk and party. American Graffiti is about different types of teenagers doing different things on the last night that they all have together in 1962 after graduating. They all actually learn about themselves and what they want to do with their lives. One of the older\n\nteenagers, Curt, is planning on leaving the next day. Steve is trying to work out his relationship with Curt's sister, while John and Terry have their own dates for the night. American Graffiti is a wonderful film on many levels.

A Most Violent Year is a strong, character-driven drama that's lifted infinitely by terrific lead performances by Oscar Isaacs and Jessica Chastain, inflating what could have been a tiresome, trite look at one man versus the world in an unkind city.\n\nAbel Morales (Isaac) runs Standard Oil, and he has his eyes on some prime waterfront real estate. With this land, he'll be able to fill his trucks from directly from the oil barges on the river, rather than have the oil transported from boat to someone else's trucks and then to his warehouses. And by saving money there, he'll be able to buy a little more oil than he normally would, keep it on the premises, and then sell it to customers or competitors when demand rises. He makes a deal for the land with a sizable down payment and the stipulation that the balance be tendered within 30 days - no extensions allowed. This, of course, is before Abel's company comes under investigation by an intrepid detective (David Oyelowo), his trucks get highjacked and the oil stolen, and his backers start to, well, back away.\n\nBut Abel is no wilting flower, whether he's dealing with the fuzz or the other oilmen in the city. He has his convictions, and damned if he's going to give them up to appease anyone. Which, as you might suspect, makes things a little more difficult. His wife Anna (Chastain), who can match Abel in sheer willpower, is also fiercely protective of her husband, her business (she's the bookkeeper), and her family. Sort of a two-pronged attack. Abel's charm and style nets him both friends and enemies, but this isn't yet another mobster movie by any means. In fact, the only direct evidence of organized crime in the movie centers around Abel's competition - men who would do anything to maintain and/or increase their share of the lucrative oil business in the city.\n\nBoth Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. Theirs is not a one-sided relationship. Abel is not some power-mad, bombastic husband who treats the wife and kids as either baggage or items to be used for fun and profit. Anna is not some melodramatic, over-spirited harpy who resents her husband's work obsession. They work together even when they disagree. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention an almost unrecognizable Albert Brooks, the company's astute and slightly amoral lawyer. Brooks, in what appears to be a Karl Malden wig, is a real treat.\n\nA Most Violent Year carries a strong message, and that message is this: don't count the little guy out, particularly when he (and his spouse) is whip-smart, unafraid to take chances, and endlessly resourceful. High praise indeed for director J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost) and his talented cast.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"new york city,american dream,oil,year 1981,immigrant","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi891727641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City 1981, an ambitious immigrant fights to protect his business and family during the most dangerous year in the city's history.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1567113/","name":"Jessica Chastain"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654648/","name":"David Oyelowo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1170855/","name":"J.C.

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location.

Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I hadn't seen it in about twenty years, but it affected me the same at 35 as it did when I saw it on cable at 14. It is one of the grittiest, rawest movies I have ever seen, and it works on a visceral level. The performances of Sean Penn and Esai Morales in this film go to show why they have both continued to be two of the hardest working actors in Hollywood. After seeing Penn as Jeff Spiccolli in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," I was amazed by his range in this film (although he was excellent in "Racing With the Moon," which if memory serves me right also came out around this time). Morales took what could have been a one-note role and turned it into a caricature of a revenge-bent punk, but his talent even back then was clear that he was up to the challenge of putting emotion into the role and bringing some sympathy to Paco's plight.

I hadn't seen it in about twenty years, but it affected me the same at 35 as it did when I saw it on cable at 14. It is one of the grittiest, rawest movies I have ever seen, and it works on a visceral level. The performances of Sean Penn and Esai Morales in this film go to show why they have both continued to be two of the hardest working actors in Hollywood. After seeing Penn as Jeff Spiccolli in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," I was amazed by his range in this film (although he was excellent in "Racing With the Moon," which if memory serves me right also came out around this time). Morales took what could have been a one-note role and turned it into a caricature of a revenge-bent punk, but his talent even back then was clear that he was up to the challenge of putting emotion into the role and bringing some sympathy to Paco's plight. Clancy Brown and Ally Sheedy were excellent in their roles as well.\n\nThe movie worked not just because the acting was great, but because the story moved along at an exciting pace.

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence, Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator, while Verger places a $3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.\n\nThe sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I absolutely love the plot for this movie.  It's sci-fi, it's action, and above all it's pretty original.  Jet Li is the best martial artist in the world.  The actual fight scenes in Kiss of the Dragon may have been better, due to the fact little to no CGI's were used, but The One is a much better movie overall.  What makes this movie work even more is the great selection of music.  How can it get better than seeing Jet Li kick the not out of people while Drowning Pool's "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor" is playing in the background?  Other artists in the movie include Disturbed, and Papa Roach so you can get a pretty good idea of what the fight scenes are like. This isn't a best picture, though I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for effects.

I absolutely love the plot for this movie.  It's sci-fi, it's action, and above all it's pretty original.  Jet Li is the best martial artist in the world.  The actual fight scenes in Kiss of the Dragon may have been better, due to the fact little to no CGI's were used, but The One is a much better movie overall.  What makes this movie work even more is the great selection of music.  How can it get better than seeing Jet Li kick the not out of people while Drowning Pool's "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor" is playing in the background?  Other artists in the movie include Disturbed, and Papa Roach so you can get a pretty good idea of what the fight scenes are like. This isn't a best picture, though I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for effects.  But in an overall enjoyment grade, I'd say this was one of my five favorite movies of 2001.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":90707,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-01-23","keywords":"criminal,convicted criminal,law enforcement officer,multiverse agent,running from police","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The One","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2876375833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiMmE5YWQtYmY0MS00M2YzLWIxNmYtODk1YjZhMTg5OWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiMmE5YWQtYmY0MS00M2YzLWIxNmYtODk1YjZhMTg5OWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001472/","name":"Jet Li","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001303/","name":"Carla Gugino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005148/","name":"Delroy Lindo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939128/","name":"James Wong"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001857/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0604688/","name":"Glen Morgan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939128/","name":"James Wong"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A Most Violent Year is a strong, character-driven drama that's lifted infinitely by terrific lead performances by Oscar Isaacs and Jessica Chastain, inflating what could have been a tiresome, trite look at one man versus the world in an unkind city.\n\nAbel Morales (Isaac) runs Standard Oil, and he has his eyes on some prime waterfront real estate. With this land, he'll be able to fill his trucks from directly from the oil barges on the river, rather than have the oil transported from boat to someone else's trucks and then to his warehouses. And by saving money there, he'll be able to buy a little more oil than he normally would, keep it on the premises, and then sell it to customers or competitors when demand rises. He makes a deal for the land with a sizable down payment and the stipulation that the balance be tendered within 30 days - no extensions allowed. This, of course, is before Abel's company comes under investigation by an intrepid detective (David Oyelowo), his trucks get highjacked and the oil stolen, and his backers start to, well, back away.\n\nBut Abel is no wilting flower, whether he's dealing with the fuzz or the other oilmen in the city. He has his convictions, and damned if he's going to give them up to appease anyone. Which, as you might suspect, makes things a little more difficult. His wife Anna (Chastain), who can match Abel in sheer willpower, is also fiercely protective of her husband, her business (she's the bookkeeper), and her family. Sort of a two-pronged attack. Abel's charm and style nets him both friends and enemies, but this isn't yet another mobster movie by any means. In fact, the only direct evidence of organized crime in the movie centers around Abel's competition - men who would do anything to maintain and/or increase their share of the lucrative oil business in the city.\n\nBoth Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. Theirs is not a one-sided relationship. Abel is not some power-mad, bombastic husband who treats the wife and kids as either baggage or items to be used for fun and profit. Anna is not some melodramatic, over-spirited harpy who resents her husband's work obsession. They work together even when they disagree. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention an almost unrecognizable Albert Brooks, the company's astute and slightly amoral lawyer. Brooks, in what appears to be a Karl Malden wig, is a real treat.\n\nA Most Violent Year carries a strong message, and that message is this: don't count the little guy out, particularly when he (and his spouse) is whip-smart, unafraid to take chances, and endlessly resourceful. High praise indeed for director J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost) and his talented cast.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"new york city,american dream,oil,year 1981,immigrant","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi891727641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTMxNTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4NTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City 1981, an ambitious immigrant fights to protect his business and family during the most dangerous year in the city's history.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1567113/","name":"Jessica Chastain"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654648/","name":"David Oyelowo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1170855/","name":"J.C.

I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song "Layla," put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.\n\nHedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1088861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1990-09-21","keywords":"gangster,mafia,organized crime,sadistic psychopath,rise and fall","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2673654553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWMyMjYwY2QtMDMxMC00ZmY3LTgwZGMtYzc3ZTgyZjQ4NDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWMyMjYwY2QtMDMxMC00ZmY3LTgwZGMtYzc3ZTgyZjQ4NDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000501/","name":"Ray Liotta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000217/","name":"Martin Scorsese"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683380/","name":"Nicholas Pileggi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000217/","name":"Martin Scorsese"}],"duration":"PT2H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song "Layla," put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.\n\nHedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1088861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1990-09-21","keywords":"gangster,mafia,organized crime,sadistic psychopath,rise and fall","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2673654553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWMyMjYwY2QtMDMxMC00ZmY3LTgwZGMtYzc3ZTgyZjQ4NDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWMyMjYwY2QtMDMxMC00ZmY3LTgwZGMtYzc3ZTgyZjQ4NDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000501/","name":"Ray Liotta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000217/","name":"Martin Scorsese"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683380/","name":"Nicholas Pileggi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000217/","name":"Martin Scorsese"],"duration":"PT2H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Posebno je uznemirujući podatak da apsolutno svi sa kojima Ejndžel razgovara završe mrtvi nekoliko dana kasnije.

This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft.

Four sleazy thugs, who could be spotted as bad guys by a blind man, hijack a Lexington Avenue subway and take passengers as hostages. A ransom-for-hostages negotiation begins via radio between the driver's compartment on the train and the central control center for the New York City subway system. The premise is hardly new territory, and, for those who have seen the Walter-Matthau-Robert-Shaw version of the John Godey novel, the film is even less original.\n\nHowever, for audiences that want a night out at the movies with a rousing action flick, "The Taking of Pelham 123" will fill the bill nicely. The editing is often frenetic, and the camera moves even during dialog-heavy scenes. The chases are fast paced, the car crashes are over the top, and the bloody scenes are properly bloody. While all of this is enough for some mindless entertainment, four excellent performances enhance the proceedings and make the film seem better than it is. John Travolta pulls out the stops as Ryder, the head hijacker, and, in his full wacko persona, steals his every scene. As the man on the other end of the phone, bespectacled Denzel Washington, dressed down in everyman frumpy, is quiet and assured, although nothing quite suggests that the character of Walter Garber will or could rise to his climactic actions. James Gandolfini plays the mayor with a sly sense of fun, and John Turturro is a hard-to-gauge hostage negotiator. "Pelham" is a man's movie, and the women are relegated to small, peripheral roles as wives, conductors, and hostages. How refreshing the film might have been if Scott had cast a female in one of the four main roles.\n\nHowever, whatever the movie's flaws, and there are many, "The Taking of Pelham 123" does what it sets out to do: entertain and engage the audience for two hours. Don't expect more, and you won't be disappointed, and, in a summer movie, "Pelham's" assets are exactly what most of us are looking for anyway.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":193092,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-06-10","keywords":"man wears eyeglasses,woman wears eyeglasses,train,hostage,subway","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Taking of Pelham 123: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1348535065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTQ4Mjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4MTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTQ4Mjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4MTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed men hijack a New York City subway train, holding the passengers hostage in return for a ransom, and turning an ordinary day's work for dispatcher Walter Garbe (Washington) into a face-off with the mastermind behind the crime (Travolta)."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350079/","name":"Luis Guzmán"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0323945/","name":"John Godey"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Pelham" is a man's movie, and the women are relegated to small, peripheral roles as wives, conductors, and hostages. How refreshing the film might have been if Scott had cast a female in one of the four main roles.\n\nHowever, whatever the movie's flaws, and there are many, "The Taking of Pelham 123" does what it sets out to do: entertain and engage the audience for two hours. Don't expect more, and you won't be disappointed, and, in a summer movie, "Pelham's" assets are exactly what most of us are looking for anyway.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":193092,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-06-10","keywords":"man wears eyeglasses,woman wears eyeglasses,train,hostage,subway","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Taking of Pelham 123: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1348535065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTQ4Mjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4MTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTQ4Mjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4MTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed men hijack a New York City subway train, holding the passengers hostage in return for a ransom, and turning an ordinary day's work for dispatcher Walter Garbe (Washington) into a face-off with the mastermind behind the crime (Travolta).","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350079/","name":"Luis Guzmán"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0323945/","name":"John Godey"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Tim detektiva iz 99. stanice u Bruklinu dobija novog kapetana Rejmonda Holta, veoma ozbiljnog i strogog komandantnog oficira, za razliku od ranijeg kapetana na koga su se svi u ovoj stanici navikli, i zato nastaje sukob detektiva Paralte i Rejmonda. Ejmi Santijago, vredna detektivka koja se uvek drži knjige, u početku ima kompetativni odnos sa Džejkom zbog brojnih uspeha sa obe strane, a kasnije njihova netrpljivost prerasta u romantičnu vezu. Takođe u ovoj stanici se nalaze detektiv Čarls Bojl, Džejkov najbolji drug, narednik Teri Džefords, veoma snažan i krupan ali osetljiv i porodičan čovek, Roza Dijaz, veoma agresivna i sposobna detektivka, asistentkinja Đina Lineti, veoma duhovit lik u seriji, i dva već starija detektiva koji su sada zaduženi za kancelarijski deo policijskog posla, Hičkok i Skali.</desc>

"The Good Doctor" je američka, medicinska, dramska serija u kojoj je glavni lik neobični, mladi hirurg Šon Marfi, autistični genije koji sve posmatra drugačije od ostalih i koji se iz rodnog Vajominga seli u San Hoze kako bi se zaposlio u prestižnoj bolnici Svetog Bonaventure. Uprkos tome što nema socijalne veštine i ne snalazi se u međuljudskim odnosima i nepoznati su mu pojmovi poput sreće i ljubavi, on je neverovatan stručnjak. Doktor Šon je izuzetno drag i inteligentan, ali ga šef ipak uzima na zub, zbog njegovog direktnosti i nespretnog ponašanja prema pacijentima, međutim, njegova genijlanost je neosporna.</desc>

Tim detektiva iz 99. stanice u Bruklinu dobija novog kapetana Rejmonda Holta, veoma ozbiljnog i strogog komandantnog oficira, za razliku od ranijeg kapetana na koga su se svi u ovoj stanici navikli, i zato nastaje sukob detektiva Paralte i Rejmonda. Ejmi Santijago, vredna detektivka koja se uvek drži knjige, u početku ima kompetativni odnos sa Džejkom zbog brojnih uspeha sa obe strane, a kasnije njihova netrpljivost prerasta u romantičnu vezu. Takođe u ovoj stanici se nalaze detektiv Čarls Bojl, Džejkov najbolji drug, narednik Teri Džefords, veoma snažan i krupan ali osetljiv i porodičan čovek, Roza Dijaz, veoma agresivna i sposobna detektivka, asistentkinja Đina Lineti, veoma duhovit lik u seriji, i dva već starija detektiva koji su sada zaduženi za kancelarijski deo policijskog posla, Hičkok i Skali.</desc>

"The Good Doctor" je američka, medicinska, dramska serija u kojoj je glavni lik neobični, mladi hirurg Šon Marfi, autistični genije koji sve posmatra drugačije od ostalih i koji se iz rodnog Vajominga seli u San Hoze kako bi se zaposlio u prestižnoj bolnici Svetog Bonaventure. Uprkos tome što nema socijalne veštine i ne snalazi se u međuljudskim odnosima i nepoznati su mu pojmovi poput sreće i ljubavi, on je neverovatan stručnjak. Doktor Šon je izuzetno drag i inteligentan, ali ga šef ipak uzima na zub, zbog njegovog direktnosti i nespretnog ponašanja prema pacijentima, međutim, njegova genijlanost je neosporna.</desc>

There are many hilarious moments that are only funny if you've been paying attention and understand where the character is coming from. There are also many tragic moments that would pass you by if you didn't know what came before. Many lines have double or even triple meanings. Watch this from the beginning, with a friend. Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.\n\nThe main Mad Man is the confident womanizer Don Draper, who is head of the Creative department at a mid-sized ad agency in 1960s Madison Avenue. I admit, at first I kind of hated him, but as the viewer learns more about him and his past, I learned to - not love him exactly - but like him and want to watch him endlessly. He is a complicated character who can be a very good man, but also a very bad man.\n\nDon Draper is joined by a rich cast of supporting characters, many of whom deserve a show of their own: The ambitious young Campbell who is utterly sleazy most of the time, but has occasional moments of growth and even cuteness.Peggy Olson starts out as Draper's secretary, but her growth into a strong, confident woman mirrors what is happening for Woman in the 60's. Silver fox Stirling - he may be morally bankrupt but gets some of the best lines. I could go on . . .\n\nThe 60's clothes, hairstyles, decor, and current events provide an interesting backdrop for what is essentially a character piece. The setting provides both the occasional laugh (cigarettes being advertised as "healthy") and the more than occasional cringe (how could dumping trash from a picnic in the park right on the grass ever seem okay?!).\n\nIf you need fast-paced action or a laugh track, this definitely isn't the show for you. But, if you like character development and subtlety in your television shows, rent the first seasons on DVD and settle in. You won't regret it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":224554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-07-19","keywords":"advertising,chain smoking,1960s,new york,drinking","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358316/","name":"Jon Hamm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440229/","name":"Vincent Kartheiser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019701/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1980806/","name":"Matthew Weiner"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi69710105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzNTI3ODk0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQyOTg5MDUx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a trailer for AMC's "Mad Men.""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

These aren't, after all, the big dramas or 'prestige' movies. The result is an endless barrage of derivative, uninteresting tripe, many of them remakes produced by the like of Michael Bay and directed by those attempting to get started in the industry. Why this is even more of a problem is because horror films and comedy films depend on one essential thing: timing. Those which fall in the category of 'suspense thrillers', those which don't really seek to scare as much as your average slasher, films like "The Last House on the Left", depend on atmosphere. They depend on the building of suspense and tension and dread, even when the outcome is insanely predictable. These films require a director who has talent with timing, with creating atmosphere, with building suspense, and most of the time, especially recently (sure, there have always been awful horror films, but there was a time when studios financed some respectable films at least), the directors who take on such projects seem either incapable or uninterested in doing all they can to make the film work.\n\n"The Last House on the Left" is a 're-imagining' of Wes Craven's accidental classic from 1972. That film displays Craven's potential, but while certain sequences are compelling it is cheap, clumsy, has a bizarrely chirpy bluegrass score, some awful acting (and some good acting), and the movie's biggest flaw: a Benny Hill-like slapstick subplot. Still, the movie worked. It worked precisely because Craven managed to create that atmosphere. That feel. The biggest fear I had going into this 're-imagining' is that the director Dennis Iliadis would turn out to be another Marcus Nispel, coming off his one previous film from 2004, "Hardcore", a film about prostitutes I had never heard about.\n\nI needn't have worried. The film is far from perfect, but Iliadis' direction is one of the film's strongest points. Along with the excellent photography the film creates a dark, foreboding, grimy atmosphere of horror, and wisely cuts out the original film's slapstick, and also fixes the score: replacing it with gorgeous, haunting compositions which occasionally give way to guitars, but thankfully not too often. Iliadis uses hand-held camera as well as anyone, not over-doing it at all, but filming everything with a stark sort of clarity, and he finds a surprisingly effective rhythm for the film which keeps it from ever being mundane. The director is one to watch out for in the horror and thriller genres. Perhaps his most impressive achievement in the film is the incredibly tasteful and brutally disturbing rape scene. The film, like the original, avoids the pornographic nature of many rape-revenge thrillers, such as "I Spit on Your Grave" or for a more recent example the 'unofficial' remake of "The Last House on the Left" from 2005: "Chaos", which was so gleefully vicious it became sickening, not effectively disturbing.\n\nMichael Phillips said it best: "The way director Iliadis shapes the key misery-inducing sequence, there's no hype or slickness or attempt to make the rape palatable or visually "dynamic." For that you have to go see Watchmen." The performances help. The only weak one is Riki Lindhome as Sadie, the murderous Krug's girlfriend. She takes her top off more than once for the movie's unneeded but inevitable nudity, but does little else. Garret Dillahunt is great as Krug and the rest of the cast good too, especially Monica Potter as Emma, the raped Mary's mother.\n\nI won't spoil the changes to the story for you but it does a lot to separate itself from the original. It's not a straight remake and the changes work. The film's ultimate triumph is its intimacy. Iliadis succeeds in putting you in Mary's place and in her parents' place. Not one who succumbs much to vengeful thinking, I was convinced by the film that I'd have done the same things were I in the place of Mary's father, John, played by Tony Goldwyn.\n\nThe film's major flaw is the very last scene, a nonsensical moment belonging more in a Stuart Gordon film than this one. Up to that point, in spite of some mediocre sequences, the film is a triumph of atmosphere and style, and is genuinely well-written. If you're looking for fun or an intellectually stimulating film look elsewhere. For a shockingly, shockingly good rape-revenge thriller look no further. This movie works. It doesn't only stand head and shoulders above every other recent horror remake (and certainly the ones out so far in 2009), but it is in a whole other league when compared to most of the genre films Hollywood forces down our throats."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":90194,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-10-28","keywords":"kidnapping,psychopath,escaped convict,escaped killer,microwave oven","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last House on the Left","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3927704345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgxN2UzYzktMWIwZC00NTJmLTg1NjktMDcyZGRhMDkxZDdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgxN2UzYzktMWIwZC00NTJmLTg1NjktMDcyZGRhMDkxZDdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip; Emma pretends to seduce Francis"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226813/","name":"Garret Dillahunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005321/","name":"Monica Potter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001282/","name":"Tony Goldwyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1531934/","name":"Dennis Iliadis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123433/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133024/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067362/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2085654/","name":"Adam Alleca"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0255296/","name":"Carl Ellsworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000127/","name":"Wes Craven"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was one of the most notorious movies of the early 70s but seems to be half forgotten now, despite being a groundbreaking horror film that opened up territory that had previously not been seen on screen. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' deserves some acknowledgement as being the most realistic horror movie up until that point (the late 60s), but even that had a supernatural element, something 'Last House On The Left' eschews. Craven took the contemporary setting and natural performances of NOTLD and added some graphic violence and a confrontational rape sequence, most likely inspired by Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' released the previous year, and made it into something quite unlike anything seen before. This made it the father of all subsequent serial killer dramas. 'Last House...' is still a very nasty and disturbing movie thirty years after it was originally released. Craven was a beginning as a film maker and the budget was minimal, so the movie is rough and crudely made at times, but the best sequences have an almost documentary feel which gives it an appearance of realism that makes it sometimes really difficult to watch. The acting in the movie is variable. Mari's parents and the comic relief cops (who include Martin Kove later to appear in 'Death Race 2000' and countless action movies!) are pretty awful, but the two girls (Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham) are both very natural and believable, and Craven REALLY lucked out with Krug and his gang who are all very, very good. Krug is played by David Hess, who also composed and sang the songs on the soundtrack, something which makes him pretty unique! Hess wrote Elvis' 'All Shook Up' and 'I Got Stung' and yet his performance as Krug is totally convincing. Krug is still one of the creepiest and most repellent killers ever seen on screen. Comedian Marc Sheffler gives an interesting performance as Krug's junkie son, Fred J. Lincoln (now a porno director I believe!) is excellent as the aptly named Weasel, and Jeramie Rain is surprisingly good as Sadie, who brings to mind some of Manson's girls. These four actors are outstanding and really help make the movie into an unforgettable experience. Their scenes in the woods with the girls are still as powerful and disturbing as ever. 'Last House On The Left' is hardly the kind of movie you "enjoy" but I think it's a very important movie, and still the best thing Wes Craven has been involved with. It's really quite difficult to believe that Craven made something so uncompromising and nasty as this! I highly recommend 'The Last House On The Left' to anybody interested in the development of horror, screen violence, or disturbing movies of any kind. But be warned, it is NOT easy viewing and may be difficult for many people to take. I think it is worth it as it's still an extraordinary piece of work!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36285,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1972-08-30","keywords":"rape,sadistic murderer,female victim,escaped criminal,sadistic violence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1816247833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNmNjY2MjktMzhhMi00ODM0LWJkYTctZTZiNDJmNmFkM2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNmNjY2MjktMzhhMi00ODM0LWJkYTctZTZiNDJmNmFkM2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two teenage girls heading to a rock concert for one's birthday try to score marijuana in the city, where they are kidnapped and brutalized by a gang of psychotic convicts."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144053/","name":"Sandra Peabody"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335715/","name":"Lucy Grantham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381450/","name":"David Hess"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000127/","name":"Wes Craven"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108859/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099633/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042922/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000127/","name":"Wes Craven"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410694/","name":"Ulla Isaksson"}],"duration":"PT1H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

These aren't, after all, the big dramas or 'prestige' movies. The result is an endless barrage of derivative, uninteresting tripe, many of them remakes produced by the like of Michael Bay and directed by those attempting to get started in the industry. Why this is even more of a problem is because horror films and comedy films depend on one essential thing: timing. Those which fall in the category of 'suspense thrillers', those which don't really seek to scare as much as your average slasher, films like "The Last House on the Left", depend on atmosphere. They depend on the building of suspense and tension and dread, even when the outcome is insanely predictable. These films require a director who has talent with timing, with creating atmosphere, with building suspense, and most of the time, especially recently (sure, there have always been awful horror films, but there was a time when studios financed some respectable films at least), the directors who take on such projects seem either incapable or uninterested in doing all they can to make the film work.\n\n"The Last House on the Left" is a 're-imagining' of Wes Craven's accidental classic from 1972. That film displays Craven's potential, but while certain sequences are compelling it is cheap, clumsy, has a bizarrely chirpy bluegrass score, some awful acting (and some good acting), and the movie's biggest flaw: a Benny Hill-like slapstick subplot. Still, the movie worked. It worked precisely because Craven managed to create that atmosphere. That feel. The biggest fear I had going into this 're-imagining' is that the director Dennis Iliadis would turn out to be another Marcus Nispel, coming off his one previous film from 2004, "Hardcore", a film about prostitutes I had never heard about.\n\nI needn't have worried. The film is far from perfect, but Iliadis' direction is one of the film's strongest points. Along with the excellent photography the film creates a dark, foreboding, grimy atmosphere of horror, and wisely cuts out the original film's slapstick, and also fixes the score: replacing it with gorgeous, haunting compositions which occasionally give way to guitars, but thankfully not too often. Iliadis uses hand-held camera as well as anyone, not over-doing it at all, but filming everything with a stark sort of clarity, and he finds a surprisingly effective rhythm for the film which keeps it from ever being mundane. The director is one to watch out for in the horror and thriller genres. Perhaps his most impressive achievement in the film is the incredibly tasteful and brutally disturbing rape scene. The film, like the original, avoids the pornographic nature of many rape-revenge thrillers, such as "I Spit on Your Grave" or for a more recent example the 'unofficial' remake of "The Last House on the Left" from 2005: "Chaos", which was so gleefully vicious it became sickening, not effectively disturbing.\n\nMichael Phillips said it best: "The way director Iliadis shapes the key misery-inducing sequence, there's no hype or slickness or attempt to make the rape palatable or visually "dynamic." For that you have to go see Watchmen." The performances help. The only weak one is Riki Lindhome as Sadie, the murderous Krug's girlfriend. She takes her top off more than once for the movie's unneeded but inevitable nudity, but does little else.

These aren't, after all, the big dramas or 'prestige' movies. The result is an endless barrage of derivative, uninteresting tripe, many of them remakes produced by the like of Michael Bay and directed by those attempting to get started in the industry. Why this is even more of a problem is because horror films and comedy films depend on one essential thing: timing. Those which fall in the category of 'suspense thrillers', those which don't really seek to scare as much as your average slasher, films like "The Last House on the Left", depend on atmosphere. They depend on the building of suspense and tension and dread, even when the outcome is insanely predictable. These films require a director who has talent with timing, with creating atmosphere, with building suspense, and most of the time, especially recently (sure, there have always been awful horror films, but there was a time when studios financed some respectable films at least), the directors who take on such projects seem either incapable or uninterested in doing all they can to make the film work.\n\n"The Last House on the Left" is a 're-imagining' of Wes Craven's accidental classic from 1972. That film displays Craven's potential, but while certain sequences are compelling it is cheap, clumsy, has a bizarrely chirpy bluegrass score, some awful acting (and some good acting), and the movie's biggest flaw: a Benny Hill-like slapstick subplot. Still, the movie worked. It worked precisely because Craven managed to create that atmosphere. That feel. The biggest fear I had going into this 're-imagining' is that the director Dennis Iliadis would turn out to be another Marcus Nispel, coming off his one previous film from 2004, "Hardcore", a film about prostitutes I had never heard about.\n\nI needn't have worried. The film is far from perfect, but Iliadis' direction is one of the film's strongest points. Along with the excellent photography the film creates a dark, foreboding, grimy atmosphere of horror, and wisely cuts out the original film's slapstick, and also fixes the score: replacing it with gorgeous, haunting compositions which occasionally give way to guitars, but thankfully not too often. Iliadis uses hand-held camera as well as anyone, not over-doing it at all, but filming everything with a stark sort of clarity, and he finds a surprisingly effective rhythm for the film which keeps it from ever being mundane. The director is one to watch out for in the horror and thriller genres. Perhaps his most impressive achievement in the film is the incredibly tasteful and brutally disturbing rape scene. The film, like the original, avoids the pornographic nature of many rape-revenge thrillers, such as "I Spit on Your Grave" or for a more recent example the 'unofficial' remake of "The Last House on the Left" from 2005: "Chaos", which was so gleefully vicious it became sickening, not effectively disturbing.\n\nMichael Phillips said it best: "The way director Iliadis shapes the key misery-inducing sequence, there's no hype or slickness or attempt to make the rape palatable or visually "dynamic." For that you have to go see Watchmen." The performances help. The only weak one is Riki Lindhome as Sadie, the murderous Krug's girlfriend. She takes her top off more than once for the movie's unneeded but inevitable nudity, but does little else. Garret Dillahunt is great as Krug and the rest of the cast good too, especially Monica Potter as Emma, the raped Mary's mother.\n\nI won't spoil the changes to the story for you but it does a lot to separate itself from the original. It's not a straight remake and the changes work. The film's ultimate triumph is its intimacy. Iliadis succeeds in putting you in Mary's place and in her parents' place. Not one who succumbs much to vengeful thinking, I was convinced by the film that I'd have done the same things were I in the place of Mary's father, John, played by Tony Goldwyn.\n\nThe film's major flaw is the very last scene, a nonsensical moment belonging more in a Stuart Gordon film than this one.

It was one of the most notorious movies of the early 70s but seems to be half forgotten now, despite being a groundbreaking horror film that opened up territory that had previously not been seen on screen. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' deserves some acknowledgement as being the most realistic horror movie up until that point (the late 60s), but even that had a supernatural element, something 'Last House On The Left' eschews. Craven took the contemporary setting and natural performances of NOTLD and added some graphic violence and a confrontational rape sequence, most likely inspired by Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' released the previous year, and made it into something quite unlike anything seen before. This made it the father of all subsequent serial killer dramas. 'Last House...' is still a very nasty and disturbing movie thirty years after it was originally released. Craven was a beginning as a film maker and the budget was minimal, so the movie is rough and crudely made at times, but the best sequences have an almost documentary feel which gives it an appearance of realism that makes it sometimes really difficult to watch. The acting in the movie is variable. Mari's parents and the comic relief cops (who include Martin Kove later to appear in 'Death Race 2000' and countless action movies!) are pretty awful, but the two girls (Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham) are both very natural and believable, and Craven REALLY lucked out with Krug and his gang who are all very, very good. Krug is played by David Hess, who also composed and sang the songs on the soundtrack, something which makes him pretty unique! Hess wrote Elvis' 'All Shook Up' and 'I Got Stung' and yet his performance as Krug is totally convincing. Krug is still one of the creepiest and most repellent killers ever seen on screen. Comedian Marc Sheffler gives an interesting performance as Krug's junkie son, Fred J. Lincoln (now a porno director I believe!) is excellent as the aptly named Weasel, and Jeramie Rain is surprisingly good as Sadie, who brings to mind some of Manson's girls. These four actors are outstanding and really help make the movie into an unforgettable experience. Their scenes in the woods with the girls are still as powerful and disturbing as ever. 'Last House On The Left' is hardly the kind of movie you "enjoy" but I think it's a very important movie, and still the best thing Wes Craven has been involved with. It's really quite difficult to believe that Craven made something so uncompromising and nasty as this! I highly recommend 'The Last House On The Left' to anybody interested in the development of horror, screen violence, or disturbing movies of any kind. But be warned, it is NOT easy viewing and may be difficult for many people to take.

Sure, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Pinhead, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger were all instrumental in my fascination and divulgence into the horror genre - but the possessed Good Guys doll by the name of Chucky was always my favorite of the tentpole franchises.\n\nIt is hard to fathom that it was 25 years ago when Chucky was first launched into our pop culture references with Child's Play. Directed to Tom Holland on a story by Don Mancini, the 1988 horror surprised most everyone with a $35 million box office gross against a paltry $9 million budget.\n\nSequels ensued with Child's Play 2 (1990), Child's Play 3 (1991), Bride of Chucky (1998) and Seed of Chucky (2004). Through each film, the horror seemed lessened by the increasing use of black humor scattered amongst the bloodshed.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the Child's Play franchise lost its way, but it did veer off the original path. This deviation was not lost of creator Don Mancini who takes charge behind the camera for Curse of Chucky now available on VOD.\n\nIn this sixth edition of the evil doll's murderous exploits, Chucky is shipped from a police evidence lockup to a home of a young woman, Nica, confined to a wheelchair since birth. Chucky's first victim alienates the young woman and when other family and friends arrive at the house to comfort Nica, it allows for a higher body count and a night of mayhem. Nica is able to put the pieces together to eventually figure the doll at the centre of the bloodshed, but her limited mobility will be both a benefit and a hindrance on her ultimate survival.\n\nWe've come a long way since 1988 and Mancini has more digital tricks up his sleeve to bring the doll to life. Some might balk at the idea of a CGI motioned doll, but take our word for it, the added computer detail only adds to Chucky's evil looks. There are a few scenes where our villain gets to show real emotion using his rubber face and it is the technology that a lot of horror enthusiasts despise that is at the root of the improvements.\n\nMancini did go back to the roots with the story that focuses more on the development of the horror rather than the slapstick funduggery that overly consumed Bride and Seed of Chucky. Replacing much of the pop culture referencing in-jokes are some tense moments of horror and some valued kills that value quality over quantity.\n\nCurse of Chucky goes places unexpected for a fifth sequel and it betters any of the films that preceded it in the series. Chucky is meaner, nastier and more patient which allows for better horror. There are some good scares in Curse and Chucky's evil might never have been better punctuated on screen. A solid story – one with flashback ties that support Chucky's choice of family terrorizing and some after the credit scenes that tie in the rest of the series – compliments the action and sets the stage for what we hope is the continuation of the franchise.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37917,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-24","keywords":"doll,wheelchair,serial killer,murder disguised as suicide,handicapped","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3028461849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3Njc5MTczMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIzOTI4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3Njc5MTczMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIzOTI4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Chucky the killer doll returns to terrorize a family funeral.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0703336/","name":"Chantal Quesnelle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1875040/","name":"Fiona Dourif"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2849998/","name":"Jordan Gavaris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238841/","name":"Don Mancini"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238841/","name":"Don Mancini"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Jamie Lee Curtis had a star making role in this movie and if you've never seen the film you should.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1978-10-27","keywords":"halloween,babysitting,year 1978,1970s,stabbed to death","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Halloween","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi330039577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTcxNGNjNDctZjYxNy00MWJjLTgzMGEtZGE5YTA3ZWEwYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTcxNGNjNDctZjYxNy00MWJjLTgzMGEtZGE5YTA3ZWEwYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Anchor Bay Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000587/","name":"Donald Pleasence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602985/","name":"Tony Moran"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000118/","name":"John Carpenter"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051701/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0756481/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017847/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000118/","name":"John Carpenter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384185/","name":"Debra Hill"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Part 2 was also an edge-of-seater.  But by the time you reach this, Part 5, the tension has gone from the series and Michael Myers has descended from a believable shadow-stalking figure into an unkillable Jason 'Friday the 13th' Voorhees clone.\n\nFor what its worth, the plot of this film involves Myers coming after Jamie, who is now in a childrens' psychiatric hospital after attacking her stepmother.  The concept of Jamie having a psychic bond with her deranged uncle is interesting, but it's all completely ruined by the constant unfunny attempts at humour, the tedious padding and the lack of likeable would-be victims.  Instead of genuine characters all we have here are Porky-style sex-mad teenagers with nothing approaching an IQ between them.  There's even a scene set in a barn similar to the one in some of the Friday the 13th films.  And Rachel from Part 4 seems to have been reduced to a stereotype blonde airhead whose only purpose in the film is to run around half-naked before being slaughtered. And why does Myers' mask look nothing like the one he wore in the previous films? \n\nOne good point in this film is Donald Pleasence, who is at his best as an overwhelming Dr Loomis who dominates his every scene and makes the film worth viewing.

Part 2 was also an edge-of-seater.  But by the time you reach this, Part 5, the tension has gone from the series and Michael Myers has descended from a believable shadow-stalking figure into an unkillable Jason 'Friday the 13th' Voorhees clone.\n\nFor what its worth, the plot of this film involves Myers coming after Jamie, who is now in a childrens' psychiatric hospital after attacking her stepmother.  The concept of Jamie having a psychic bond with her deranged uncle is interesting, but it's all completely ruined by the constant unfunny attempts at humour, the tedious padding and the lack of likeable would-be victims.  Instead of genuine characters all we have here are Porky-style sex-mad teenagers with nothing approaching an IQ between them.  There's even a scene set in a barn similar to the one in some of the Friday the 13th films.  And Rachel from Part 4 seems to have been reduced to a stereotype blonde airhead whose only purpose in the film is to run around half-naked before being slaughtered. And why does Myers' mask look nothing like the one he wore in the previous films? \n\nOne good point in this film is Donald Pleasence, who is at his best as an overwhelming Dr Loomis who dominates his every scene and makes the film worth viewing.  There is also an enigmatic Man in the Black Fedora-type figure who leads the film into the far superior Part 6.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-10-13","keywords":"halloween,fifth part,massacre,slasher,psychopath","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer, 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2057026073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000587/","name":"Donald Pleasence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364583/","name":"Danielle Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332081/","name":"Ellie Cornell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652860/","name":"Dominique Othenin-Girard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004014/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0352271/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0756490/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000118/","name":"John Carpenter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384185/","name":"Debra Hill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4302073/","name":"Michael Jacobs"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But undoubtedly the worst element of this movie is the script which could have been written by a couple of teenagers, the guards and cops have clichéd dialogue and the other actors have such a poor script to work with you almost begin to feel sorry for them.\n\nOverall this movie is very poor and most importantly not scary in the slightest.

First off, it has absolutely nothing to do with the Wrong Turn-series and second of all, it's being totally unoriginal!\n\nI wouldn't at all be surprised if this movie its script got pulled off from the shelve somewhere and got relabeled as "Wrong Turn 4" to cash in on it, even while it originally was written as a totally unrelated movie, to the the Wrong Turn-series. This movie really has absolutely nothing to do with any of the 3 previous movies, though it supposedly is still featuring the same cannibal family, consisting out of inbreds, who all look like Jake Busey by the way.\n\nBut the settings are all wrong. Really, a Wrong Turn movie should always be set inside of the forest I feel. But no, they thought an old abandoned asylum would be a far better setting for the movie this time. But why really? There are so many modern movies, that are just like this one, out there already, that use similar type of settings and also a similar concept. Thing they also all seem to have in common is that none of them are all that great. \n\nNo, this movie isn't ever really trying to be something new or original. It makes this a very redundant genre movie, that not even the lovers of it will be very pleased with. Sure, there is gore but nothing all that spectacular or surprising really.\n\nAs is this whole movie; nothing spectacular or surprising. It's a very typical and therefore also very predictable genre movie, that does absolutely nothing to attempt to become an above average one. It's just one of those movies in which a bunch of annoying, partying teenagers gets stuck at a place and are all getting killed one by one. It never has any tension or suspense to it because the movie obviously has no idea how to handle this.\n\nThe most positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's not the worst modern genre example I have seen but still, you are far better off skipping it.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2012-10-10","keywords":"lesbian sex,three finger character,west virginia,sex in bed,cowgirl sex position","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1884134681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkyNjc1YmItODVmOS00NjgxLTg1YzAtZjMwMDM4NjBmZjg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkyNjc1YmItODVmOS00NjgxLTg1YzAtZjMwMDM4NjBmZjg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser Trailer for Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1451329/","name":"Sean Skene"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2686585/","name":"Blane Cypurda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1819605/","name":"Dan Skene"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639508/","name":"Declan O'Brien"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639508/","name":"Declan O'Brien"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568416/","name":"Alan B.

There are so many modern movies, that are just like this one, out there already, that use similar type of settings and also a similar concept. Thing they also all seem to have in common is that none of them are all that great. \n\nNo, this movie isn't ever really trying to be something new or original. It makes this a very redundant genre movie, that not even the lovers of it will be very pleased with. Sure, there is gore but nothing all that spectacular or surprising really.\n\nAs is this whole movie; nothing spectacular or surprising. It's a very typical and therefore also very predictable genre movie, that does absolutely nothing to attempt to become an above average one. It's just one of those movies in which a bunch of annoying, partying teenagers gets stuck at a place and are all getting killed one by one. It never has any tension or suspense to it because the movie obviously has no idea how to handle this.\n\nThe most positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's not the worst modern genre example I have seen but still, you are far better off skipping it.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2012-10-10","keywords":"lesbian sex,three finger character,west virginia,sex in bed,cowgirl sex position","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1884134681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkyNjc1YmItODVmOS00NjgxLTg1YzAtZjMwMDM4NjBmZjg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkyNjc1YmItODVmOS00NjgxLTg1YzAtZjMwMDM4NjBmZjg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser Trailer for Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1451329/","name":"Sean Skene","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2686585/","name":"Blane Cypurda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1819605/","name":"Dan Skene"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639508/","name":"Declan O'Brien"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010224/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639508/","name":"Declan O'Brien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568416/","name":"Alan B.

I disagree because Teen Wolf has a special kind of suck going for it. Not so bad it's good but corny as hell and better for it. I've been watching this movie since it came out and I love it. How can you not love Teen Wolf? Michael J. Fox turns into a werewolf and becomes a popular star of his high school basketball team. There is even a dance at his prom that is wolf related. The whole school turns wolf crazy but Fox learns the right lesson in the end. How can you not love this corny crap. I'll be the first to admit that this isn't a good movie and is incredibly stupid, but honest to goodness crapfests don't have Stiles or a breakdancing wolf. Take that American Werewolf in London. Recently Teen Wolf has been blessed with DVD release along with it's sequel, Teen Wolf Too, on one disc. 80's fans rejoice!\n\nBottom Line: It isn't worthy of even trying to call itself good, but it's a classic, doesn't take itself seriously, and occupies a honored place on my shelf.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1985-08-23","keywords":"1980s,woman wrapped in a towel,werewolf family,teenage boy,coming of age","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teen Wolf","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi21937177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Y0ZTBhODMtNzA2ZC00MTlkLWIyM2QtZjhkOGU1NDM5MWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Y0ZTBhODMtNzA2ZC00MTlkLWIyM2QtZjhkOGU1NDM5MWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

Kept in a nursing home, days filled with vapid activities like shuffleboard or mah-jongg, whiling away hours floating in a deserted swimming pool, watching people your own age drop like flies. When that changes through the magic of alien technology, they become, if not the picture of reckless youth, at least a semblance of the people they were once upon a time, proving the old cliché: you ARE only as old as you feel. In that, it's a good lesson for people heading into their golden years or even those of us just having midlife crises. We can't help but grow old. But it's up to us whether we want to BE old or merely mature.\n\nFor a science fiction movie, it would appear to have few special effects. This is an illusion. There are quite a few effects shots, although the variety of effects is rather limited. The glowing aliens are quite good except for the all too familiar hand movements by Caprice Rothe, who first did the job for "E.T." Still, by and large the effects are impressive and convincing even when compared against the latest films of the 21st century. Even more impressive was the poolhouse, which was hastily constructed purely as a setpiece for the movie. It looks absolutely real, as if it had sat there among the Florida palms for decades.\n\nTahnee Welch, daughter of the seemingly ageless Raquel, was wholesomely fetching here. Whether she was a limited actress or merely underplaying the role is for others to decide. Ron Howard wisely kept Steve Guttenberg's role limited, focusing mainly on the older characters. A little Guttenberg goofiness goes a long way. Also present are the standard Howard family repertory, with brother Clint as the nursing home attendant and father Rance making a brief appearance as a detective. Much as already been said about the excellent performances of the older cast members. This was, after all, the role that finally won an Oscar for Don Ameche. But they're slowly slipping away from us, one by one. First Jack Gilford, then Ameche, then Jessica Tandy and recently Gwen Verdon. At least we'll have this movie to remember them by. Maybe they weren't at the peaks of their careers, but quite possibly the roles they fit most comfortably.\n\nTwo attempts to cash in on this movie failed. Both 1987's "*batteries Not Included," starring Tandy and Cronyn, and the 1988 sequel "Cocoon: The Return" flopped. Neither had the genuine warmth of this original. Ron Howard showed good judgement in turning down the chance to direct the sequel.\n\nAs for the musical score, it's one of James Horner's better works, mixing symphonic grandeur with childlike wonderment.

Kept in a nursing home, days filled with vapid activities like shuffleboard or mah-jongg, whiling away hours floating in a deserted swimming pool, watching people your own age drop like flies. When that changes through the magic of alien technology, they become, if not the picture of reckless youth, at least a semblance of the people they were once upon a time, proving the old cliché: you ARE only as old as you feel. In that, it's a good lesson for people heading into their golden years or even those of us just having midlife crises. We can't help but grow old. But it's up to us whether we want to BE old or merely mature.\n\nFor a science fiction movie, it would appear to have few special effects. This is an illusion. There are quite a few effects shots, although the variety of effects is rather limited. The glowing aliens are quite good except for the all too familiar hand movements by Caprice Rothe, who first did the job for "E.T." Still, by and large the effects are impressive and convincing even when compared against the latest films of the 21st century. Even more impressive was the poolhouse, which was hastily constructed purely as a setpiece for the movie. It looks absolutely real, as if it had sat there among the Florida palms for decades.\n\nTahnee Welch, daughter of the seemingly ageless Raquel, was wholesomely fetching here. Whether she was a limited actress or merely underplaying the role is for others to decide. Ron Howard wisely kept Steve Guttenberg's role limited, focusing mainly on the older characters. A little Guttenberg goofiness goes a long way. Also present are the standard Howard family repertory, with brother Clint as the nursing home attendant and father Rance making a brief appearance as a detective. Much as already been said about the excellent performances of the older cast members. This was, after all, the role that finally won an Oscar for Don Ameche. But they're slowly slipping away from us, one by one. First Jack Gilford, then Ameche, then Jessica Tandy and recently Gwen Verdon. At least we'll have this movie to remember them by. Maybe they weren't at the peaks of their careers, but quite possibly the roles they fit most comfortably.\n\nTwo attempts to cash in on this movie failed. Both 1987's "*batteries Not Included," starring Tandy and Cronyn, and the 1988 sequel "Cocoon: The Return" flopped. Neither had the genuine warmth of this original. Ron Howard showed good judgement in turning down the chance to direct the sequel.\n\nAs for the musical score, it's one of James Horner's better works, mixing symphonic grandeur with childlike wonderment. Alas, he does fall into old habits and reuse some bars and measures from his "Wolfen" and "Star Trek II" scores.\n\nIt's a shame this movie never found the audience it deserved.

It's incredibly strange and watchable...but also confusing and open to MANY interpretations. My advice is just watch it and see what you think.\n\nThe weirdness of this film doesn't surprise me that much since it stars Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor who seems to love taking chances with mind-bending and provoking scripts. Think about it...this actor hasn't just made one weird film but many...such as "Source Code", "Nightcrawler", "Brokeback Mountain", "Love and Other Drugs" as well as "Accidental Love"....all VERY unusual and difficult to categorize films. He certainly is a risk-taker....and I really appreciate that and seek out his films because of this.\n\nThe story is "Donnie Darko" is hard to describe....but I'll try. Donnie (Gyllehaal) is a disturbed high school student who apparently is in therapy after an incident involving arson. As the movie progresses, several things become obvious: he's brilliant, he can see the hypocrisy and bull around him, he's obsessed with time travel AND he's psychotic and dangerous. And, as the film progresses you see the world as he does...filled with all sorts of apparent delusions, including an imaginary friend dressed as a demonic rabbit, Frank. You KNOW all this will lead to something horrible...but what, you can't predict. What also is odd is that despite being highly disturbed, Donnie is, somehow, on to something...but what?!\n\nThe film is a mind-bending experience. I didn't love it, but I really respect it for trying to do something unique. I film you will probably either love or hate...I think it's worth your time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":771992,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2001-01-19","keywords":"surrealism,mental illness,cult film,cult classic,schizophrenic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Donnie Darko: 15th Anniversary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1835513369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhiOWQ2NTItOTMxMy00NTNlLWFhOWYtMjFiNzdjYjg4NjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhiOWQ2NTItOTMxMy00NTNlLWFhOWYtMjFiNzdjYjg4NjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Donnie Darko: 15th Anniversary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0540441/","name":"Jena Malone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446819/","name":"Richard Kelly"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008059/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148520/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064962/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446819/","name":"Richard Kelly"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">The Godfather: Part II: Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. With Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro. The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York City is portrayed, while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on the family crime syndicate." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0071562/","name":"The Godfather: Part II","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwMGQzZTItY2JlNC00OWZiLWIyMDctNDk2ZDQ2YjRjMWQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_.jpg","description":"The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York City is portrayed, while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on the family crime syndicate.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0071562/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"BrandtSponseller"},"dateCreated":"2005-05-10","inLanguage":"English","name":"Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under "sprawl"","reviewBody":"Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\nThe good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.\n\nDirector/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) "in the role" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the "inside" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended "flashback" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.\n\nThere's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call "J.K. Rowling Syndrome". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.\n\nThe film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.\n\nI've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.\n\nThe second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.\n\nAlthough the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1199431,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-12-18","keywords":"revenge,1950s,corrupt politician,cuban revolution,lake tahoe nevada","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Godfather: Part II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi696162841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Godfather: Part II"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701374/","name":"Mario Puzo"}],"duration":"PT3H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">The Godfather: Part II: Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. With Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro.

This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\nThe good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.\n\nDirector/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) "in the role" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the "inside" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended "flashback" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.\n\nThere's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call "J.K. Rowling Syndrome". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.\n\nThe film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.\n\nI've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.\n\nThe second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.\n\nAlthough the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1199431,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-12-18","keywords":"revenge,1950s,corrupt politician,cuban revolution,lake tahoe nevada","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Godfather: Part II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi696162841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Godfather: Part II"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701374/","name":"Mario Puzo"}],"duration":"PT3H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the "inside" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended "flashback" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.\n\nThere's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call "J.K. Rowling Syndrome". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.\n\nThe film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.\n\nI've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.\n\nThe second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.\n\nAlthough the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1199431,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-12-18","keywords":"revenge,1950s,corrupt politician,cuban revolution,lake tahoe nevada","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Godfather: Part II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi696162841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Godfather: Part II","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701374/","name":"Mario Puzo"],"duration":"PT3H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store, he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading, Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it.\n\nWhether you viewed in back in 1995 or now, where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely, this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying, it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections, squabbling ex-partners and so on  did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway, at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'.\n\nEven with this section, the flaws are rife  the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough, but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation  the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys (save the people) and bad guys (bomb the people). The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature  having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichéd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.\n\nEven the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.\n\nAnother reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semi-action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with, but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer, producer and (recently) a 2nd unit director  clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime.\n\nOverall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue, no real characters, no moral ambiguities, no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending  one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a pay-off that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it. Passable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood but it never even gets near the potential it had."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126351,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-03-10","keywords":"virus,epidemic,monkey,disease,quarantine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Outbreak","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi547029273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000623/","name":"Rene Russo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027715/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090684/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245435/","name":"Laurence Dworet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690798/","name":"Robert Roy Pool"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature  having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichéd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.\n\nEven the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.\n\nAnother reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semi-action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with, but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer, producer and (recently) a 2nd unit director  clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime.\n\nOverall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue, no real characters, no moral ambiguities, no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending  one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a pay-off that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it. Passable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood but it never even gets near the potential it had.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126351,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-03-10","keywords":"virus,epidemic,monkey,disease,quarantine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Outbreak","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi547029273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000623/","name":"Rene Russo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027715/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090684/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245435/","name":"Laurence Dworet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690798/","name":"Robert Roy Pool"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
