The producers make the same plot with the same result over and over again. There is only so many times that you can do that without the show getting boring.

The producers make the same plot with the same result over and over again. There is only so many times that you can do that without the show getting boring.

Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds.\n\nLike its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country.\n\nNow this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner.\n\nAnd if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience.\n\nIn closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85907,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But as a weekly viewing experience: it's lighthearted, fun, charming, entertaining and it works without having to try so hard.\n\nSome characters might annoy some viewers (the southern belle character is pushed to its limits, Rachel Bilson as dizzy surgeon who has to spend 1 year as a general doctor in the middle of nowhere might work as a dizzy new yorker but not totally convince as a surgeon), but I think that the overall charm of the show makes it easy to look past this and enjoy oneself.\n\nPeople should give this show a shot and see for themselves if they enjoy it or not.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But as a weekly viewing experience: it's lighthearted, fun, charming, entertaining and it works without having to try so hard.\n\nSome characters might annoy some viewers (the southern belle character is pushed to its limits, Rachel Bilson as dizzy surgeon who has to spend 1 year as a general doctor in the middle of nowhere might work as a dizzy new yorker but not totally convince as a surgeon), but I think that the overall charm of the show makes it easy to look past this and enjoy oneself.\n\nPeople should give this show a shot and see for themselves if they enjoy it or not.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":264995,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I never imagined that any show about the FBI could be so hateful against the United States.\n\nThe assistant Chief of the New York division, played by the lame Jeremy Sisto, spends his time trying to overturn convictions because he spent ten years in the FBI blacking out due to alcoholism, and sleeping with his subordinate, who covered for his mis-deeds. That is the new FBI.\n\nIn almost every episode, the FBI agents discuss the criminals, murderers, terrorists, etc., as being the victims of U. S. society, American values, white America, etc. Every story throws new shade on the FBI and/or the USA as a nation, or American culture.\n\nI have never seen any of the FBI agents say, "Wow that guy was just plain evil," unless it was a white Anglo who was (always) a racist, Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, etc. The message of this show is that white people are evil, and everyone else, including the criminals, are victims of "White America." I am not white, and I find this show incredibly disturbing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Certainly if you want to avoid a very loud and very angry fan backlash. Go back to the comics and give the fans what they want. In the case of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, that's not really the case.\n\nThere are a good few of us who really love those original Mirage comic books, but a larger group of Turtles fans want an adaptation of the vastly different cartoon series from the 1980s. They want characters like Krang and Bebop and Rocksteady. As illogical as it might sound, you have to make a faithful adaptation of an unfaithful adaptation. And that's exactly what director David Green and his Turtles team have done for this new movie sequel.\n\nFollowing the events of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continue to live in the shadows, bound to their underground lair by day, moving in the shadows at night, hiding from the very people of the city they risked their lives to save. Following the Turtles' failure to thwart a daring jailbreak, Shredder is on the loose again, this time with new allies. The Turtles must once again stop the villainous Shredder to protect the city, and the world, that don't know they exist from a new intergalactic threat.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows is a massive upgrade from the first film. There are so many improvements. The Turtles' appearances; sized down a bit and given a few cartoonish adjustments, they look so much better (Splinter, voiced by Tony Shalhoub, is also given just minor alterations but looks greatly improved). The film has more action sequences, and they're bigger and better. It has a better script. It has a better story. The score is better.\n\nThe Turtles get more screen time (a concern of expense in the first film; perhaps the budget has been upgraded too), which is a massive boost. Building on one of the successes of the first film, the character work here is great. These are good versions of the Turtles. Michelangelo, played by the brilliant Noel Fisher, is dead funny. Jeremy Howard got Donatello bang on in the first film and here, given more to do, he impresses again. Raphael is not only helped by some adjustments to his face, but he's given some comedy in this sequel and it warms you up to Alan Ritchson's gruff would-be action hero a treat.\n\nThe stand out Turtle performance, though, is Pete Ploszek's Leonardo. Pete just is Leo. This film does right by the Turtles. We get to spend time in the lair with them just being the Turtles. This is a lesson learned in the first film; when your characters are good, let us watch them. The Turtles each get character moments and proper, set up and paid off story arcs.\n\nStephen Amell's Casey Jones does a bit too much telling instead of showing (he tells us he's crazy but there aren't too many moments on screen to back up his claim, for example), but Amell's performance is likable, energetic and kind of wired; it works. Will Arnett wrings laughs out of every moment of screen time he's given as cowardly cameraman Vernon Fenwick and David Green's film wisely puts him to work. I know you're not supposed to praise Megan Fox on the internet but I like her April O'Neil. Fox is surrounded by large characters with big personalities yet her April never looks like she can't hold her own.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows is a good looking movie. Every set is stylish and filled with detail. It's colorful and full of cool vehicles and character designs. The bright colors and pristine look compliment to the cartoonish feel of the film and characters.\n\nA couple of the action sequences don't meet the standard set by the others. The film opens on a fairly disorienting one and a Casey Jones fight sequence doesn't seem to have been put together quite right. For the most part, though, the action set pieces are terrific. They're big, exciting and filled with character. The plane sequence in particular is very entertaining.\n\nThe obvious highlight, the stand out by a mile, better than everything else on screen, of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows is the bungling duo of Bebop and Rocksteady. They don't so much light up the screen as come crashing through it, high fiving each other and destroying the front few rows of seats in the cinema. \n\nThe pair steal every scene they're in thanks to an alignment of excellent writing, top notch CGI and pitch perfect casting. The chemistry between actors Gary Anthony Williams, who plays Bebop, and Stephen 'Sheamus' Farrelly, who plays Rocksteady, contributes massively to a wonderfully funny screen team.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86685,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In particular, I liked Daniel Mays as "Dave Shilling." Add some very tense robbery scenes, some sex early on, some double-crosses later and you have a very serious Keystone Cops type story where you're never quite sure what crazy thing is going to happen next.\n\nA fun two hours of diversion, supposedly based on a true-life account, but knowing filmmakers I suspect much of this is made up for dramatic purposes.

Yet this movie coasts on the charisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and witty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other or having sex, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for this seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play pretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this rom-com, "Friends with Benefits," Timberlake and Kunis play fresh, independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other.

Yet this movie coasts on the charisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and witty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other or having sex, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for this seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play pretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this rom-com, "Friends with Benefits," Timberlake and Kunis play fresh, independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other. So "Friends with Benefits" does not have much of a plot, but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two well-craft parts.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":346647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I get the feeling that he just can't win no matter what he does. He gets slammed for being in films and not using an appropriate accent. Need we look any further than 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'? When he does use an accurate accent, as he does in 'Thirteen Days,' he gets slammed for trying to elevate his game to a playing field dominated by more well liked method actors. I've heard an argument before that he should just stick to making westerns since, allegedly, they're the only films that he does well. Many would immediately argue that 'Wyatt Earp' cancels out 'Dances With Wolves.' I argue instead that people are just too hard on Kevin Costner and 'Thirteen Days' is a very good example of why he deserves a bit of a break.\n\n'Thirteen Days' was the fastest two and a half hours that I've sat through in a long time. The film was absolutely engrossing and very tense. Everyone knows what happens (or should be able to infer it since we'd all be dead right now if things hadn't worked out so well) but the writing and direction deserve great credit. They were able to transfer the tension from the historical situation and bring it to the screen with electricity. I think it works brilliantly well for two main reasons: 1. The viewer may know what is going to happen, but the characters don't. They are stressed, terrified and at the breaking point. One wrong move and the whole world is obliterated. If that isn't good drama, I don't know what is. 2. The film makers very wisely resisted the impulse to try and show things from the Soviet point of view. The strength of the film is the peril of the situation and the terror of not knowing what the other guy is trying to do. By filming from solely an American perspective and keeping both the characters and audience in the dark, this character driven movie excels.\n\nA second brilliant strategy employed by the film makers was in the casting. With the exception of Costner, there are no real stars. Instead there are more reliable, hard-working and chameleon-like character actors. Len Cariou, Dylan Baker, Stephen Culp, and Bruce Greenwood are just a small sampling. Greenwood plays JFK and excellently plays a man desperate for peace but surrounded by calls for swift military action. He sees the bigger picture where others don't, but may not be able to navigate the smaller picture without help. Dylan Baker is a doppelganger and his performance as McNamara is spot on.\n\nHighly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story unfolds as she proceeds to live her rather hectic, self-absorbed life interspersed with romance, a somewhat strained relationship with her father and sister, and the ever-present wonderment as to whether Jack the Prophet will be correct in his prophecy that Lanie will in fact die in a week. In other words, the movie does manage to keep you on the hook right up to the very end. (The ending was a bit lame, but still had a good message if you care to adjust yourself to it.)\n\nJolie's character, Lanie, is interesting, because if you watch the movie more than once, you will most likely start to be intrigued by her appearance: the platinum blonde hair, the puffy lips, the expressive eyes, the makeup.... you might start to think she resembles Marilyn Monroe, or, you may just write her off as a woman who actually looks a bit like an attractive transvestite(!). But no matter, because whether you like Angelina Jolie or not, you can't help but be a bit intrigued by the appearance of her character, which is kind of "out there" for Jolie. One potential problem, though, is that she is possibly TOO out there, to the point where she may distract the viewer from seeing the message of the movie\n\nTony Shaloub's character, Jack the Prophet, is very well portrayed by Mr. Shaloub. He's lovably wacko, and plus he has some pretty funny lines in spite of his plight in life. I like the Ed Burns character, Pete, because he reflects reality, whereas Jolie's character is kind of too unreal, but still fun to watch.\n\nI liked the setting of the movie, Seattle, since I live in Seattle. For those of us who live in the rainy city, it's fun to see an interesting movie that takes place in our environs. They also used actual news people from a local Seattle TV station, so it was kind of fun to see people whom I've been seeing on the local nightly news actually appear in a Hollywood movie. They changed their real names, though, which was kind of weird.\n\nThere were a few things I didn't like about the movie, the main one being that Lanie, who works as a modern-day TV reporter, comes across to me as just way too much of a sex-pot, I mean just way outside the realm of reality. It gets to be jarring after awhile to see such a sexy creature being passed off as a news reporter when we all KNOW that no modern local news station would put such a pouty, platinum-haired blonde on the air (....or WOULD they??? as Conan O'Brien would say.) But mainly I liked the movie, and it was actually worth a repeat viewing, as it kind of grows on you, and ultimately makes you THINK about your own life, your own values, your personal destiny, etc. BTW, there's a pretty good batch of songs that accompanied the movie too, though I don't believe there is an actual soundtrack available, so you will probably have to hunt down each song individually.\n\nAll in all an interesting movie, with a message worth pondering - if you can get past the steady distraction of the appearance of Angelina Jolie, of course.\n\nWell, that's my review. You guys have been a great audience, thanks for listening!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23564,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story unfolds as she proceeds to live her rather hectic, self-absorbed life interspersed with romance, a somewhat strained relationship with her father and sister, and the ever-present wonderment as to whether Jack the Prophet will be correct in his prophecy that Lanie will in fact die in a week. In other words, the movie does manage to keep you on the hook right up to the very end. (The ending was a bit lame, but still had a good message if you care to adjust yourself to it.)\n\nJolie's character, Lanie, is interesting, because if you watch the movie more than once, you will most likely start to be intrigued by her appearance: the platinum blonde hair, the puffy lips, the expressive eyes, the makeup.... you might start to think she resembles Marilyn Monroe, or, you may just write her off as a woman who actually looks a bit like an attractive transvestite(!). But no matter, because whether you like Angelina Jolie or not, you can't help but be a bit intrigued by the appearance of her character, which is kind of "out there" for Jolie. One potential problem, though, is that she is possibly TOO out there, to the point where she may distract the viewer from seeing the message of the movie\n\nTony Shaloub's character, Jack the Prophet, is very well portrayed by Mr. Shaloub. He's lovably wacko, and plus he has some pretty funny lines in spite of his plight in life. I like the Ed Burns character, Pete, because he reflects reality, whereas Jolie's character is kind of too unreal, but still fun to watch.\n\nI liked the setting of the movie, Seattle, since I live in Seattle. For those of us who live in the rainy city, it's fun to see an interesting movie that takes place in our environs. They also used actual news people from a local Seattle TV station, so it was kind of fun to see people whom I've been seeing on the local nightly news actually appear in a Hollywood movie. They changed their real names, though, which was kind of weird.\n\nThere were a few things I didn't like about the movie, the main one being that Lanie, who works as a modern-day TV reporter, comes across to me as just way too much of a sex-pot, I mean just way outside the realm of reality. It gets to be jarring after awhile to see such a sexy creature being passed off as a news reporter when we all KNOW that no modern local news station would put such a pouty, platinum-haired blonde on the air (....or WOULD they??? as Conan O'Brien would say.) But mainly I liked the movie, and it was actually worth a repeat viewing, as it kind of grows on you, and ultimately makes you THINK about your own life, your own values, your personal destiny, etc. BTW, there's a pretty good batch of songs that accompanied the movie too, though I don't believe there is an actual soundtrack available, so you will probably have to hunt down each song individually.\n\nAll in all an interesting movie, with a message worth pondering - if you can get past the steady distraction of the appearance of Angelina Jolie, of course.\n\nWell, that's my review. You guys have been a great audience, thanks for listening!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23564,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I admit that I have done so in a few cases myself (Thin Red Line).  However, in this case, I feel I must point out a few things.\n\nAll such films come with a disclaimer saying something to the effect that the characters portrayed aren't real and the story is just that, a story. For entertainment.  Martin and Tavington did not actually exist, they are merely characters, possibly based (as has been suggested) on actual historical figures.  I often wonder if such films as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or Rio Grande, or just about any western flick was judged so harshly when it came out as we judge 'historical' pictures today?  Or any pirate film?  Zorro?  Any film with knights in it?  It seems to me that unless you are making a documentary, the historical accuracy doesn't truly matter in detail.  Certainly, I enjoy films better when they seem to be a reasonably accurate portrayal of a time (costumes, technologies), but I don't carp about whether some person existed.  Even if they did, I expect the film to be untrue so I can be entertained. For example, most wars are not constant fighting.  Certainly some battles went on for days at a time, but there is a lot of waiting and a lot of marching.  Yet most war films seem to be battle after battle after battle, with no real respite except for the wounded.  Not so. How about some facts?    Fact:  Americans fought against themselves during the war.  Many Americans served with the British forces.    Fact:  There were in fact many atrocities committed by the British forces, rapes, property burning, etc.  Don't believe me?  Check out the history of what happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence, their families and their properties.  That's actual history, not just entertainment history.  Of course, this wasn't only limited to the British forces.  According to Massachusetts history, the Revolutionary forces (not necessarily the armed forces even) were, um, not kind to people who sympathized with the British.  The tavern recruitment scene suggests this quite well.  Were churches actually burned with a town's population inside.  Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly was dramatic, wasn't it? Fact:  Literacy was not as common at that time as it is today.  Many people, especially the lower classes, and slaves could not read.    \n\n Did Cornwallis have a pair of great danes that were 'captured' by the enemy? I doubt it, but possibly. Were slaves that served in either army freed after a certain term of service?  Again, I don't know.  (I am not even certain that slavery was allowed in Britain at the time.  Indentured servants, I think yes (though the difference is slight, I grant you), but actual slavery, hmm.  I'll have to check on that.)  The colonies typically did form their own militias for local use.  The americans did, as a general rule, fight using more guerilla tactics  (especially early on, the american forces were composed largely of more militia than regulars, see below for comments on militia), check the accounts of the battle of Concord, and what happened to the British forces as they withdrew.\n\nWar is brutal and ugly.  People die.  Many of the soldiers don't want to be there.  Militia, being less well trained and thus disciplined, does have a tendency to fight very poorly in set piece battles (check current and past arguments for keeping a 'standing' 'professional' army).\n\nIgnoring the historical accuracies or lack thereof (and btw, Braveheart was not 100% accurate either, though the main characters , Wallace, Robert the Bruce, King Edward, did all exist, but again, I don't seem to recall people complaining so loudly about that)  I found Mel's character to be believable and well portrayed.  Yes, there were elements of Hollywood happiness in the film (the beach town, he workers attitudes, the romances) and Hollywood sadness' in the film (the massacre, the child's death), but it was very entertaining.  I found many of the battles to be very realistic (okay, pistols WERE NOT that accurate and never have been) and sufficiently entertaining for my needs.\n\nOverall, a very good film.  Hollywood, certainly, but entertaining.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I admit that I have done so in a few cases myself (Thin Red Line).  However, in this case, I feel I must point out a few things.\n\nAll such films come with a disclaimer saying something to the effect that the characters portrayed aren't real and the story is just that, a story. For entertainment.  Martin and Tavington did not actually exist, they are merely characters, possibly based (as has been suggested) on actual historical figures.  I often wonder if such films as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or Rio Grande, or just about any western flick was judged so harshly when it came out as we judge 'historical' pictures today?  Or any pirate film?  Zorro?  Any film with knights in it?  It seems to me that unless you are making a documentary, the historical accuracy doesn't truly matter in detail.  Certainly, I enjoy films better when they seem to be a reasonably accurate portrayal of a time (costumes, technologies), but I don't carp about whether some person existed.  Even if they did, I expect the film to be untrue so I can be entertained. For example, most wars are not constant fighting.  Certainly some battles went on for days at a time, but there is a lot of waiting and a lot of marching.  Yet most war films seem to be battle after battle after battle, with no real respite except for the wounded.  Not so. How about some facts?    Fact:  Americans fought against themselves during the war.  Many Americans served with the British forces.    Fact:  There were in fact many atrocities committed by the British forces, rapes, property burning, etc.  Don't believe me?  Check out the history of what happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence, their families and their properties.  That's actual history, not just entertainment history.  Of course, this wasn't only limited to the British forces.  According to Massachusetts history, the Revolutionary forces (not necessarily the armed forces even) were, um, not kind to people who sympathized with the British.  The tavern recruitment scene suggests this quite well.  Were churches actually burned with a town's population inside.  Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly was dramatic, wasn't it? Fact:  Literacy was not as common at that time as it is today.  Many people, especially the lower classes, and slaves could not read.    \n\n Did Cornwallis have a pair of great danes that were 'captured' by the enemy? I doubt it, but possibly. Were slaves that served in either army freed after a certain term of service?  Again, I don't know.  (I am not even certain that slavery was allowed in Britain at the time.  Indentured servants, I think yes (though the difference is slight, I grant you), but actual slavery, hmm.  I'll have to check on that.)  The colonies typically did form their own militias for local use.  The americans did, as a general rule, fight using more guerilla tactics  (especially early on, the american forces were composed largely of more militia than regulars, see below for comments on militia), check the accounts of the battle of Concord, and what happened to the British forces as they withdrew.\n\nWar is brutal and ugly.  People die.  Many of the soldiers don't want to be there.  Militia, being less well trained and thus disciplined, does have a tendency to fight very poorly in set piece battles (check current and past arguments for keeping a 'standing' 'professional' army).\n\nIgnoring the historical accuracies or lack thereof (and btw, Braveheart was not 100% accurate either, though the main characters , Wallace, Robert the Bruce, King Edward, did all exist, but again, I don't seem to recall people complaining so loudly about that)  I found Mel's character to be believable and well portrayed.  Yes, there were elements of Hollywood happiness in the film (the beach town, he workers attitudes, the romances) and Hollywood sadness' in the film (the massacre, the child's death), but it was very entertaining.  I found many of the battles to be very realistic (okay, pistols WERE NOT that accurate and never have been) and sufficiently entertaining for my needs.\n\nOverall, a very good film.  Hollywood, certainly, but entertaining.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In short: great animation - go see it in 3D though - for kids and yes, parents will enjoy it as well.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Only in space. In the distant, distant future, a ship has been sent from the Earth carrying a lot of people, headed to the only Earth-like planet ever found. Sometime during the journey, things go awry. We pick up the story as an astronaut named Bower (Ben Foster) awakens from hypersleep, abruptly; he's soon followed by his commanding officer, Payton (Dennis Quaid). The rest of the crew is gone, and the only door is locked from the outside. What's happened here? Making matters more difficult is the amnesia that each man suffers from, owing to their having been in hypersleep way longer than intended. Somehow, they must piece together what has happened and find out what lies behind that door - and throughout the rest of the gigantic ship.\n\nNot only does the movie recall Aliens and 2001, you can also see similarities to The Descent and The Abyss; really, any movie in which people are trapped in claustrophobic environs. And although the pacing is frenetic at times, the movie is really chillingly shot (by Wedigo von Schultzendorff). On the one hand, the plot flows linearly - Bower needs to get to the ship's reactor so he can reboot it and save everyone - meaning that the actors race from scene to scene, running out of time. On the other hand, they don't piece together what's happened as quickly as they might in other, lesser films; they seem to figure things out gradually, as if assembling a puzzle in their heads. Bowers and others - and there are others - discover right away, though, that they're not really alone on the ship and that their enemies are extremely strong and fast and vicious.\n\nInjected into this oh-my-goodness-what's-out-there madness is, well, madness. The movie's title is explained as being a sort of mental illness that affects astronauts from time to time, when they just plain go bonkers for seemingly no reason and kill everyone on board. Is that's what's happening here? Is Bower the crazy one? Or is it Payton? Are they, in fact, alone on the ship? Foster is excellent as the hero who remembers a little bit more of their mission as time elapses; Quaid, in turn, shows a few more layers than we're accustomed to seeing from him (he's usually more of a poor man's Harrison Ford). Both actors turn in convincing, full-throated performances that complement, rather than succumb to, the special effects and cinematic wizardry. Often, the effects are the entire show. Now, it's true that you won't see a lot of character development here, as you might in the most cerebral of sci-fi, but what works best here is the paucity of knowledge about the situation and the characters. By spinning the tale gradually, feeding the audience only a snippet at a time, director Christian Alvart dangles the mystery in front of his viewers without allowing them to settle back and solve the mystery on their own. When you're constantly kept on your toes with sudden lurches of unseen shapes and reverberating noises, you - like the befuddled characters - are concurrently kept off balance. The result is an unsettling, entertaining delight.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145949,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie for me wasn't very thrilling. The twists are just devices that make no sense, and their explanations are weak.\n\nThe acting was OK not great, The British actors do better than Stone though.\n\nI did like the first one it was sexy and kept you wondering "Is she the Killer?"

There was this bright light, and a tunnel, and it was dark and all of a sudden, my mind was filled with knowledge that helped me figure out the art of making a big-budget hit Hollywood film sequel. Here are five commandments that can come in handy for you too, whenever you make your hit Hollywood movie and are confused about what to do in the sequel:\n\n1. Thou shalt not have any plot, whatsoever\n\nIt's sort of stupid, isn't it? Because if the studio had a script with a plot or a story of its own, why on earth would it waste it on a sequel? It would much rather make another movie out of it, which could have its own sequel with no plot! Actually, it's sort of genius, then!\n\nThis, of course, is painfully obvious in Taken 2, where the plot is exactly as elaborate as the movie's poster tagline: They want revenge. They chose the wrong guy. In the original, Taken, the daughter of a retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills (Neeson) is kidnapped by human traffickers and he has to use his "particular set of skills" to save her. In Taken 2, Mills and his wife are kidnapped by the same guys — because they want to kill him for killing their relatives in the first movie. The only thing thinner than this plot is the IQ of the mafia, which brings us to the next point.\n\n2. Thou shalt have stupid bad guys Of course, this is an obsolete argument, because if the bad guy was intelligent, the good guy would die and more than anything else, there would be no more sequels. So it's important for villains to do daft things like not kill the good guy after they capture him because they want him to feel pain (*cough*, The Dark Knight Rises, *cough*).\n\nBut here's the level of daftness of the bad guys in Taken 2. In a major turning point of the movie (it's even in the trailer), Mills' ex-wife is held on gunpoint and he's asked to give up his arms and be taken, or his ex-wife dies. Like a good estranged husband, Mills gives up his arms, but after making a minute-long phone call to his daughter in front of the bad guys, systematically explaining to her the situation he is in right now and what she needs to do to not get caught, as the understanding, well-intentioned bad guys wait for him to be done, because they probably have daughters too, you know. And after all, the most he could have been doing on the call was call reinforcements, right?  Wait, what?\n\n3. Thou shalt have foreign villains It has always made so much more sense to Hollywood to have villains who are not only menacing and evil, but talk in a language, that – HORROR OF HORRORS – they can't understand! So Hollywood villains are generally outsourced cheap labour from Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East and South America (never India, because Indians probably don't have the time to be evil since they are so busy in taking over US jobs and driving cabs). Also, it's just creepier when the good guy has no clue if the bad guys are plotting a nuclear strike or discussing Bigg Boss in front of him.\n\nTaken 2 takes this commandment and as a first, turns it uniquely over its head — in the movie, it's not just the good guy who can't understand the frightening foreign villains, apparently the hipster foreign villains can't understand him either (because learning English is so mainstream, yo). Or else why would the bad guys spend approximately 15 minutes of screen time looking for Mills' daughter — after he called her in front of them and told her to hide in the closet?\n\n4. Thou shalt have fiery dialogue exchanges  sort of Every mainstream Hollywood movie depends as much on its big-budget special effects and action as it does on its dialog . *chokes with laughter*. Sorry, I couldn't get through with that sentence with a straight face. Here's an example of the exact dialogue exchange the main bearded baddie has with Mills, after he has caught him and his wife, and is torturing them — with his accent, that is — rather than, you know, killing him:\n\nBad guy: I will kill you because you killed my sons Mills: But they kidnapped my daughter first! Bad guy: I don't care, they were my sons! Mills: But they sell young girls to Arabs!! Bad guy: BUT THEY WERE MY SONS. Mills: You know what, just kill me. Before your accent or logic do.\n\nOkay, maybe I paraphrased that last bit, just a little bit.\n\n5. Thou shalt substitute intelligence with action\n\nSo where do the studios put the money that could have bought them a decent plot, good dialogue writer, and locally-sourced American bad guys that could have helped the unemployment rate too? Answer: In LOTS of unapologetic, in-your-face action and kickass action. Taken 2 has a lot of those, and that's always, always a good thing.\n\nThere's also a sixth, secret commandment here, which really isn't that much of a secret, or much of a commandment, for that matter. No matter how badly you do, if the audience liked the first movie, it will watch the sequel and then wait for the threequel to buy the DVD box-set (guilty, as charged). And where Taken 2 is concerned, plot or no plot, watching Liam Neeson kick butt is always going to be worth it!\n\n\n* Nikhil Taneja (Firstpost.com) www.twitter.com/tanejamainhoon\n\n\nFor more reviews: http://www.firstpost.com/author/nikhil","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":293440,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No matter how badly you do, if the audience liked the first movie, it will watch the sequel and then wait for the threequel to buy the DVD box-set (guilty, as charged).

There was this bright light, and a tunnel, and it was dark and all of a sudden, my mind was filled with knowledge that helped me figure out the art of making a big-budget hit Hollywood film sequel. Here are five commandments that can come in handy for you too, whenever you make your hit Hollywood movie and are confused about what to do in the sequel:\n\n1. Thou shalt not have any plot, whatsoever\n\nIt's sort of stupid, isn't it? Because if the studio had a script with a plot or a story of its own, why on earth would it waste it on a sequel? It would much rather make another movie out of it, which could have its own sequel with no plot! Actually, it's sort of genius, then!\n\nThis, of course, is painfully obvious in Taken 2, where the plot is exactly as elaborate as the movie's poster tagline: They want revenge. They chose the wrong guy. In the original, Taken, the daughter of a retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills (Neeson) is kidnapped by human traffickers and he has to use his "particular set of skills" to save her. In Taken 2, Mills and his wife are kidnapped by the same guys — because they want to kill him for killing their relatives in the first movie. The only thing thinner than this plot is the IQ of the mafia, which brings us to the next point.\n\n2. Thou shalt have stupid bad guys Of course, this is an obsolete argument, because if the bad guy was intelligent, the good guy would die and more than anything else, there would be no more sequels. So it's important for villains to do daft things like not kill the good guy after they capture him because they want him to feel pain (*cough*, The Dark Knight Rises, *cough*).\n\nBut here's the level of daftness of the bad guys in Taken 2. In a major turning point of the movie (it's even in the trailer), Mills' ex-wife is held on gunpoint and he's asked to give up his arms and be taken, or his ex-wife dies. Like a good estranged husband, Mills gives up his arms, but after making a minute-long phone call to his daughter in front of the bad guys, systematically explaining to her the situation he is in right now and what she needs to do to not get caught, as the understanding, well-intentioned bad guys wait for him to be done, because they probably have daughters too, you know. And after all, the most he could have been doing on the call was call reinforcements, right?  Wait, what?\n\n3. Thou shalt have foreign villains It has always made so much more sense to Hollywood to have villains who are not only menacing and evil, but talk in a language, that – HORROR OF HORRORS – they can't understand! So Hollywood villains are generally outsourced cheap labour from Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East and South America (never India, because Indians probably don't have the time to be evil since they are so busy in taking over US jobs and driving cabs). Also, it's just creepier when the good guy has no clue if the bad guys are plotting a nuclear strike or discussing Bigg Boss in front of him.\n\nTaken 2 takes this commandment and as a first, turns it uniquely over its head — in the movie, it's not just the good guy who can't understand the frightening foreign villains, apparently the hipster foreign villains can't understand him either (because learning English is so mainstream, yo). Or else why would the bad guys spend approximately 15 minutes of screen time looking for Mills' daughter — after he called her in front of them and told her to hide in the closet?\n\n4. Thou shalt have fiery dialogue exchanges  sort of Every mainstream Hollywood movie depends as much on its big-budget special effects and action as it does on its dialog . *chokes with laughter*. Sorry, I couldn't get through with that sentence with a straight face. Here's an example of the exact dialogue exchange the main bearded baddie has with Mills, after he has caught him and his wife, and is torturing them — with his accent, that is — rather than, you know, killing him:\n\nBad guy: I will kill you because you killed my sons Mills: But they kidnapped my daughter first! Bad guy: I don't care, they were my sons! Mills: But they sell young girls to Arabs!! Bad guy: BUT THEY WERE MY SONS. Mills: You know what, just kill me. Before your accent or logic do.\n\nOkay, maybe I paraphrased that last bit, just a little bit.\n\n5. Thou shalt substitute intelligence with action\n\nSo where do the studios put the money that could have bought them a decent plot, good dialogue writer, and locally-sourced American bad guys that could have helped the unemployment rate too? Answer: In LOTS of unapologetic, in-your-face action and kickass action. Taken 2 has a lot of those, and that's always, always a good thing.\n\nThere's also a sixth, secret commandment here, which really isn't that much of a secret, or much of a commandment, for that matter.

You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. (* out of * * * *)","reviewBody":"The Whole Ten Yards (2004) is a comedy dead zone. You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. Every moment in this movie, begs for a single laugh, and it's as if the actors- -some who were all so promising in the original film, The Whole Nine Yards (2000)- -were promised big paychecks if they were able to tag along with the film's script.\n\nThe Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, who's now living in obscurity with his wife, Jill (Amanda Peet). Both are having problems in their marriage due to (a) Jimmy's erectile dysfunction, (b) Jill's inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition to become a contract killer and (c) Jimmy's transformation into a male-like Martha Sterwart.\n\nMeanwhile Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky's (Matthew Perry) finds that goons have kidnapped his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and that they are led by Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the father of the mob boss (also played by Pollak in the original), who was eliminated in the original film. Oz tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt.\n\nWarner Bros. has been unsuccessful in making mobster-comedy movie sequels. Analyze This (1999) was a funny film, but the idea to make a sequel was unnecessary. The sequel, Analyze That (2002), was an attempt to stretch an idea beyond its natural shelf life.\n\nBut you have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it was a good move to make a sequel to The Whole Nine Yards, or why Matthew Perry, who is playing Chandler (from "Friends") again, is unlikely to have a movie career, and why the film has been toned down to a PG-13 rating (the film cheats us of another view of Peet's breasts).\n\nScreenwriter George Gallo, on the DVD commentary, evidently has no regrets. "I think this movie is very funny," he insists, "I wrote 80 pages of genius." Apparently the scathing reviews and paltry box office have done little to humble him, as he adds, "It's like a homicidal Three Stooges." \n\nWhen Hollywood lackluster sequels are meant to be made, Howard Deutch is the man to call. He's responsible for Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II (1998) and Grumpier Old Men (1995). Deutch has also directed John Hughes-produced film such as The Great Outdoors (1988), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Some Kind of Wonderful (1987). \n\nIn The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes &amp; Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it.\n\nBut, if you don't laugh at that, there's Kevin Pollack (again) in one of the most singularly bad performances I have ever seen in a movie. It fails by calling attention to its awfulness. His accent, his voice, his clothes, his clownish makeup all conspire to create a character who brings the movie to a halt every time he appears on the screen.\n\nThere's also the propensity of a 107-year old woman able to pass gas. Surely by now, you must be rolling in the aisles? No? Then, I will mention that Bruce Willis' character is often unpleasant. He puts on an apron and a head cloth during the early scenes, as if such a disguise would do anything other than call attention to himself.\n\nDeutch, on the DVD commentary, is quietly apologetic as he points out all the things he wished he'd changed. "I was always sorry we didn't cut this out, " he says of one scene, "I think the joke is over." And I should mention that some of the film's elements such as the film's violence (for example, a scene where a woman gets a slap to the face) don't blend well with the film's light "comedy." And if you're planning on seeing or watching The Whole Ten Yards someday, let me tell you, it's not worth seeing for a whole ten bucks on the big screen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film has amazed me of the right balance, timing, touch, probability, possibility, and still continues to be a wonderful piece of storytelling at my 20th viewing. The premise is most simple, bordering on a soap opera plot. A gray-area guy wakes up against the corrupt and evil surrounding he used to be all right with. He gets to the bottom of his personal and professional life, and wants to crusade against all the wicked hands that feed him. The central theme here is anguish, which I do not know any worldly and sane person not to have. It is a story of greed, money, betrayal, violence, and self-doubts. A few secrets of this film's success, as far as performances go, I believe, are the followings: 1) the likable nature of George Clooney's character 2) the absolutely non-penetrative nature of the character of Tilda Swinton 3) the wonderful madness of the character of Tom Wilkinson 4) the cold-blooded charm of the character of Sydney Pollack. These four main players are with realism and acting internalization. The director Tony Gilroy must have been a great explainer to get all the characters understand inside-out of what they are, aren't, up to, and not up to, otherwise it would have led to shallower performances. I think it is rare to find a film enable us to understand and take a strange compassion towards the so-called "bad guys" (in this case, including one very bad girl). The reason is that everyone operates in fear and instability. No one is God and no one is Satan by design. "Michael Clayton" becomes the film's title because the bucks stop here. You can follow his final departure from the Grand Ball Room to the escalator and into a taxi, whose driver is instructed to "just drive for the $50's worth", and you can judge if Michael Clayton of the world can continue to be a shock absorber for them all, being Gods or Satans. My opinion is: it is a worthily meditative ending of a worthy film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film has amazed me of the right balance, timing, touch, probability, possibility, and still continues to be a wonderful piece of storytelling at my 20th viewing. The premise is most simple, bordering on a soap opera plot. A gray-area guy wakes up against the corrupt and evil surrounding he used to be all right with. He gets to the bottom of his personal and professional life, and wants to crusade against all the wicked hands that feed him. The central theme here is anguish, which I do not know any worldly and sane person not to have. It is a story of greed, money, betrayal, violence, and self-doubts. A few secrets of this film's success, as far as performances go, I believe, are the followings: 1) the likable nature of George Clooney's character 2) the absolutely non-penetrative nature of the character of Tilda Swinton 3) the wonderful madness of the character of Tom Wilkinson 4) the cold-blooded charm of the character of Sydney Pollack. These four main players are with realism and acting internalization. The director Tony Gilroy must have been a great explainer to get all the characters understand inside-out of what they are, aren't, up to, and not up to, otherwise it would have led to shallower performances. I think it is rare to find a film enable us to understand and take a strange compassion towards the so-called "bad guys" (in this case, including one very bad girl). The reason is that everyone operates in fear and instability. No one is God and no one is Satan by design. "Michael Clayton" becomes the film's title because the bucks stop here. You can follow his final departure from the Grand Ball Room to the escalator and into a taxi, whose driver is instructed to "just drive for the $50's worth", and you can judge if Michael Clayton of the world can continue to be a shock absorber for them all, being Gods or Satans. My opinion is: it is a worthily meditative ending of a worthy film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I asked my wife what her opinion of Assange was as a good or bad guy, and she seemed to indicate she was leaning towards bad. The last few minutes of the film, basically sunk that message in loud and clear.\n\nMy conclusion is, that, this film is a good example of the new way of being critical. Pretend to be fair and at the last minute, throw up a bunch of negative facts.\n\nI believe that combining the positive portrayal of the U.S. state department with the crazy portrayal of Assange, was neither fair nor accurate. History will probably judge this film as just another propaganda piece of the corrupt powers that be.\n\nIf I were to write this film, I think it would have been much more interesting to concentrate on the incidents of human rights abuses rather than on the Assange himself.

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.\n\nThe best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.\n\nIn general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although "Insidious" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow. What a rare (but not unusual) treat.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There is a very dark humor down below, but i enjoyed it very much in a first place because of very solid writing, pacing (at running time 1 h 43 min this movie never dragged) and not by "a numbers" movie. Good, underrated movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What a wild, surprising and funny time they have! I know the storyline doesn't sound very convincing, but, this movie is not 'okay' as most people put... it's the action movie of the year! The storyline is, as I said, probably not very convincing and that lots of movie have been made like that and you think that you've seen every on of them...\n\nBut if you watch this movie, you'll be really, really surprised. The director, Michael Bay, is one of my favorites and this movie is one of his action masterpieces.\n\nRating: 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I feel BETRAYED. \n\nThe trailer and lack of an all-star cast warned me that "The Crown and the Dragon" was probably going to be a low-budget film, so I was not surprised or disappointed by the poor quality of the acting or the mediocre cinematic aspects of the film. The effects actually somewhat exceeded my expectations, which are pretty relaxed and forgiving for low budget movies. However, a small budget is no excuse for terrible writing. The story made little sense and the dialogues and narration were heavy handed. The directing was also mediocre. \n\nThe Crown and the Dragon's greatest fail, however, was the quality of its characters. This movie touts a female director/co-writer and a plot synopsis that gives the impression of a progressive storyline with a strong, inspiring female protagonist (rare in the fantasy genre):\n\nofficial synopsis: " In a country cursed with a dragon, Elenn, an arrogant young noblewoman, accompanies her aunt on a mission to bring an ancient relic to the secret coronation of the rightful king of their people. When her aunt is murdered on the road by occupying enemy soldiers, Elenn hires a smuggler and criminal, Aedin, to escort her across the dangerous country so she can take her aunt's place at the coronation. But when Corvus, a rogue magister of the empire, employs a dark magic to retrieve the ancient relic for his own evil designs, Elenn must find the humility and strength within herself to fulfill her aunt's calling to free her people, and become a Paladin - the long foretold dragonslayer"\n\nElenn sounds like a hero, right? Wrong.\n\nWithout revealing too much, I will say that the "heroine" Elenn is far from an inspiring female figure. She's a damsel in distress trope who, despite supposedly being the protagonist of the film with purported powers, is reduced to a love interest/the object of men's affection... men who are the ones that ultimately drive the plot. The other few women of the film don't escape the filmmaker's internalized sexism, either. \n\nIn short, this film is a B movie that promises a breath of fresh air to the fantasy genre, but delivers little more than stale, hot wind. Thanks, Anne K. Black, for throwing women under the bus.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.9},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I feel BETRAYED. \n\nThe trailer and lack of an all-star cast warned me that "The Crown and the Dragon" was probably going to be a low-budget film, so I was not surprised or disappointed by the poor quality of the acting or the mediocre cinematic aspects of the film. The effects actually somewhat exceeded my expectations, which are pretty relaxed and forgiving for low budget movies. However, a small budget is no excuse for terrible writing. The story made little sense and the dialogues and narration were heavy handed. The directing was also mediocre. \n\nThe Crown and the Dragon's greatest fail, however, was the quality of its characters. This movie touts a female director/co-writer and a plot synopsis that gives the impression of a progressive storyline with a strong, inspiring female protagonist (rare in the fantasy genre):\n\nofficial synopsis: " In a country cursed with a dragon, Elenn, an arrogant young noblewoman, accompanies her aunt on a mission to bring an ancient relic to the secret coronation of the rightful king of their people. When her aunt is murdered on the road by occupying enemy soldiers, Elenn hires a smuggler and criminal, Aedin, to escort her across the dangerous country so she can take her aunt's place at the coronation. But when Corvus, a rogue magister of the empire, employs a dark magic to retrieve the ancient relic for his own evil designs, Elenn must find the humility and strength within herself to fulfill her aunt's calling to free her people, and become a Paladin - the long foretold dragonslayer"\n\nElenn sounds like a hero, right? Wrong.\n\nWithout revealing too much, I will say that the "heroine" Elenn is far from an inspiring female figure. She's a damsel in distress trope who, despite supposedly being the protagonist of the film with purported powers, is reduced to a love interest/the object of men's affection... men who are the ones that ultimately drive the plot. The other few women of the film don't escape the filmmaker's internalized sexism, either. \n\nIn short, this film is a B movie that promises a breath of fresh air to the fantasy genre, but delivers little more than stale, hot wind. Thanks, Anne K. Black, for throwing women under the bus.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.9,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this.

It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. \n\nOddly enough, the blood and gore in this film is kept to a minimum, probably to keep it at PG-13 in hopes of duping the largest possible audience to drop money on it. It would have really benefited from a Conan-esque level of violence to give the movie more weight and better directed action sequences. The dramatic pause in the middle of the action (made famous in the movie 300) is in every single action sequence. \n\nI really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it.

This is probably the only review I've done in the past 30 years and that's because I believe this was "UNFAIRLY REVIEWED BY CRITICS", so I'm hoping you'll give this movie a shot after reading what I have to say. \n\nI almost didn't go because the movie review in USA Today newspaper only gave it one star.

My wife is 70, retired and not a King fan (she hasn't read any of the Dark Tower books). Just to provide some additional perspective some of the movies we've seen so far this year and how we rated (in chronological order) The Founder 5, A Dog's Purpose 5, John Wick Chapter 2 5, Logan 6, Kong; Skull Island 7, Beauty and the Beast 7, Power Rangers 5, The Fate of the Furious 8, Guardians of the Galaxy 2nd Vol 8, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Wonder Woman 9, The Mummy 5, Spider Man 6, War for the Planet of the Apes 8, and The Dark Tower 8.\n\nI was worried standing in line to see the movie so when the previous show got out I started asking people (must have been close to 20) if the liked the show. (Would have asked more except my wife was feeling a little embarrassed.) Everyone said a hearty "Yes" except for one couple who shook their heads and said, "It wasn't like the books" and gave it a thumbs down. After that I was encouraged and looked forward to seeing the movie. I figured most of the critics were slamming it because it didn't follow the books closely. Frankly, from what I've seen, King books have always had a tough time being translated to the big screen. \n\nAlthough this movie didn't follow the books "right on" the main gist of the plot and characters were there so I wasn't disappointed. Contrary to what some other critical and user reviews have said, the plot was cohesive, well thought out, and had similarities to the book. The acting was very well done all around, the action was excellent and was not jittery or blurry.

The ONLY ding we could give this movie was that it wasn't done in a manner similar to "Lord of the Rings" where it's carried out over 3 films with greater detail and depth. That might have been better, but maybe not. Regardless, I wish critics would at least rate movies like this with 2 stars as long as they're fun, well done and entertaining. There's no way this was a one-star film.\n\nUnless you really need the movie to follow all the outline and plot of the books, I'm extremely confident you'll enjoy this movie.

Anyways, I don't even know where to begin so here goes: Plot/action: The usual cliché plot line that involves government agency coverups, bad blood, and conspiracies to kill the President. I thought the first 'XXX' was OK, but the plot of 'XXX2' is so unoriginal and narrow-minded it makes the first one seem like an epic. The action and stunts aren't even imaginative,.. seems like even money can't buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring,..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you're even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters: Ice Cube playing his usual badass self, although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to 'are we there yet?' that it almost seems like him and Vin Diesel (The Pacifier) have teamed up secretly to harm America with such bad movies. Overall, I think that Ice Cube's character lacks the edge of Vin Diesel in the first installment. The other characters in this movie including the main badguy (Willem Dafoe) are cardboard thin leading you to wonder as the movie goes along if the plot development will be just as bad.\n\nOverall Entertainment Value: 4/10,..I feel that the movie would have been better if they eased up on the whole government agency conspiracy aspect and focused more on stunts, which made the first one much more easy to watch","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68121,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Anyways, I don't even know where to begin so here goes: Plot/action: The usual cliché plot line that involves government agency coverups, bad blood, and conspiracies to kill the President. I thought the first 'XXX' was OK, but the plot of 'XXX2' is so unoriginal and narrow-minded it makes the first one seem like an epic. The action and stunts aren't even imaginative,.. seems like even money can't buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring,..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you're even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters: Ice Cube playing his usual badass self, although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to 'are we there yet?' that it almost seems like him and Vin Diesel (The Pacifier) have teamed up secretly to harm America with such bad movies. Overall, I think that Ice Cube's character lacks the edge of Vin Diesel in the first installment. The other characters in this movie including the main badguy (Willem Dafoe) are cardboard thin leading you to wonder as the movie goes along if the plot development will be just as bad.\n\nOverall Entertainment Value: 4/10,..I feel that the movie would have been better if they eased up on the whole government agency conspiracy aspect and focused more on stunts, which made the first one much more easy to watch","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68121,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare! Burnt shouldn't be compared with other similar culinary movies in the library and you might relish it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was somewhat intriguing, beautifully shot (in black and white), and the lead character was perfectly cast.

Childlike, yes.\n\nI didn't by any means hate this movie, but I did not love it as much as others. It is a film like no other, and worth a watch, but it left me feeling ambivalent. There was really no plot, which made sense because Frances didn't really seem to have any clearcut goals or ambitions (other than being a dancer, which wasn't ever going to happen). She lived moment by moment and the film took us on her journeys even though I am not sure they served much of a purpose.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was somewhat intriguing, beautifully shot (in black and white), and the lead character was perfectly cast. I love quirky characters in independent movies, but most of the time I couldn't decide if Frances was incredibly endearing or incredibly annoying. Immature, yes. Quirky, yes. Childlike, yes.\n\nI didn't by any means hate this movie, but I did not love it as much as others. It is a film like no other, and worth a watch, but it left me feeling ambivalent. There was really no plot, which made sense because Frances didn't really seem to have any clearcut goals or ambitions (other than being a dancer, which wasn't ever going to happen). She lived moment by moment and the film took us on her journeys even though I am not sure they served much of a purpose.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(from May Nashville preview)","reviewBody":"There's really only one thing you need to ask yourself before you see this movie: are you prepared to see Jim Carrey getting it on with Ewan MacGregor? If so, you should definitely go.\n\nThe movie tells the true story—and trust me, you'll have trouble believing it's true—of Steven Russell, a gay man who just can't stop conning his way through life. He uses his extraordinary abilities to gain a variety of jobs, gets indicted for embezzlement, and wins the love of the titular Phillip Morris while the two are fellow inmates in prison.\n\n"I Love You Phillip Morris" was written and directed by Glen Ficarra and John Requa, the same writing team responsible for "Bad Santa". Like "Bad Santa", this movie effectively balances humor and with some very dark themes, though I would say the overall tone is not nearly as bleak as that of the earlier movie.\n\nThe writers told the Nashville audience that when choosing material to include from Steve McVicker's nonfiction book, they decided they primarily wanted to tell the love story. They do so very successfully. You might even call this the perfect romantic comedy for people who hate traditional romantic comedies: it's homo- rather than hetero-oriented, it's non-fiction, and it features a somewhat off-kilter con man as the romantic lead. Sounds bizarre, sure, and yet all these elements come together to make a really entertaining movie.\n\nFor the most part Jim Carrey loses himself in the character of Steven Russell, delivering an effectively non-hammy (and non-Carrey) comic performance. MacGregor's Phillip Morris is also believably innocent, Southern, and wide-eyed. Nice supporting performances, such as Leslie Mann's as Russell's ex-wife Deb, round out the movie.\n\nMuch of the romance takes place in prison, and this creates many beautifully absurd scenes. The movie also has its fair share of sad moments, and contains a pretty clear message about social justice in Texas -- as did the book-- but this is kept mercifully subtle, underlying rather than overshadowing the story.\n\nThe directors said they hoped the movie would make spectators laugh, cry and think, and the Nashville audience seemed to do all three. There were a lot of laughs but some definite sniffles at the appropriate moments.

(from May Nashville preview)","reviewBody":"There's really only one thing you need to ask yourself before you see this movie: are you prepared to see Jim Carrey getting it on with Ewan MacGregor? If so, you should definitely go.\n\nThe movie tells the true story—and trust me, you'll have trouble believing it's true—of Steven Russell, a gay man who just can't stop conning his way through life. He uses his extraordinary abilities to gain a variety of jobs, gets indicted for embezzlement, and wins the love of the titular Phillip Morris while the two are fellow inmates in prison.\n\n"I Love You Phillip Morris" was written and directed by Glen Ficarra and John Requa, the same writing team responsible for "Bad Santa". Like "Bad Santa", this movie effectively balances humor and with some very dark themes, though I would say the overall tone is not nearly as bleak as that of the earlier movie.\n\nThe writers told the Nashville audience that when choosing material to include from Steve McVicker's nonfiction book, they decided they primarily wanted to tell the love story. They do so very successfully. You might even call this the perfect romantic comedy for people who hate traditional romantic comedies: it's homo- rather than hetero-oriented, it's non-fiction, and it features a somewhat off-kilter con man as the romantic lead. Sounds bizarre, sure, and yet all these elements come together to make a really entertaining movie.\n\nFor the most part Jim Carrey loses himself in the character of Steven Russell, delivering an effectively non-hammy (and non-Carrey) comic performance. MacGregor's Phillip Morris is also believably innocent, Southern, and wide-eyed. Nice supporting performances, such as Leslie Mann's as Russell's ex-wife Deb, round out the movie.\n\nMuch of the romance takes place in prison, and this creates many beautifully absurd scenes. The movie also has its fair share of sad moments, and contains a pretty clear message about social justice in Texas -- as did the book-- but this is kept mercifully subtle, underlying rather than overshadowing the story.\n\nThe directors said they hoped the movie would make spectators laugh, cry and think, and the Nashville audience seemed to do all three. There were a lot of laughs but some definite sniffles at the appropriate moments. At the Q&amp;A, there was a fair amount of interest in the real story, and Ficarra, McVicker, and Requa were happy to oblige with further information.\n\nCome to think of it, you may not have to worry about seeing the two leads have sex. Although the love scenes were kept technically PG, the directors were expecting a fight with the MPAA because of the homosexual content. That's a real pity, but I hope they win.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92670,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I first saw the American-language remake 'Assassin' back in the early nineties and have only just got round to watching the film it was based on, 'Nikita' (or 'La Femme Nikita' to be precise). Therefore, it's hard to accept that the French version is the original source material and not the remake. Both stay pretty much on the same story-telling path, telling the tale of a down-and-out, drug-addled young woman, killing a police officer in a burglary gone wrong, but eluding the death penalty in favour of working for a secret government agency to 'off' those who need disappearing. Yes, the plot is possibly a little far-fetched, but, if you can suspend your disbelief long enough, you'll find that it's well worth it.\n\nWhat you get is the story of a tortured soul who's trying to make a fresh start of her life and yet keeps finding herself dragged back into the covert ways of the spy agency to do their dirty work. You will definitely feel for the lead and the writing is pretty solid for her and all those she encounters. It's one of those rare films where there isn't a discernible 'baddie' to take on. The 'bad-guy' (if it can be considered so) is the situation she's found herself in and her attempts to - once again - change her life for the better and truly escape the shackles she's found herself in - whether a slave to drug abuse or the government's whims.\n\nI think the best thing about Nikita is its realism (yes, I know I've already said you have to suspend your disbelief to appreciate it, but hear me out...) - in many modern films where the lead is a female action hero who spends her time beating up dozens of burly men who stand in her way, you feel that - although cool to look at - it may not happen that way in real life. However, in Nikita she never uses her physical strength to overpower and take-down her targets. Instead, she uses her wits and deadeye with a sniper's rifle to get the dirty job done (and get home in time for tea with her new fella).\n\nI'm glad I've watched the original. It's a decent film which blends action with genuine emotion for the characters, plus it's worth noting that it was good enough to inspire whoever greenlit its American remake NOT to change it so much that it's barely recognisable and remained true to what made it great in the first place.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68684,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I first saw the American-language remake 'Assassin' back in the early nineties and have only just got round to watching the film it was based on, 'Nikita' (or 'La Femme Nikita' to be precise). Therefore, it's hard to accept that the French version is the original source material and not the remake. Both stay pretty much on the same story-telling path, telling the tale of a down-and-out, drug-addled young woman, killing a police officer in a burglary gone wrong, but eluding the death penalty in favour of working for a secret government agency to 'off' those who need disappearing. Yes, the plot is possibly a little far-fetched, but, if you can suspend your disbelief long enough, you'll find that it's well worth it.\n\nWhat you get is the story of a tortured soul who's trying to make a fresh start of her life and yet keeps finding herself dragged back into the covert ways of the spy agency to do their dirty work. You will definitely feel for the lead and the writing is pretty solid for her and all those she encounters. It's one of those rare films where there isn't a discernible 'baddie' to take on. The 'bad-guy' (if it can be considered so) is the situation she's found herself in and her attempts to - once again - change her life for the better and truly escape the shackles she's found herself in - whether a slave to drug abuse or the government's whims.\n\nI think the best thing about Nikita is its realism (yes, I know I've already said you have to suspend your disbelief to appreciate it, but hear me out...) - in many modern films where the lead is a female action hero who spends her time beating up dozens of burly men who stand in her way, you feel that - although cool to look at - it may not happen that way in real life. However, in Nikita she never uses her physical strength to overpower and take-down her targets. Instead, she uses her wits and deadeye with a sniper's rifle to get the dirty job done (and get home in time for tea with her new fella).\n\nI'm glad I've watched the original. It's a decent film which blends action with genuine emotion for the characters, plus it's worth noting that it was good enough to inspire whoever greenlit its American remake NOT to change it so much that it's barely recognisable and remained true to what made it great in the first place.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68684,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the equivalent of advertising the whole of Disneyland with just clips of Space Mountain again and again. There's a lot more going on here than Ryan Gosling robbing banks and being a general badass in The Place Beyond The Pines. There are in fact at least three main characters all with their own story. And while the Ryan Gosling section is, a bit like Space Mountain at Disney, the best bit of the package he is only one part of a much bigger picture. \n\nA motor bike stunt rider finds out he has a son so packs in his day job and takes the logical step of robbing banks to provide for him. The story deals with the family life of the man as well as a rookie cop who exposes his police department to be corrupt. \n\nI found the film very absorbing from the start with Ryan Gosling's character development on fast forward so at least 3 massive life events all happen in the first 20 minutes of the film. There's not a lot of action scenes but when there are they're very tense and exciting. \n\nThe family life aspect is quite heartwarming and you do believe that his character does love his son and wants to provide for him. There are fantastic believable acting performances all round here with Ryan Gosling and later on Bradley Cooper really showcasing their acting talents. It's engaging and I really cared what happened to both of their characters. \n\nThe main problem with the film is it's length and not knowing when to stop. The first part of the film is constantly engaging and would be a nine out of ten if the film stayed like that the whole way through. When the focus shifts from characters however it really doesn't feel as exciting and almost feels like the start of totally different movie. A movie that isn't bad but is nowhere near as good as the one you've just seen.\n\nEvery story told is linked obviously but sometimes it feels a tad loose. There is a dramatic time shift when the film reaches the 100 minute mark and what follows really seems to drag. It never really felt like it was going anywhere. It was by no means boring however, it just lost a bit of steam towards the end. The Place Beyond The Pines is worth a watch but just be prepared to have you're socks blown off and then have them planted firmly back on your feet as the film continues.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252565,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's the equivalent of advertising the whole of Disneyland with just clips of Space Mountain again and again. There's a lot more going on here than Ryan Gosling robbing banks and being a general badass in The Place Beyond The Pines. There are in fact at least three main characters all with their own story. And while the Ryan Gosling section is, a bit like Space Mountain at Disney, the best bit of the package he is only one part of a much bigger picture. \n\nA motor bike stunt rider finds out he has a son so packs in his day job and takes the logical step of robbing banks to provide for him. The story deals with the family life of the man as well as a rookie cop who exposes his police department to be corrupt. \n\nI found the film very absorbing from the start with Ryan Gosling's character development on fast forward so at least 3 massive life events all happen in the first 20 minutes of the film. There's not a lot of action scenes but when there are they're very tense and exciting. \n\nThe family life aspect is quite heartwarming and you do believe that his character does love his son and wants to provide for him. There are fantastic believable acting performances all round here with Ryan Gosling and later on Bradley Cooper really showcasing their acting talents. It's engaging and I really cared what happened to both of their characters. \n\nThe main problem with the film is it's length and not knowing when to stop. The first part of the film is constantly engaging and would be a nine out of ten if the film stayed like that the whole way through. When the focus shifts from characters however it really doesn't feel as exciting and almost feels like the start of totally different movie. A movie that isn't bad but is nowhere near as good as the one you've just seen.\n\nEvery story told is linked obviously but sometimes it feels a tad loose. There is a dramatic time shift when the film reaches the 100 minute mark and what follows really seems to drag. It never really felt like it was going anywhere. It was by no means boring however, it just lost a bit of steam towards the end. The Place Beyond The Pines is worth a watch but just be prepared to have you're socks blown off and then have them planted firmly back on your feet as the film continues.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252565,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First and foremost, this is Oscars season and this type of film is just what one expects to come out and be showered with Oscar buzz – and quite often these films are found to be lacking once they are out of this period and on their own. The second reason was related and it was that I didn't for a second think that this film would be able to go for more than two minutes without the heroic music coming up, a soft focus being slapped on the lens and someone giving a great speech about the morality of everything while the camera cuts to those around looking teary eyed and yet full of admiration. In other words I worried that this would simply be a more expensive version of The West Wing season 1.\n\nAlthough the film does rather fall into these traps occasionally, it is by no means seriously flawed since the majority of the film is patience and very well delivered. We focus on the final few years of Lincoln's life, specifically the period towards the end of the war where slavery was abolished by Constitutional amendment. As such the film is about political wrangling and the determination to stay the course with the goal even though it would be difficult and smart politics suggested to not risk the bigger prize (peace) at the expense of an aspiration. The film shows this very well and it manages to be patient without being slow – which is quite the achievement considering that the film is essentially men in rooms talking. The politicking was well delivered so that it wasn't dull but wasn't falsely sped up. The sentimentality is kept to a surprisingly low. It is still there of course and the camera frequently looks for a heroic frame and the music often reminds us the grandeur of what we are seeing, but it doesn't overdo it too much and certainly nowhere near the levels I feared.\n\nDay Lewis is perhaps a given for the Oscar. His Lincoln is certainly a spot on creation – he comes over as heroic and steadfast without being mythicalised by his own performance. He really gives an impression of the man's spirit throughout the film. The supporting cast is so deep in names and faces that it is hard to know where to start; being honest, at times I did find it a little distracting as a parade came across the screen – seemingly all from TV shows I watch or films I had seen, I suspect I could be quite far down the cast list before I found someone I couldn't place. Aside from this distracting a little, it does mean the cast is deep in talent and everyone does well. Tommy Lee Jones in particular adds passion and color to all his scenes and the film benefits from his performance. Field is perhaps not as good – although in fairness I didn't think the personal side to the story worked as well as the rest – and since this is her parts, maybe that is why I didn't like her performance as much. Spielberg's direction is very well paced; shots are very well picked and the camera is very patient in its movement.\n\nLincoln didn't blow me away but it did quietly impress me. Part of the reason for this is that the film doesn't go all out for emotion or history or sentimentality, it simply lets it happen in the main and manages to keep these traps to a comparative minimum that really helps the film. It is long but never boring, respectful but never overly so."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249754,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In his "alias" will Bob steal the trainrobber's girl to boot?  Western fans might want to watch the Paleface, or Son of Paleface, before judging Hope on this one though.

It is funny, but it's not as quick as the "Road" movies.  Hope plays a life insurance salesman in the old west, who sells a huge policy to Jesse James! Bob is then sent to protect his policy holder and his job.  In order to keep jesse safe, Hope risks life and limb by acting and dressing as the real gunslinger would.  In his "alias" will Bob steal the trainrobber's girl to boot?  Western fans might want to watch the Paleface, or Son of Paleface, before judging Hope on this one though. Basically the same movie made three times. "Alias" does have some cameo appearances from early television and movies i think western fans will find fun. Worth a watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That may be a little too strong, but the results are definitely sub-par for the legendary filmmaker. If The Searchers (1956) dealt with whites kidnapped by Indians, the plot here is a reversal: Whites raised as Comanches are ransomed back into the white world, and in the process of reintegration, settler bigotry is exposed. That's a good thoughtful premise but the screenplay can't seem to provide a focus on anything. As a result, the story meanders from event to event in generally unfocused fashion. For whatever reason, writer Nugent can't seem to organize the elements into a coherent, effective narrative.\n\nThen there's the miscasting, especially Widmark as a 45-year old West Point lieutenant, who's supposed to romance a 26-year old Shirley Jones, who looks and acts like she just stepped out of a malt shop. And shouldn't forget poor 55-year old Andy Devine, a very un-cavalrylike cavalry sergeant. Somehow, his grossly over-weight figure is just not that funny. On the other hand, Stewart's not miscast, but this may be the only movie where his usual low-key style gives way to some serious over-acting, which unfortunately overshadows his low-key co-star Widmark. His character is, however, surprisingly dark and combative, an interesting feature.\n\nAt the same time, for a western, there's little action, mostly just palaver and clumsy stabs at humor. However, the lynching scene is well staged and a real grabber. Anyway, it's pretty clear that director Ford's heart wasn't really in the production for whatever reason. Unfortunately, the end result is one of the least of his many fine Westerns."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5679,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That may be a little too strong, but the results are definitely sub-par for the legendary filmmaker. If The Searchers (1956) dealt with whites kidnapped by Indians, the plot here is a reversal: Whites raised as Comanches are ransomed back into the white world, and in the process of reintegration, settler bigotry is exposed. That's a good thoughtful premise but the screenplay can't seem to provide a focus on anything. As a result, the story meanders from event to event in generally unfocused fashion. For whatever reason, writer Nugent can't seem to organize the elements into a coherent, effective narrative.\n\nThen there's the miscasting, especially Widmark as a 45-year old West Point lieutenant, who's supposed to romance a 26-year old Shirley Jones, who looks and acts like she just stepped out of a malt shop. And shouldn't forget poor 55-year old Andy Devine, a very un-cavalrylike cavalry sergeant. Somehow, his grossly over-weight figure is just not that funny. On the other hand, Stewart's not miscast, but this may be the only movie where his usual low-key style gives way to some serious over-acting, which unfortunately overshadows his low-key co-star Widmark. His character is, however, surprisingly dark and combative, an interesting feature.\n\nAt the same time, for a western, there's little action, mostly just palaver and clumsy stabs at humor. However, the lynching scene is well staged and a real grabber. Anyway, it's pretty clear that director Ford's heart wasn't really in the production for whatever reason. Unfortunately, the end result is one of the least of his many fine Westerns.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5679,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I don't think I'll see another that is so entertaining.\n\nYou don't need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie. It just has to keep you captivated, not shell-shocked.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122017,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The premise alone sounds amazing, the way its set up, how the characters are introduced, the action sequences, and the special effects are simply good. The film has elements of a superhero movie but is - more so than actual superhero movies these days - grounded in reality. There are very few futuristic looking gadgets, the locations and the weapons are all realistic, making the Jumpers feel like a secret part of society that could actually exist.\n\nThe characters in Jumpers seem like regular people. Millie (Rachel Bilson) acts and reacts like a normal girl whose not a comic book fan or someone who doesn't entertain the idea that teleportation is possibility. Griffin (Jamie Bell) is a bit a dick and David Rice (Hayden Christensen) doesn't even seem to realize what's happening to him, he lives in his bubble and doing his own thing - like most people would in his case.\n\nThe film does have its faults and for me there two main problems: The first, I've never read the book but from what I understand in the movie, a Jumper can withstand a large amount of electricity - higher than normal people do. But some of the hits David got in the action sequences should have killed him if he's physically like any human, which seem to be the case and would have been a great weakness to have for the character, a regular guy who can teleport. The second problems is the ending of the film, it's not the best, I could have come up with something better.\n\nAnyway, I liked Jumper when it came out, even though I always knew that there wouldn't be a sequel. It's an entertaining movie and over the years, whenever I watched it back I found those little pop culture references that I hadn't notice before. For example this time around I noticed a Marvel Team up reference that is kind of overused but is still cool.\n\n@wornoutspines","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":290976,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even her charismatic presence and black skin tight couture can not salvage this narrative quagmire from Director and Writer Neil Marshall. Marshall was actually very effective in "The Descent". That makes what happened here even more bewildering. "Doomsday" is a mutated clone on a number of levels. Beautiful Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale of "Underworld", but is a more athletic version. The comparisons to "Underworld" are warranted-- in particular the Gothic nihilistic tone. No Vampires. Instead we have cannibalistic survivors of a deadly man-made virus. The "Doomsday" post apocalyptic world of 2033 lands as a cheap rip-off of "The Road Warrior" and "Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome". At times enduring the grotesque cinematic chaos becomes insufferable. There is a protracted scene in which one of Major Sinclair's (Mitra's) men is charred crispy and then consumed. "Doomsday" begins with a promising premise, but soon spirals out of control into the narrative abyss. This is too bad, because Mitra plays a great hero and Malcolm McDowell garners enough restraint as the compelling antagonist Kane.\n\nIn 2008 a lethal virus eradicates Scotland killing hundreds of thousands of people. The Government in a radical measure to contain and quarantine the area erects an impenetrable Wall along the British border. One of those lucky to escape during this turmoil is young Eden Sinclair. Her mother apparently sacrifices her life to save her. The young child grows into Major Sinclair (Mitra), who is now a powerful and capable warrior.\n\nIn 2033, the virus re-emerges in England; thus threatening total annihilation. However, intelligence photos of the quarantine region reveal survivors. Therefore, a cure for the virus may exist somewhere beyond the Wall. Prime Minister John Hatcher's (Alexander Siddig) national and political survival rests on finding this cure. Apparently Kane (whacked out Malcolm McDowell), who discovered the virus, may have developed an anti-virus. Hatcher tasks his security minister Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins) to assemble a military team to retrieve the cure from the quarantine region. Nelson enrolls Major Sinclair (Mitra) to lead this mission. Sinclair quickly assembles her team, and they embark on their mission to find Kane and the cure. Once behind the Wall, the mission goes amokpredictably. Turns out that Kane (McDowell) has recreated his new world as a quasi-medieval existence where only the strong survive. From this point on the mission much like the movie becomes murky and incomprehensible.\n\nEven as a straight action movie "Doomsday" is puzzling. The quick cut edits, and dark atmosphere do little in defining crisp and engaging action sequences. Mitra performs the fight scenes admirably, though I'm guessing she is not a trained martial artist. It just comes off as sloppy. Most of the cloned "Road Warrior" high speed chases are embarrassing.\n\nThe conclusion of "Doomsday" makes no sense at all. What was Neil Marshall's point? There are a bunch of silly post apocalyptic mutant zombie movies out there, and this one is really unpleasant and not all that much fun. Rhona Mitra and Malcolm McDowell are completely wasted here. And "Doomsday" was nearly a complete waste of two hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74591,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even her charismatic presence and black skin tight couture can not salvage this narrative quagmire from Director and Writer Neil Marshall. Marshall was actually very effective in "The Descent". That makes what happened here even more bewildering. "Doomsday" is a mutated clone on a number of levels. Beautiful Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale of "Underworld", but is a more athletic version. The comparisons to "Underworld" are warranted-- in particular the Gothic nihilistic tone. No Vampires. Instead we have cannibalistic survivors of a deadly man-made virus. The "Doomsday" post apocalyptic world of 2033 lands as a cheap rip-off of "The Road Warrior" and "Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome". At times enduring the grotesque cinematic chaos becomes insufferable. There is a protracted scene in which one of Major Sinclair's (Mitra's) men is charred crispy and then consumed. "Doomsday" begins with a promising premise, but soon spirals out of control into the narrative abyss. This is too bad, because Mitra plays a great hero and Malcolm McDowell garners enough restraint as the compelling antagonist Kane.\n\nIn 2008 a lethal virus eradicates Scotland killing hundreds of thousands of people. The Government in a radical measure to contain and quarantine the area erects an impenetrable Wall along the British border. One of those lucky to escape during this turmoil is young Eden Sinclair. Her mother apparently sacrifices her life to save her. The young child grows into Major Sinclair (Mitra), who is now a powerful and capable warrior.\n\nIn 2033, the virus re-emerges in England; thus threatening total annihilation. However, intelligence photos of the quarantine region reveal survivors. Therefore, a cure for the virus may exist somewhere beyond the Wall. Prime Minister John Hatcher's (Alexander Siddig) national and political survival rests on finding this cure. Apparently Kane (whacked out Malcolm McDowell), who discovered the virus, may have developed an anti-virus. Hatcher tasks his security minister Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins) to assemble a military team to retrieve the cure from the quarantine region. Nelson enrolls Major Sinclair (Mitra) to lead this mission. Sinclair quickly assembles her team, and they embark on their mission to find Kane and the cure. Once behind the Wall, the mission goes amokpredictably. Turns out that Kane (McDowell) has recreated his new world as a quasi-medieval existence where only the strong survive. From this point on the mission much like the movie becomes murky and incomprehensible.\n\nEven as a straight action movie "Doomsday" is puzzling. The quick cut edits, and dark atmosphere do little in defining crisp and engaging action sequences. Mitra performs the fight scenes admirably, though I'm guessing she is not a trained martial artist. It just comes off as sloppy. Most of the cloned "Road Warrior" high speed chases are embarrassing.\n\nThe conclusion of "Doomsday" makes no sense at all. What was Neil Marshall's point? There are a bunch of silly post apocalyptic mutant zombie movies out there, and this one is really unpleasant and not all that much fun. Rhona Mitra and Malcolm McDowell are completely wasted here. And "Doomsday" was nearly a complete waste of two hours.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74591,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Allison (Bridget Fonda) places the ad after her fiance, Sam (Steven Weber), turns out to be a not-so charming prince. Yep, he's been cheating on her.\n\nEnter Hedra "Hedy" Carlson (Jennifer Jason-Leigh), who appears to be the perfect candidate. At first, all goes amazingly well, and the two get along great. Of course, this wouldn't be much of a thriller if everything went peachy. So, it's not long before Sam starts wooing Allison back, and Hedy starts exhibiting some odd quirks and rather unsettling behaviors. Things only get worse from here. What's a woman-gone-berserk to do next? Why, kill everyone in her way, naturally!\n\nSWF came out at a time when similar psychological thrillers were all the rage. Ms.' Fonda and Jason-Leigh are quite good in their roles, with Allison going from clueless to suspicious to fighting for survival, while Hedy goes from seemingly shy to completely bananas! Those who love this sort of movie will love this one. Those who don't, can blame FATAL ATTRACTION.\n\nP.S.- Anyone enamored with the female form will be overjoyed to know that both Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason-Leigh spend relatively lengthy periods of time in their birthday suits!...","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It deals with German Emperor Barbarossa who wants to return the Holy Roman Empire , following his ascendant , the great emperor Charlomagno. Federico I Barbarossa , Rutger Hauer , of the dynastic Hohenstaufen (1122-1190) married a very young Queen called Beatriz , Cecile Cassel . Federico I of Suabia will stop at nothing to conquest , and defeat his enemies and to build his powerful empire . However, a young man from Milán called Alberto de Giussano : Raz Degan, along with his troops of 1000 men known as the Company of Death , is prepared to challenge to the emperor . Battlefields run Red with warriors' blood .\n\nBreathtaking and overlong miniseries dealing with historical happenings , about a merciless war between Emperor Federico I and the bustly city of Milan. It delivers acceptable interpretations from Rutger Hauer as the cruel emperor , Cecile Cassel as his wife Beatrice , Raz Degan as Alberto da Giussano , Angela Molinas as a rare clairvoyant and F. Murray Abraham, the Oscarized Salieri, as traitor Barozzi , the latter gives overacting , as usual . The picture contains spectacular scenarios , being shot on several locations from Bucharest , Hunedoara, Transylvania , Alba Lula , Romania .Being sponsored by Italian Cultural Ministry and partially financed by the Northern league or Lega Nord , a political party presided by Umberto Bossi that wants the Italy separation between North and South. Having as main symbol the famous rebel warrior Alberto de Giussano. The motion picture was professionally directed by Renzo Martínelli, though it has some flaws , gaps and failures. Martinelly subsequently made another epical, historical film in similar style : "Day of siege, September Eleven 1683", about the Vienna siege by the Ottoman Empire, also starred by F. Murray Abraham.\n\nBased on facts , these are the following ones : Emperor Federico I carried out 6 campaigns in Italy . In the first Federico battles Armando Brescia rebellion in exchange for being appointed Emperor by Pope Adriano IV. In second one Federico battles Milán , he supported anti-Pope Victor V , against Pope Alexandro III . In third campaign combats Italian cities headed by Verona. In fourth campaign (1166-1168) Imperial army was vanquished by the Lombard league supported by Pope Alexandro III. In fifth campaign (1174-1178) Federico was again defeated in battle Legnano . Later on , Federico I headed third Crusade (1189-1193), accompanied by known kings as Felipe August II of France and Richard LionHeart of England . Federico I embarks in Ratisbona , after crossing Balkans and arrives in Asia Minor . There he defeated the Muslims in batalle Iconio (1190). A bit later on , he died drowned in River Salef , Asia Minor. Federico I was succeeded by his son and heir Henry IV , being crowned in Italy , he married a daughter of the Normand King of the two Sicily kingdom.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1267,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4},"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure: Directed by Mark McLaughlin. With Julie Andrews, Fred Astaire, Obba Babatundé, John Badham. HOLLYWOOD SINGING &amp; DANCING: A MUSICAL TREASURE is a celebration of song and dance, beginning with the Busby Berkeley films that lifted the spirits of audiences during the Great Depression, through the patriotic musicals of the 1940s and ending with the collapse of the studio system in the 1950s. Hosted by Academy Award winning stage, screen and television icon, Shirley Jones, this "docutainment" film is a grand historical look at the magic of musical Hollywood. Highlighted are amazing songs and dance numbers, little-known facts, and luminaries who made the magic possible such as Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Betty Grable, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, James Cagney, Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Donen, Frank Sinatra, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger.

You won't be disappointed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As an "X-Phile" I'm obviously interested in the subject matter. The idea of a show based on the real-life Project Blue Book investigations is intriguing. The historical setting is a nice change of pace.\n\nThe problem is that tonally and conceptually, the show is inconsistent. Characters often seem to have multiple personality disorder.\n\nDuring the course of a typical episode, the two main characters (Aidan Gillen and Michael Malarkey), as well as their immediate superior (Neal McDonough) will vacillate many times between (a) seeming to believe that people are having UFO and alien (and occasionally other Fortean) encounters, (b) seeming to think that the idea of UFO and alien encounters is pure bunk, and (c) being more agnostic about it but seeming to think that their job is (i) ultimately to provide b.s. cover stories for the government, or (ii) ultimately to be subversive and suggest that the government is covering up something.\n\nA lot of screen time that could be spent on investigations is spent on inter-character drama where our stars take turns being on opposing sides of (a), (b), (c)(i) and (c)(ii) above. It becomes confusing. You don't know who is on what side. It's usually not clear what anyone's goal is exactly. And the bosses seem to continually make decisions--including many times that Project Blue Book was going to be closed or at least our investigators fired--that they renege on within 20 minutes.\n\nThe pacing and overall aesthetic--even the style of dialogue delivery, reminds me a lot of the video game L.A. Noire, which wasn't exactly a blockbuster, but it had its fans.\n\nWith less vacillation, better character focus, more attention on weird phenomena and investigations, and a bit more action this could be an excellent show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As an "X-Phile" I'm obviously interested in the subject matter. The idea of a show based on the real-life Project Blue Book investigations is intriguing. The historical setting is a nice change of pace.\n\nThe problem is that tonally and conceptually, the show is inconsistent. Characters often seem to have multiple personality disorder.\n\nDuring the course of a typical episode, the two main characters (Aidan Gillen and Michael Malarkey), as well as their immediate superior (Neal McDonough) will vacillate many times between (a) seeming to believe that people are having UFO and alien (and occasionally other Fortean) encounters, (b) seeming to think that the idea of UFO and alien encounters is pure bunk, and (c) being more agnostic about it but seeming to think that their job is (i) ultimately to provide b.s. cover stories for the government, or (ii) ultimately to be subversive and suggest that the government is covering up something.\n\nA lot of screen time that could be spent on investigations is spent on inter-character drama where our stars take turns being on opposing sides of (a), (b), (c)(i) and (c)(ii) above. It becomes confusing. You don't know who is on what side. It's usually not clear what anyone's goal is exactly. And the bosses seem to continually make decisions--including many times that Project Blue Book was going to be closed or at least our investigators fired--that they renege on within 20 minutes.\n\nThe pacing and overall aesthetic--even the style of dialogue delivery, reminds me a lot of the video game L.A. Noire, which wasn't exactly a blockbuster, but it had its fans.\n\nWith less vacillation, better character focus, more attention on weird phenomena and investigations, and a bit more action this could be an excellent show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I can't rate this properly as it wasn't made for me, but if I look back to my earlier tastes in life, am sure I'd have revelled in this show. The time slot should have given me a clue that it wasn't intended for me and all the gripes I had are answered by it being reworked for it's target audience which doesn't include me. From childhood to 24 I expect I'd have loved this version of Beowulf.

The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.\n\nWe were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)\n\nIt surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. "there will be no X in this family!" X being "instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\n\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them "mama, I miss you."\n\nBeautiful.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":410303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.\n\nWe were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)\n\nIt surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. "there will be no X in this family!" X being "instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\n\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them "mama, I miss you."\n\nBeautiful.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":410303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Hra: Directed by Alejandro Fernández Almendras. With Vladimíra Benoni, Sarah Havacova, Sarah Hlavácová, Danica Jurcová. The world of a young theatre director in a small Czech town crumbles after he decides to realize his dream of adapting an overly ambitious play based on Euripides' classic 'Fedra'. He loses his two main actors during rehearsals and the municipality threatens to cut funding due to the play's political content. Petr falls for young actress Karolina, playing the lead. Tensions at his home grow: he's not much of a present husband and a father. Shortly before the premiere both women leave him. His wife's had enough and Karolina simply disappears. Petr attempts to save his masterpiece, but the play is a fiasco. Devastated, he tries to regain last pieces left of his life.

I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.\n\nReturn of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.\n\nThe storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin &amp; Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.\n\nThis is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)\n\nThe worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1679342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9},"duration":"PT3H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.\n\nReturn of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.\n\nThe storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin &amp; Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.\n\nThis is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)\n\nThe worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1679342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9,"duration":"PT3H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL \n\nWarner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book "super-hero", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close Let's try to keep things in perspective, O.K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS! \n\n10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! \n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1338494,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"duration":"PT2H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL \n\nWarner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book "super-hero", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close Let's try to keep things in perspective, O.K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS! \n\n10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! \n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1338494,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Although it doesn't get into the nuts and bolts of diplomatic deal making, I think it's quite instructive of the power of getting opposing sides to the table for talks. Of course, we now know the Oslo Accords ultimately failed, but the process for which they came about remains truly inspirational.\n\nAlso, Ruth Wilson was wonderful and delivered a quietly powerful performance.\n\nTempted to give this film 10/10 to balance out the politically motivated ratings. But it's really an 8 for me.\n\nP.s. Teachers in university IR courses or high school social studies classes, this would be a great film to watch and discuss during units on international diplomacy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Oslo stars Ruth Wilson as Mona Juul, a Norwegian foreign minister, and Andrew Scott as Terje Rod-Larsen, a Norwegian sociologist and Mona’s husband.

It really humanized the difficult process of international diplomacy. Although it doesn't get into the nuts and bolts of diplomatic deal making, I think it's quite instructive of the power of getting opposing sides to the table for talks. Of course, we now know the Oslo Accords ultimately failed, but the process for which they came about remains truly inspirational.\n\nAlso, Ruth Wilson was wonderful and delivered a quietly powerful performance.\n\nTempted to give this film 10/10 to balance out the politically motivated ratings. But it's really an 8 for me.\n\nP.s. Teachers in university IR courses or high school social studies classes, this would be a great film to watch and discuss during units on international diplomacy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few. Adonis "Donny" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series. Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies. On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out. Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle. Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason. In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is a crime drama that integrates real world political happenings, which is something SOA did not do. The time period we are currently in differs from 2008 when SOA debuted; there is a lot happening that is getting our attention &amp; Mayans focuses part of its lens on what is impacting a segment of people in the world. For those saying it is "soap opera-esque" - it is a drama series &amp; so yes, storylines will be just that - dramatic! There are enough SOA references or "Easter Eggs" to get SOA Nation excited, however, this is a new &amp; different world of MC &amp; should be viewed that way. Excellent opening theme song for Season 1 &amp; some really good music throughout - arguably, at times, better than what we heard in SOA.

This is a crime drama that integrates real world political happenings, which is something SOA did not do. The time period we are currently in differs from 2008 when SOA debuted; there is a lot happening that is getting our attention &amp; Mayans focuses part of its lens on what is impacting a segment of people in the world. For those saying it is "soap opera-esque" - it is a drama series &amp; so yes, storylines will be just that - dramatic! There are enough SOA references or "Easter Eggs" to get SOA Nation excited, however, this is a new &amp; different world of MC &amp; should be viewed that way. Excellent opening theme song for Season 1 &amp; some really good music throughout - arguably, at times, better than what we heard in SOA. The Mayans are not the Sons &amp; they are not supposed to be; they are an MC unto itself with its own story to tell.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yes, It's a genre that's been done a lot, but that doesn't make this film inherently bad.\n\nIt had some enjoyable moments in it.\n\nI have immense amounts of respect for the crew who worked on this movie, due to how much the internet kicked up a storm and how they worked tirelessly to try re-jig the movie to make it work. That doesn't mean the movie is perfect, but the respect for the craft is there.\n\nLong story short; It's not a perfect movie, but you can tell that effort was made in it's creation. Had some enjoyable moments and would definitely encourage people to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100378,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I admit it's a little bit heavy and dark and dramatic at times, but hey... all great stories are! A girl would love it anyways. Emo/goth teens too. It's a well-done art movie where actors did their job as they are suplosed to and the atmosphere is very distinctive, special and personal.

I'm sick and tired of all those cheap, predictable stories where special effects are more important than the actual script. It also made me more receptive to classical music. I admit it's a little bit heavy and dark and dramatic at times, but hey... all great stories are! A girl would love it anyways. Emo/goth teens too. It's a well-done art movie where actors did their job as they are suplosed to and the atmosphere is very distinctive, special and personal. Maximum value for your time and a valuable life lesson for those willing to learn.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So Long My Son picks up that chronological baton, and tells a story about family bonds, the meaning of friendship and what constitutes our morals and ethics through the last 30/40 years of Chinese history, from a stilted, materially basic time of 1980 through to the hypermodernity of China in the 2010s.\n\nIn the same way To Live aimed thinly disguised critiques at the Chinese government's policies through showing its impact on ordinary people, So Long My Son fires a number of shots too and it's in fact a little surprising to me some of these have been overlooked by the censors. The most obvious of them is the criticism of the one child policy, but hidden in there too are mentions of the privatisation of state owned industries in the early 90s and the mass redundancies that went with them, as well as criticism of the wealth inequality of modern China that has ensued from the market economy transition of the 80s and 90s.\n\nI'm unsure if this was a problem specific to the release version I saw, though I have seen other reviews saying the plot was hard to follow, but I noticed that the English subtitles was often only translating about 1/5 of the dialogue in Mandarin. As a speaker of both, I followed the plot and characters quite easily, but can absolutely understand why many reviewers and comments have said they found the characters and plots hard to distinguish if the subtitling was a problem. However, with one eye on the subtitles, I think the fact they were missing a lot of the Mandarin dialogue would have created a really dreamy plotline that complements well the cinematographic style deployed - long panoramic shots that suddenly cut into a character's perspective; languid sequences that soak in the environment; and shots designed to make the audience feel voyeurs in a private situation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT3H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Melina Havelock (Bouquet convincing) is tough and driven by revenge for her murdered parents, adept with a crossbow she makes a sturdy accomplice for Bond, and thankfully their union isn't bogged down mid mission by the "between the sheets" angle. Elsewhere, 007 editor John Glenn directs the first of his 5 Bond movies, impressive first outing with the underwater scenes particularly striking. Hume brings Corfu to life via his colour lenses and Conti oversees one of the series' best title theme songs, song with deep emotional beauty by Sheena Easton. His overall score is merely adequate, with decent nationalistic flavours, but the theme song is so strong it lingers to this day in the memory of all Bond fans.\n\nIt's not all great in this stripped back Bond world, though. The pre-credits sequence makes the terrible mistake of negating Bond's visit to the grave of his late wife, Tracy, by then having him jostle and jape with a bald villain in a wheelchair (is it meant to be Blofeld?): with unconvincing lines and delivery in the mix as well. Lynn-Holly Johnson's Bibi Dahl character is as pointless as it gets, out of place and superfluous to the plot.

Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino's short, but distinguished list.\n\nKill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.\n\nThe movie is really a combination of Tarantino's love for the 70's over-dramatized Kung-Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool-Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale's blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.\n\nThere are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantino's continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's films, you should pass on this one because it is doesn't stray to far from his other stuff.

    <title lang="hr">Kill Bill: Vol 2</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Prisjećajući se sretnog dana kada je uvježbavala svoje skorašnje crkveno vjenčanje, nevjesta (U. Thurman), ne želi odustati od nauma da ubije preostala tri člana bande koji su je umalo ubili. Nekoć ih je na popisu bilo petero. Sada ih je troje. O-Ren Ishii i Vernita Green prve su pale, a sada Mladenka (Uma Thurman) kreće dovršiti posao i ubiti Elle Driver, Budda i, konačno, Billa (David Carradine). Ako se preostala trojka već ne boji, bolje im je da počnu jer im je ona za petama. Međutim, neke joj stvari mrvicu poremete planove. Njezina kći (koju je nosila u vrijeme kada se trebala udati) još je živa. Nije jasno kako će to utjecati na njezinu misiju osvete, no glavno je pitanje hoće li Mladenka uspjeti ostvariti svoj konačni cilj - ubiti Billa.</desc>

I immediately had flashbacks to "Stand By Me". That said, I think "Mud" is a better movie. I thought the acting was exceptional, the photography both real and lush, the lighting well done, and the story was fresh, real, and terrific. The direction MUST have been terrific also, as the result is a near-perfect film that everyone can and should enjoy. \n\nThe 2 young actors (playing the characters of Ellis and Neckbone) were amazing -- especially Tye Sheridan playing the lead character, Ellis.

I immediately had flashbacks to "Stand By Me". That said, I think "Mud" is a better movie. I thought the acting was exceptional, the photography both real and lush, the lighting well done, and the story was fresh, real, and terrific. The direction MUST have been terrific also, as the result is a near-perfect film that everyone can and should enjoy. \n\nThe 2 young actors (playing the characters of Ellis and Neckbone) were amazing -- especially Tye Sheridan playing the lead character, Ellis. Sam Shepherd was great as Ellis' "assassin" neighbor (and longtime friend of Mud), the actor who played Ellis' dad was TERRIFIC and stole every scene he was in.

The poorly done backdrop of a crowd during Caine's speech made it clear that this film was meant to be a joke, as did his responses to her letters, and I found myself chuckling over the intentional ridiculousness of it all a number of times during the film.\n\nThe story is easy to follow, the editing is well handled, the casting was fine, the acting ranged from adequate to really good, so anybody who thinks this film is worth only 1/10 must have only just started watching movies yesterday, having started with Ben Hur.

On second thoughts - let's not.\n\nThere is life left in the film world for Scooby-Doo. Honestly, I'm not joking. I acknowledge that the sequel isn't actually that good (I avoided the first one on critical advice) but it would be churlish for me to say it is unbearable. In fact, it's actually watchable to an extent. It's great to look at, and I'll admit to getting a reasonable number of laughs from it. \n\n But I still can't recommend the film. It's too childish, doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or not, and above all, is just far too disjointed. Someone should've told the director that the way to approach a film like this is to play it for laughs the whole way through, and have a story that will, in some way, reach out to adults. This is more playground fare than family entertainment. And, on top of all that, it has the wooden Freddie Prinze Jr. as the lead, although thankfully not much is expected of him, or anyone in the cast. Still, blink and you'll miss a wasted Tim Blake Nelson. (You won't miss the latest American Idol, though...)\n\nThis is one for the cartoon's audience, children or anyone who's really, really bored and just needs a bit of a laugh. I'm sure it'll really amuse the kids both at home and in the cinema (believe me, nothing will be lost to DVD), although I can't see many of the general public wanting to watch the whole thing again."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52041,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

On second thoughts - let's not.\n\nThere is life left in the film world for Scooby-Doo. Honestly, I'm not joking. I acknowledge that the sequel isn't actually that good (I avoided the first one on critical advice) but it would be churlish for me to say it is unbearable. In fact, it's actually watchable to an extent. It's great to look at, and I'll admit to getting a reasonable number of laughs from it. \n\n But I still can't recommend the film. It's too childish, doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or not, and above all, is just far too disjointed. Someone should've told the director that the way to approach a film like this is to play it for laughs the whole way through, and have a story that will, in some way, reach out to adults. This is more playground fare than family entertainment. And, on top of all that, it has the wooden Freddie Prinze Jr. as the lead, although thankfully not much is expected of him, or anyone in the cast. Still, blink and you'll miss a wasted Tim Blake Nelson. (You won't miss the latest American Idol, though...)\n\nThis is one for the cartoon's audience, children or anyone who's really, really bored and just needs a bit of a laugh. I'm sure it'll really amuse the kids both at home and in the cinema (believe me, nothing will be lost to DVD), although I can't see many of the general public wanting to watch the whole thing again.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52041,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I have a tough time being "cruel" to a movie like this because I was informed beforehand of Bakshi's well-meaning intentions here. I'm not a Bakshi fan, but I appreciate what he has been attempting to do even if I personally don't care for the content of his movies.\n\nWhile Bakshi certainly has a reputation for creating films that have outraged, offended and (with certain audiences) entertained, he is also known by those who have met him for being someone who indeed genuinely cares about people, wants to use his medium to show how messed up our modern society is and how folks can triumph over the worst of difficulties while trapped within it. The only problem is that he has a tough time communicating with others, both personally and through his films. Somewhere beneath all the X-ratings and reputation, there is indeed (believe it or not) a very caring, sensitive man.\n\nBelieve it or not, he had thought of COOL WORLD as a statement speaking out on the dangers of casual sex (his proclamation, not mine). He's trying to point out just how dangerous such actions can be so as to caution his audience about bodily responsibility. And, he had hoped, might even help save lives.\n\nThe problem is that his movie is simply a mess. I've been informed all about the insiders' stories regarding what went wrong with this production (apparently there was even at least a couple of extra hours of this movie made!!), including the fact that its storyline was made up as Bakshi went along (a habit he has, I'm told, with all of his films).\n\nThe technical flaws, acting and everything else here are by now legendary to the public, so (even though it's certainly not a favourite title of mine) I'm going to instead point out four things I *did* actually enjoy about the movie.\n\n(1) Conceptual designer Barry Jackson's background designs and paintings are absolutely brilliant. People familiar with my own work already know that I've spent a lifetime drawing stuff similar to this sort of "twisted background" style, so I in particular was fascinated and impressed by Jackson's amazing work even if it was emotionally the exact opposite of the sort of atmospheres I create. I actually took the time back in 1992 to call him up and compliment him personally on his material in COOL WORLD; it's that impressive. But VERY dark as it appears in this film, which is as a city imagined in the troubled and desperate mind of a jailed cartoonist.\n\n(2) I enjoy most of the music on the soundtrack: Mark Isham's score is to die for, and many of the songs here are a lot of fun, especially David Bowie's title piece that plays over the ending credits and The Thompson Twins' "Play With Me" which blares over the opening. (An interesting piece of musical trivia here: there is a song called "Mindless" which only credits itself as "Written by Mindless", "Performed by Mindless" and "Produced by Mindless". I wonder who it really is...? Spooky...)\n\n(3) Holli Would is a thoroughly detestable character; many say she has no personality, but that isn't the case. She has one, alright... a selfish, cruel, insensitive personality that doesn't care about anybody or anything else (much less the results of her own actions) as long as she gets her own way. She may be physically more beautiful technically than Jessica Rabbit, but Jessica is by far the more wonderful "ideal woman" of the two in terms of her true blue intentions and personality. So it probably comes as no surprise that there is *ONE* scene in the whole film which *IS* funny; it's at the very end, after the Spike of Power is plugged back where it belongs. For a split second, we see Holli do in shock the most hilariously unflattering take you have EVER seen! Watching her be put through such a hysterical piece of animation after her being so selfish and design-perfect throughout the rest of the film is a delight. ...and finally,\n\n(4) Yes, it is a sloppy film. And so far, I'm convinced it's the messiest film of it's type I've ever seen. But at least it had good intentions, which does place it a mark above other movies out there which were simply offensive dreck without any intentions at all. I may not enjoy the movie and never will, but I do personally forgive Bakshi this film because I know he was trying to say something important for others' sake."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have a tough time being "cruel" to a movie like this because I was informed beforehand of Bakshi's well-meaning intentions here. I'm not a Bakshi fan, but I appreciate what he has been attempting to do even if I personally don't care for the content of his movies.\n\nWhile Bakshi certainly has a reputation for creating films that have outraged, offended and (with certain audiences) entertained, he is also known by those who have met him for being someone who indeed genuinely cares about people, wants to use his medium to show how messed up our modern society is and how folks can triumph over the worst of difficulties while trapped within it. The only problem is that he has a tough time communicating with others, both personally and through his films. Somewhere beneath all the X-ratings and reputation, there is indeed (believe it or not) a very caring, sensitive man.\n\nBelieve it or not, he had thought of COOL WORLD as a statement speaking out on the dangers of casual sex (his proclamation, not mine). He's trying to point out just how dangerous such actions can be so as to caution his audience about bodily responsibility. And, he had hoped, might even help save lives.\n\nThe problem is that his movie is simply a mess. I've been informed all about the insiders' stories regarding what went wrong with this production (apparently there was even at least a couple of extra hours of this movie made!!), including the fact that its storyline was made up as Bakshi went along (a habit he has, I'm told, with all of his films).\n\nThe technical flaws, acting and everything else here are by now legendary to the public, so (even though it's certainly not a favourite title of mine) I'm going to instead point out four things I *did* actually enjoy about the movie.\n\n(1) Conceptual designer Barry Jackson's background designs and paintings are absolutely brilliant. People familiar with my own work already know that I've spent a lifetime drawing stuff similar to this sort of "twisted background" style, so I in particular was fascinated and impressed by Jackson's amazing work even if it was emotionally the exact opposite of the sort of atmospheres I create. I actually took the time back in 1992 to call him up and compliment him personally on his material in COOL WORLD; it's that impressive. But VERY dark as it appears in this film, which is as a city imagined in the troubled and desperate mind of a jailed cartoonist.\n\n(2) I enjoy most of the music on the soundtrack: Mark Isham's score is to die for, and many of the songs here are a lot of fun, especially David Bowie's title piece that plays over the ending credits and The Thompson Twins' "Play With Me" which blares over the opening. (An interesting piece of musical trivia here: there is a song called "Mindless" which only credits itself as "Written by Mindless", "Performed by Mindless" and "Produced by Mindless". I wonder who it really is...? Spooky...)\n\n(3) Holli Would is a thoroughly detestable character; many say she has no personality, but that isn't the case. She has one, alright... a selfish, cruel, insensitive personality that doesn't care about anybody or anything else (much less the results of her own actions) as long as she gets her own way. She may be physically more beautiful technically than Jessica Rabbit, but Jessica is by far the more wonderful "ideal woman" of the two in terms of her true blue intentions and personality. So it probably comes as no surprise that there is *ONE* scene in the whole film which *IS* funny; it's at the very end, after the Spike of Power is plugged back where it belongs. For a split second, we see Holli do in shock the most hilariously unflattering take you have EVER seen! Watching her be put through such a hysterical piece of animation after her being so selfish and design-perfect throughout the rest of the film is a delight. ...and finally,\n\n(4) Yes, it is a sloppy film. And so far, I'm convinced it's the messiest film of it's type I've ever seen. But at least it had good intentions, which does place it a mark above other movies out there which were simply offensive dreck without any intentions at all. I may not enjoy the movie and never will, but I do personally forgive Bakshi this film because I know he was trying to say something important for others' sake.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are some funny adult jokes too. The film has heart and that's what works for it. Shankman and his cast and crew must have had a great time (as was also apparent on the DVD extras). Steve Martin and Eugene Levy are good. Martin has played the comedic family dad perhaps more than a dozen times and he has become quite skilled at it. The extremely talented Bonnie Hunt is criminally underused but she has an effective presence, nonetheless. Carmen Electra is a surprise. She plays a hot mom but not the clichéd one, rather one that is compassionate, gentle and caring. Electra does a good job and proves that she can do more than being just an airhead or a seductress. Piper Perabo is also underused. Jaime King is very pretty. Hilary Duff plays sort of a spoilt brat (which is a change from her sweet pretty girl image) but her acting is quite bad and she needs to eat. The child actors were all fun to watch. Overall, it's all goofy family fun and quite enjoyable when watching with the family."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55765,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have a tough time being "cruel" to a movie like this because I was informed beforehand of Bakshi's well-meaning intentions here. I'm not a Bakshi fan, but I appreciate what he has been attempting to do even if I personally don't care for the content of his movies.\n\nWhile Bakshi certainly has a reputation for creating films that have outraged, offended and (with certain audiences) entertained, he is also known by those who have met him for being someone who indeed genuinely cares about people, wants to use his medium to show how messed up our modern society is and how folks can triumph over the worst of difficulties while trapped within it. The only problem is that he has a tough time communicating with others, both personally and through his films. Somewhere beneath all the X-ratings and reputation, there is indeed (believe it or not) a very caring, sensitive man.\n\nBelieve it or not, he had thought of COOL WORLD as a statement speaking out on the dangers of casual sex (his proclamation, not mine). He's trying to point out just how dangerous such actions can be so as to caution his audience about bodily responsibility. And, he had hoped, might even help save lives.\n\nThe problem is that his movie is simply a mess. I've been informed all about the insiders' stories regarding what went wrong with this production (apparently there was even at least a couple of extra hours of this movie made!!), including the fact that its storyline was made up as Bakshi went along (a habit he has, I'm told, with all of his films).\n\nThe technical flaws, acting and everything else here are by now legendary to the public, so (even though it's certainly not a favourite title of mine) I'm going to instead point out four things I *did* actually enjoy about the movie.\n\n(1) Conceptual designer Barry Jackson's background designs and paintings are absolutely brilliant. People familiar with my own work already know that I've spent a lifetime drawing stuff similar to this sort of "twisted background" style, so I in particular was fascinated and impressed by Jackson's amazing work even if it was emotionally the exact opposite of the sort of atmospheres I create. I actually took the time back in 1992 to call him up and compliment him personally on his material in COOL WORLD; it's that impressive. But VERY dark as it appears in this film, which is as a city imagined in the troubled and desperate mind of a jailed cartoonist.\n\n(2) I enjoy most of the music on the soundtrack: Mark Isham's score is to die for, and many of the songs here are a lot of fun, especially David Bowie's title piece that plays over the ending credits and The Thompson Twins' "Play With Me" which blares over the opening. (An interesting piece of musical trivia here: there is a song called "Mindless" which only credits itself as "Written by Mindless", "Performed by Mindless" and "Produced by Mindless". I wonder who it really is...? Spooky...)\n\n(3) Holli Would is a thoroughly detestable character; many say she has no personality, but that isn't the case. She has one, alright... a selfish, cruel, insensitive personality that doesn't care about anybody or anything else (much less the results of her own actions) as long as she gets her own way. She may be physically more beautiful technically than Jessica Rabbit, but Jessica is by far the more wonderful "ideal woman" of the two in terms of her true blue intentions and personality. So it probably comes as no surprise that there is *ONE* scene in the whole film which *IS* funny; it's at the very end, after the Spike of Power is plugged back where it belongs. For a split second, we see Holli do in shock the most hilariously unflattering take you have EVER seen! Watching her be put through such a hysterical piece of animation after her being so selfish and design-perfect throughout the rest of the film is a delight. ...and finally,\n\n(4) Yes, it is a sloppy film. And so far, I'm convinced it's the messiest film of it's type I've ever seen. But at least it had good intentions, which does place it a mark above other movies out there which were simply offensive dreck without any intentions at all. I may not enjoy the movie and never will, but I do personally forgive Bakshi this film because I know he was trying to say something important for others' sake."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That does not mean that the film is absent of entertainment. It pretty much follows the usual formula with the regular ingredients. The slapstick and jokes are expected but still amusing. There are some funny adult jokes too. The film has heart and that's what works for it. Shankman and his cast and crew must have had a great time (as was also apparent on the DVD extras). Steve Martin and Eugene Levy are good. Martin has played the comedic family dad perhaps more than a dozen times and he has become quite skilled at it. The extremely talented Bonnie Hunt is criminally underused but she has an effective presence, nonetheless. Carmen Electra is a surprise. She plays a hot mom but not the clichéd one, rather one that is compassionate, gentle and caring. Electra does a good job and proves that she can do more than being just an airhead or a seductress. Piper Perabo is also underused. Jaime King is very pretty. Hilary Duff plays sort of a spoilt brat (which is a change from her sweet pretty girl image) but her acting is quite bad and she needs to eat. The child actors were all fun to watch. Overall, it's all goofy family fun and quite enjoyable when watching with the family.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55765,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm actually a little surprised that the film didn't turn out to be better since the trailer was entertaining and the premise offered something a little different.

The loosely-structured plot deals with calling up the past, which it says you can't really do because it's gone, and not worrying about the future because it isn't here yet. Murray plays a computer businessman, a committed bachelor and "over-the-hill Don Juan", who receives news he might have fathered a child with an ex-girlfriend 20 years ago. The film, helmed under the more effective title "Dead Flowers", is an unintended journey of self-discovery which is purposely incomplete but not pointless; the screenplay leaves the scenario open for discussion, and writer-director Jim Jarmusch structures each sequence in such a cockeyed way that we don't really know where the movie is headed. This is perfect for audiences interested in something a little different, and even if the pacing is dryly solemn or slow, the picture delights in being anti-formula. A very good film, difficult as an entertainment per se and often puzzling or obtuse, though it continues Bill Murray on the path of an actor of incredible taste, decision and consequence. *** from ****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99882,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The loosely-structured plot deals with calling up the past, which it says you can't really do because it's gone, and not worrying about the future because it isn't here yet. Murray plays a computer businessman, a committed bachelor and "over-the-hill Don Juan", who receives news he might have fathered a child with an ex-girlfriend 20 years ago. The film, helmed under the more effective title "Dead Flowers", is an unintended journey of self-discovery which is purposely incomplete but not pointless; the screenplay leaves the scenario open for discussion, and writer-director Jim Jarmusch structures each sequence in such a cockeyed way that we don't really know where the movie is headed. This is perfect for audiences interested in something a little different, and even if the pacing is dryly solemn or slow, the picture delights in being anti-formula. A very good film, difficult as an entertainment per se and often puzzling or obtuse, though it continues Bill Murray on the path of an actor of incredible taste, decision and consequence. *** from ****","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99882,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

No wonder anyone would want to try to relive that magic! So now there is Brideshead the movie. That means the director had to grasp the original TV show in two hours, so no other choice than a 'The Best Of' compilation remains, it seems.The disadvantage of it is, that what is left out suddenly becomes painfully missing. \n\nAll of us who have watched the TV series know it is virtually impossible to surpass it, in film or TV production. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it without prejudice. Overall not a bad movie, but no, not the magical resonance the original had. \n\nAll I can do is summarize in details the pluses and minuses of the film versus the TV production so here it goes:\n\nThe fathers from original were two of the best actors of the century; John Geilgud (Shakespeare) and the (incomparable) Laurence Olivier. Geilgud plays brilliantly the teasing but not totally indifferent father, who seems stop Charles from the insipid surroundings in the summer but finally lets him go. In the TV series the actor is more serious, and the fun is not there. Laurence had probably one of the best performances of all, and clearly echoes his naughtiness as he portrayed in A Little Romance then a few years earlier. His unpredictability which finally makes him decide for his daughter is well done, especially considered his playground was virtually no more than a static death bed! And then the scene where he is offered a ride in a car down the steps, which he refuses since he doesn't want to admit it might be his last. \n\nMatthew Goode does quite a good job as a substitute of Jeremy Irons. I like especially his ambivalent apparition (homosexual, heterosexual, both, or doesn't it matter?). But he lacks the wonderful narrating voice of Irons, which research has shown to be one of the best around. In the film the romance between Charles and Sebastian's sister is elaborated much more. Partially I agree with this choice. In the original not enough scenes were implanted for credibility, except probably the scene where Charles lights her cigarette. They were virtually strangers meeting again on the cruiser years later and nevertheless they seemed to suddenly hit it off. The sister was not what stood Charles' and Sebastian's friendship in the way. The filmmakers choose for more stress on their impending romance. I think the TV original did this better; it was the family that Charles became part of, and Sebastian's indifference to love that became unsurpassable problems. In original the mother was almost invisible, with the exception of some quotes on her son like 'I don't understand it', which summed it all up. We do not need the dialog in the film where she explains herself, and wonders why her kids hate her. Understatement is much more powerful, also in the scene 'I'll say no more' between Charles and Julia, in which it becomes clear religion has driven them apart. One sentence can be enough. \n\nAll this was at the cost of stress Sebastian could have had, and got in the TV original. Most of the magic of Brideshead was simply Anthony Andrews' performance. Worse, the movie clearly alludes to a homosexual relationship, which it did not need to be. Sebastian was a love object, and could be loved by anyone, in any way. But then again, it might be hard finding someone that could deliver the line about Sebastian as Irons narrated: 'his beauty, arresting'. Charm was the problem, the danger. That missed in this film. It was charm that nearly got Charles astray, as told by the queer friend years later in his atelier. The film omitted this important scene, where that friend tried to warn Charles for Sebastian. At the time we all thought it was a nasty remark, but later on he seemed to be right. Or was the charm not an illusion after all? The film simply did not have enough time to build up the charm Sebastian surely had in the TV original. In the TV series Charles was shown first with boring friends, and it then became shortly a coming of age story, where he got introduced in a more fun crowd with Sebastian. This phase delivered some of the best scenes of the story, with his queer friend talking loud over the campus, or Sebastian dressing up as a man with mustache. Sebastian showed Charles other worlds, which real or not, were unforgettable. The film had to rush this too much, and therefore the introduction scene with the spring eggs lost its magic.\n\nOne of the few pluses was much less stress on Cordelia, the little girl. But the minus was she acted as an indirect narrator of the importance of religion. Now it had to be compensated for in dialog with the mother and Julia, which was in TV better since there meaning came out of things not said.\n\nMany things I missed, but you can not cram all in two hours. But lines like 'I would like to remember Sebastian, how he were that summer, when we walked through the enchanted place' should have been told again. \n\nThe end was nicely done, with Charles finally not pinching candlelight, symbolic for the charm of that family that was still alive in him. I liked there the Irons narrative though 'Was it all vanity? Etc.' \n\nI would say, it was a brave attempt, something like making a remake of 2001, or Casablanca or Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the acting was all well done. Also camera work, and story adaptation. But who can surpass Anthony Andrews, or Jeremy Irons, or Gielgud or Olivier?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12475,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No wonder anyone would want to try to relive that magic! So now there is Brideshead the movie. That means the director had to grasp the original TV show in two hours, so no other choice than a 'The Best Of' compilation remains, it seems.The disadvantage of it is, that what is left out suddenly becomes painfully missing. \n\nAll of us who have watched the TV series know it is virtually impossible to surpass it, in film or TV production. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it without prejudice. Overall not a bad movie, but no, not the magical resonance the original had. \n\nAll I can do is summarize in details the pluses and minuses of the film versus the TV production so here it goes:\n\nThe fathers from original were two of the best actors of the century; John Geilgud (Shakespeare) and the (incomparable) Laurence Olivier. Geilgud plays brilliantly the teasing but not totally indifferent father, who seems stop Charles from the insipid surroundings in the summer but finally lets him go. In the TV series the actor is more serious, and the fun is not there. Laurence had probably one of the best performances of all, and clearly echoes his naughtiness as he portrayed in A Little Romance then a few years earlier. His unpredictability which finally makes him decide for his daughter is well done, especially considered his playground was virtually no more than a static death bed! And then the scene where he is offered a ride in a car down the steps, which he refuses since he doesn't want to admit it might be his last. \n\nMatthew Goode does quite a good job as a substitute of Jeremy Irons. I like especially his ambivalent apparition (homosexual, heterosexual, both, or doesn't it matter?). But he lacks the wonderful narrating voice of Irons, which research has shown to be one of the best around. In the film the romance between Charles and Sebastian's sister is elaborated much more. Partially I agree with this choice. In the original not enough scenes were implanted for credibility, except probably the scene where Charles lights her cigarette. They were virtually strangers meeting again on the cruiser years later and nevertheless they seemed to suddenly hit it off. The sister was not what stood Charles' and Sebastian's friendship in the way. The filmmakers choose for more stress on their impending romance. I think the TV original did this better; it was the family that Charles became part of, and Sebastian's indifference to love that became unsurpassable problems. In original the mother was almost invisible, with the exception of some quotes on her son like 'I don't understand it', which summed it all up. We do not need the dialog in the film where she explains herself, and wonders why her kids hate her. Understatement is much more powerful, also in the scene 'I'll say no more' between Charles and Julia, in which it becomes clear religion has driven them apart. One sentence can be enough. \n\nAll this was at the cost of stress Sebastian could have had, and got in the TV original. Most of the magic of Brideshead was simply Anthony Andrews' performance. Worse, the movie clearly alludes to a homosexual relationship, which it did not need to be. Sebastian was a love object, and could be loved by anyone, in any way. But then again, it might be hard finding someone that could deliver the line about Sebastian as Irons narrated: 'his beauty, arresting'. Charm was the problem, the danger. That missed in this film. It was charm that nearly got Charles astray, as told by the queer friend years later in his atelier. The film omitted this important scene, where that friend tried to warn Charles for Sebastian. At the time we all thought it was a nasty remark, but later on he seemed to be right. Or was the charm not an illusion after all? The film simply did not have enough time to build up the charm Sebastian surely had in the TV original. In the TV series Charles was shown first with boring friends, and it then became shortly a coming of age story, where he got introduced in a more fun crowd with Sebastian. This phase delivered some of the best scenes of the story, with his queer friend talking loud over the campus, or Sebastian dressing up as a man with mustache. Sebastian showed Charles other worlds, which real or not, were unforgettable. The film had to rush this too much, and therefore the introduction scene with the spring eggs lost its magic.\n\nOne of the few pluses was much less stress on Cordelia, the little girl. But the minus was she acted as an indirect narrator of the importance of religion. Now it had to be compensated for in dialog with the mother and Julia, which was in TV better since there meaning came out of things not said.\n\nMany things I missed, but you can not cram all in two hours. But lines like 'I would like to remember Sebastian, how he were that summer, when we walked through the enchanted place' should have been told again. \n\nThe end was nicely done, with Charles finally not pinching candlelight, symbolic for the charm of that family that was still alive in him. I liked there the Irons narrative though 'Was it all vanity? Etc.' \n\nI would say, it was a brave attempt, something like making a remake of 2001, or Casablanca or Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the acting was all well done. Also camera work, and story adaptation. But who can surpass Anthony Andrews, or Jeremy Irons, or Gielgud or Olivier?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12475,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Fabio Testi is the Italian agent Renzo who does assignments for Israeli Dan (Assi or Assaf Dayan) for a price. Despite that, they're actually friends. Helga (Janet Agren) is the Swedish woman who works for a German company that makes nuclear weapons. She falls for Renzo. That's all I'll say except this is one exciting movie that I'm glad I watched on YouTube!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film, whose English title is The Uranium Conspiracy, is the first time I've watched a Yoram Globus-Menahem Golan production directed by Golan in its entirety. As a spy thriller involving nuclear weapons, this was quite an exciting flick especially during the boat and car chase scenes. Filmed in many European locations and some sea locales, there were many intrigues that got me hooked throughout the picture. Fabio Testi is the Italian agent Renzo who does assignments for Israeli Dan (Assi or Assaf Dayan) for a price. Despite that, they're actually friends. Helga (Janet Agren) is the Swedish woman who works for a German company that makes nuclear weapons. She falls for Renzo. That's all I'll say except this is one exciting movie that I'm glad I watched on YouTube!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Years later , Diana (One time grown-up performed by Ana Belen) will marry a cocky , wealthy man (Luis Fernando Alves) , she will divorce him and marry an Italian tenor named Raimondi (Carles Sans) .

I liked everyone in the excellent cast, and the male and female actors , especially Penelope Cruz , were all very attractive . I have seen many, Hollywood-romantic-comedies that couldn't compare with this one, but many give them a higher rating because they are Hollywood-made . The screenplay manages a lot of laughs from the audience and romantic elements that you never loose your attention from the film. The only flaw I can find is that some of the story lines are left unexplained and some character arcs end up being implausible. Some situations are laugh out loud ridiculous and the story proceeds at a breakneck speed that never flags . This movie is a lot of fun and well worth the time. I enjoyed the film tremendously and I guarantee you that if you rent it, you'll enjoy it and have a few laughs.

Pereira is an expert on comedies as ¨¨Rose sauce¨, Why do they call it love when they mean sex ?¨, ¨Mouth to mouth¨ , "All Men Are the Same" , though he also has made some drama as ¨The hanged man¨ and ¨Between your legs¨ . His latest projects, however, tanked as "Off Key" starred by an American-all star cast but was a failure both economically and artistically or simply didn't deliver as "Atrévete y Verás" . Nowadays , he directs TV chapters as ¨Gran Reserva¨ and ¨Cheers¨ series .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1612,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I can go on and on about how wonderful "The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies" is - and I have. And I don't need those MST3K idiots adding lame improv chatter to make a bad film more enjoyable! So I had been looking forward to "Skidoo" for years. I finally watched it last night, after procuring a copy on eBay (pretty much the only place where you can find this film, currently).\n\nMy reaction, in a nutshell: Blah. Yuck. Ho hum.\n\nIt's pointless to say more, especially when so many "Skidoo" fans have already weighed in - quite eloquently, I might add - within these comments pages. But I will say this: Usually on the IMDb, when you see so many well-written praises for a famous train wreck of a film, you get the feeling that this is something to see. Don't be snowed as I was! What most of these folks are not telling you is that "Skidoo" is meant to be a wacky comedy. But it's simply a deadening, painful-to-watch document of the twilight of many a great performer's career, where, before either dying or retreating to the safety of TV movies, the cast - some game, some barely even trying (I'm looking at you, Groucho Marx) - flounder in this pathetic attempt by the dinosaurs of 1950's Hollywood to try to stay relevant by making a "hippie movie."\n\nThis film is flat, boring, pretentious and hopelessly uncampy. It has the distinctively ugly look of late 60's studio cinema, and like many of those other strident, unfunny all-star comedies of the era ("The Great Race," "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" et al), it's just plain awful."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I can go on and on about how wonderful "The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies" is - and I have. And I don't need those MST3K idiots adding lame improv chatter to make a bad film more enjoyable! So I had been looking forward to "Skidoo" for years. I finally watched it last night, after procuring a copy on eBay (pretty much the only place where you can find this film, currently).\n\nMy reaction, in a nutshell: Blah. Yuck. Ho hum.\n\nIt's pointless to say more, especially when so many "Skidoo" fans have already weighed in - quite eloquently, I might add - within these comments pages. But I will say this: Usually on the IMDb, when you see so many well-written praises for a famous train wreck of a film, you get the feeling that this is something to see. Don't be snowed as I was! What most of these folks are not telling you is that "Skidoo" is meant to be a wacky comedy. But it's simply a deadening, painful-to-watch document of the twilight of many a great performer's career, where, before either dying or retreating to the safety of TV movies, the cast - some game, some barely even trying (I'm looking at you, Groucho Marx) - flounder in this pathetic attempt by the dinosaurs of 1950's Hollywood to try to stay relevant by making a "hippie movie."\n\nThis film is flat, boring, pretentious and hopelessly uncampy. It has the distinctively ugly look of late 60's studio cinema, and like many of those other strident, unfunny all-star comedies of the era ("The Great Race," "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" et al), it's just plain awful.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Pare ili život</title>
    <desc lang="hr">"Pare ili život" prati glavne likove iz istoimene serije i njihovu nezaboravnu ljetnju avanturu u najljepšim predelima crnogorskog Primorja. "Pare ili život" je dramska, komična TV serija koja prati nekoliko različitih karaktera u sudaru s našom svakodnevnicom. Dramski realizam ove serije nekad se graniči s apsurdom, ali oslobođen je humora po svaku cenu i radije problematizuje neke socijalne fenomene. U društvu koje priželjkuje da je tranzicija već gotova, a ona tek što je počela, javljaju se brojne zamke za sve one koji se "nisu snašli". A Miki, Džoni, Višnja, Sunčica, Marun, Maja i Časlav, nisu sposobni da u novim okolnostima uspeju poput oca njihovog prijatelja Gagija. Razlozi za to nisu ni vaspitanje, ni "devedesete", ni komunizam (pa toliki zakleti komunisti veoma lako su postali uspešni kapitalisti). Na putu do uspeha smetaju im veliko srce i slab stomak. Svi njihovi poduhvati tužni su do smeha, jer je svako raspet između prevaziđenog osećanja zajedništva i želje za ličnim uspehom. Ipak, kad se u njihovim životima pojavi raspevani sanjar Džoni, počinje da se stvara jedna čudna porodica gde svi oni, hteli to ili ne, ostvaruju mnogo jače veze od onih rodbinskih. I usput dobijaju možda mnogo vredniju nagradu od one za kojom sve vreme jure.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je ljubav dvoje mladih, fudbalera Marka Marušića i slikarke Nine Radić. Njihova ljubavna priča je puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je ljubav dvoje mladih, fudbalera Marka Marušića i slikarke Nine Radić. Njihova ljubavna priča je puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Pare ili život</title>
    <desc lang="hr">"Pare ili život" prati glavne likove iz istoimene serije i njihovu nezaboravnu ljetnju avanturu u najljepšim predelima crnogorskog Primorja. "Pare ili život" je dramska, komična TV serija koja prati nekoliko različitih karaktera u sudaru s našom svakodnevnicom. Dramski realizam ove serije nekad se graniči s apsurdom, ali oslobođen je humora po svaku cenu i radije problematizuje neke socijalne fenomene. U društvu koje priželjkuje da je tranzicija već gotova, a ona tek što je počela, javljaju se brojne zamke za sve one koji se "nisu snašli". A Miki, Džoni, Višnja, Sunčica, Marun, Maja i Časlav, nisu sposobni da u novim okolnostima uspeju poput oca njihovog prijatelja Gagija. Razlozi za to nisu ni vaspitanje, ni "devedesete", ni komunizam (pa toliki zakleti komunisti veoma lako su postali uspešni kapitalisti). Na putu do uspeha smetaju im veliko srce i slab stomak. Svi njihovi poduhvati tužni su do smeha, jer je svako raspet između prevaziđenog osećanja zajedništva i želje za ličnim uspehom. Ipak, kad se u njihovim životima pojavi raspevani sanjar Džoni, počinje da se stvara jedna čudna porodica gde svi oni, hteli to ili ne, ostvaruju mnogo jače veze od onih rodbinskih. I usput dobijaju možda mnogo vredniju nagradu od one za kojom sve vreme jure.</desc>

Već znamo da je "Agencija za sve i svašta" vlasotinačko preduzeće koje rešava sve probleme svojih klijenata. Osnivač i vlasnik firme je Spiridon Don Karamarković, nekadašnji pripadnik Legije stranaca, ekspert za sva pitanja i najškrtiji gazda na svetu. Deda mu je rekao da svaki uspešan Srbin mora da ima kafanu i on je ove godine osnovao svoju.

Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu.

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica. S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je ljubav dvoje mladih, fudbalera Marka Marušića i slikarke Nine Radić. Njihova ljubavna priča je puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Pare ili život</title>
    <desc lang="hr">"Pare ili život" prati glavne likove iz istoimene serije i njihovu nezaboravnu ljetnju avanturu u najljepšim predelima crnogorskog Primorja. "Pare ili život" je dramska, komična TV serija koja prati nekoliko različitih karaktera u sudaru s našom svakodnevnicom. Dramski realizam ove serije nekad se graniči s apsurdom, ali oslobođen je humora po svaku cenu i radije problematizuje neke socijalne fenomene. U društvu koje priželjkuje da je tranzicija već gotova, a ona tek što je počela, javljaju se brojne zamke za sve one koji se "nisu snašli". A Miki, Džoni, Višnja, Sunčica, Marun, Maja i Časlav, nisu sposobni da u novim okolnostima uspeju poput oca njihovog prijatelja Gagija. Razlozi za to nisu ni vaspitanje, ni "devedesete", ni komunizam (pa toliki zakleti komunisti veoma lako su postali uspešni kapitalisti). Na putu do uspeha smetaju im veliko srce i slab stomak. Svi njihovi poduhvati tužni su do smeha, jer je svako raspet između prevaziđenog osećanja zajedništva i želje za ličnim uspehom. Ipak, kad se u njihovim životima pojavi raspevani sanjar Džoni, počinje da se stvara jedna čudna porodica gde svi oni, hteli to ili ne, ostvaruju mnogo jače veze od onih rodbinskih. I usput dobijaju možda mnogo vredniju nagradu od one za kojom sve vreme jure.</desc>

S druge strane, nalazi se porodica bankara Maksa Lovreka (Ante Čedo Martinić), koji Jurakovoj firmi daje veliki kredit za preuzimanje malotrgovinskog lanca. On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo. Max Lovrek oženjen je Vesnom Lovrek (Barbara Vicković), ženom sumnjivog karaktera, koja je pritom Maksu neverna. Bankar Lovrek iz prvog braka ima sina Svena (Sven Madžarević), 2o godišnjaka, prilično povučenog, skromnog dečka. Maks kuje zaveru protiv Juraka s Jurakovim ambicioznim sinom Ivanom. Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju. Ima i razloga za slepilo: voli Jurakovu ćerku, Doru. Njihovu vezu Tomislav Jurak nikad ne bi dopustio...</desc>

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je ljubav dvoje mladih, fudbalera Marka Marušića i slikarke Nine Radić. Njihova ljubavna priča je puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju.

    <title lang="hr">Pare ili život</title>
    <desc lang="hr">"Pare ili život" prati glavne likove iz istoimene serije i njihovu nezaboravnu ljetnju avanturu u najljepšim predelima crnogorskog Primorja. "Pare ili život" je dramska, komična TV serija koja prati nekoliko različitih karaktera u sudaru s našom svakodnevnicom. Dramski realizam ove serije nekad se graniči s apsurdom, ali oslobođen je humora po svaku cenu i radije problematizuje neke socijalne fenomene. U društvu koje priželjkuje da je tranzicija već gotova, a ona tek što je počela, javljaju se brojne zamke za sve one koji se "nisu snašli". A Miki, Džoni, Višnja, Sunčica, Marun, Maja i Časlav, nisu sposobni da u novim okolnostima uspeju poput oca njihovog prijatelja Gagija. Razlozi za to nisu ni vaspitanje, ni "devedesete", ni komunizam (pa toliki zakleti komunisti veoma lako su postali uspešni kapitalisti). Na putu do uspeha smetaju im veliko srce i slab stomak. Svi njihovi poduhvati tužni su do smeha, jer je svako raspet između prevaziđenog osećanja zajedništva i želje za ličnim uspehom. Ipak, kad se u njihovim životima pojavi raspevani sanjar Džoni, počinje da se stvara jedna čudna porodica gde svi oni, hteli to ili ne, ostvaruju mnogo jače veze od onih rodbinskih. I usput dobijaju možda mnogo vredniju nagradu od one za kojom sve vreme jure.</desc>

Tomislav Jurak (Žarko Radić) je pedesetogodišnjak, vodi porodični biznis koji uključuje lanac restorana i hotel u centru grada, koji je počeo da gradi još u vreme socijalizma, ali ga je u vlasništvo preuzeo tokom privatizacije devedesetih novcem svoje tete Mitzy. Njegova žena Ana Jurak (Ksenija Pajić), u ranim četrdesetim, rodila mu je dvoje dece- Ivana i Doru. Ana je napustila studije prava kad ga je upoznala i posvetila se brizi o porodici i uz pomoć kućne pomoćnice, brizi o samoj sebi-shopping, bazen i tračanje, omiljene su joj obaveze. Kako god bilo, ona je u svakom slučaju temelj familije. Ćerka Dora (Jelena Veljača) ima 20 godina i studira ekonomiju. Otac je obožava i ne prihvata činjenicu da je već odavno došla u godine da ima dečka i svoju intimu. Razmažena tatina kćer. Ivan (Mislav Čavajda) radi s ocem u firmi. Zgodan zagrebački dečko, dvadesetpetogodišnjak, ali neodgovoran, sklon porocima, ukratko, loš karakter lepog lica.

On i Tomislav Jurak (ne)prijatelji su još od falultetskih dana. Uz posao, Jurakovi i Lovrekovi povezani su i privatno, a razdoblje prividnog prijateljstva s početka priče ubrzo prerasta u suparništvo.

Treća glavna ekipa su bolesna majka Dunja (Nada Gačešić Livaković) i njen sin Luka (Damir Markovina), pametan i obrazovan mladić koji neumorno radi kod Jurakovih, ali ne razume da ga oni iskorištavaju.

U središtu priče su dve generacije triju porodica povezanih fudbalom. Serija prati živote četvorice mladića iz predgrađa koji su odrasli uz fudbal. Dvojica od njih napravili su profesionalne karijere kao fudbaleri, jedan je postao uspešan trener, a poslednji je u menadžerskim vodama. U mladosti, na vrhuncu karijere, jedan od mladića tragično je izgubio život, nakon čega su ostale životni putevi odveli na različite strane.Serija počinje dvadeset pet godina kasnije kad su svi ponovo u Zagrebu. Osim što ih veže fudbal i zajednička prošlost, likovi serije su i u složenim emotivnim odnosima. Paralelno se prate i životi njihove dece, koji su odrastali pod uticajem fudbala, te su često opterećeni prošlošću svojih roditelja. U središtu je ljubav dvoje mladih, fudbalera Marka Marušića i slikarke Nine Radić. Njihova ljubavna priča je puna prepreka i zapleta zbog različitih sredina i naizgled nespojivih životnih stilova.</desc>

"Pare ili život" je dramska, komična TV serija koja prati nekoliko različitih karaktera u sudaru s našom svakodnevnicom. Dramski realizam ove serije nekad se graniči s apsurdom, ali oslobođen je humora po svaku cenu i radije problematizuje neke socijalne fenomene. U društvu koje priželjkuje da je tranzicija već gotova, a ona tek što je počela, javljaju se brojne zamke za sve one koji se "nisu snašli". A Miki, Džoni, Višnja, Sunčica, Marun, Maja i Časlav, nisu sposobni da u novim okolnostima uspeju poput oca njihovog prijatelja Gagija. Razlozi za to nisu ni vaspitanje, ni "devedesete", ni komunizam (pa toliki zakleti komunisti veoma lako su postali uspešni kapitalisti). Na putu do uspeha smetaju im veliko srce i slab stomak. Svi njihovi poduhvati tužni su do smeha, jer je svako raspet između prevaziđenog osećanja zajedništva i želje za ličnim uspehom. Ipak, kad se u njihovim životima pojavi raspevani sanjar Džoni, počinje da se stvara jedna čudna porodica gde svi oni, hteli to ili ne, ostvaruju mnogo jače veze od onih rodbinskih.

Deda mu je rekao da svaki uspešan Srbin mora da ima kafanu i on je ove godine osnovao svoju.

Serija "M(j)ešoviti brak" snimljena je na osnovu istoimene pozorišne predstave koja spada među najgledanije poslednjih godina. Naravno, dodati su novi likovi, proširena je priča, a gastarbajterska porodica Čađenovic vratila se u novu državu, Srbiju i Crnu Goru. Čuli su za promene, pa su odlučili da posle više godina boravka u Lucernu, u Švajcarskoj, teško zarađene devize ulože u bisnis u Beogradu. Sasvim slucajno, prvi kadrovi ove serije snimljeni su u državi koja se zvala Jugoslavija, a prva epizoda završena je u državi, koja se poput ovog mešovitog braka Crnogorca i Srpkinje, zove Srbija i Crna Gora.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Pare ili život</title>
    <desc lang="hr">"Pare ili život" prati glavne likove iz istoimene serije i njihovu nezaboravnu ljetnju avanturu u najljepšim predelima crnogorskog Primorja. "Pare ili život" je dramska, komična TV serija koja prati nekoliko različitih karaktera u sudaru s našom svakodnevnicom. Dramski realizam ove serije nekad se graniči s apsurdom, ali oslobođen je humora po svaku cenu i radije problematizuje neke socijalne fenomene. U društvu koje priželjkuje da je tranzicija već gotova, a ona tek što je počela, javljaju se brojne zamke za sve one koji se "nisu snašli". A Miki, Džoni, Višnja, Sunčica, Marun, Maja i Časlav, nisu sposobni da u novim okolnostima uspeju poput oca njihovog prijatelja Gagija. Razlozi za to nisu ni vaspitanje, ni "devedesete", ni komunizam (pa toliki zakleti komunisti veoma lako su postali uspešni kapitalisti). Na putu do uspeha smetaju im veliko srce i slab stomak. Svi njihovi poduhvati tužni su do smeha, jer je svako raspet između prevaziđenog osećanja zajedništva i želje za ličnim uspehom. Ipak, kad se u njihovim životima pojavi raspevani sanjar Džoni, počinje da se stvara jedna čudna porodica gde svi oni, hteli to ili ne, ostvaruju mnogo jače veze od onih rodbinskih. I usput dobijaju možda mnogo vredniju nagradu od one za kojom sve vreme jure.</desc>

The implausibility of Ice Age keeps on degrading as we caper towards exploring new parts of the franchise. Maybe Blue Sky Studios have been milking its installments too much, so much that they are actually running out of material.

It tried to give the story a perspective and a good direction. Granny returns once again with her incessant nagging which never bores you. Oh and we should never forget the true antihero of Ice Age franchise, Scrat who always brings hilarity to no matter what he does.\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT \n\nI say the humour is way better than what the Angry Birds movie came up with.

If you didn't, well, you are still going to like Ice Age Collision Course for its magnificent animation and rib-tickling humour.\n\nRead all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":59677,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. Now let me say Wow this movie was bad. I mean I thought this kind of clumsy, lowest common denominator filmmaking died in the 80's. It is bad when I asked the organizer to give me a refund on a free prescreening.\n\nWhere to begin? I don't expect much in this type of movie in terms of plot or characterization. In action "porn" like this, the plot is usually just barely coherent enough to move from one action sequence to the next and the characters are as black and white as a chessboard. This movie somehow delivers LESS than that.\n\nIt is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time.\n\nWhat really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. WTF? It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. \n\nOddly enough, the blood and gore in this film is kept to a minimum, probably to keep it at PG-13 in hopes of duping the largest possible audience to drop money on it. It would have really benefited from a Conan-esque level of violence to give the movie more weight and better directed action sequences. The dramatic pause in the middle of the action (made famous in the movie 300) is in every single action sequence. \n\nI really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53056,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. Now let me say Wow this movie was bad. I mean I thought this kind of clumsy, lowest common denominator filmmaking died in the 80's. It is bad when I asked the organizer to give me a refund on a free prescreening.\n\nWhere to begin? I don't expect much in this type of movie in terms of plot or characterization. In action "porn" like this, the plot is usually just barely coherent enough to move from one action sequence to the next and the characters are as black and white as a chessboard. This movie somehow delivers LESS than that.\n\nIt is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time.\n\nWhat really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. WTF? It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. \n\nOddly enough, the blood and gore in this film is kept to a minimum, probably to keep it at PG-13 in hopes of duping the largest possible audience to drop money on it. It would have really benefited from a Conan-esque level of violence to give the movie more weight and better directed action sequences. The dramatic pause in the middle of the action (made famous in the movie 300) is in every single action sequence. \n\nI really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53056,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Šarmer je koji zna slušati i brinuti se o svojim ljudima. No, Stanton ima i mnoštvo "prljavog rublja" koje treba sakriti, zbog Stantonove poznate slabosti prema ženama. Njegova supruga Susan (E.

Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds.\n\nLike its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country.\n\nNow this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner.\n\nAnd if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience.\n\nIn closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85907,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds.\n\nLike its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country.\n\nNow this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner.\n\nAnd if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience.\n\nIn closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85907,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner.\n\nAnd if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience.\n\nIn closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85907,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie follows his attempts to avoid both the army and marriage in a matter of week, eventually failing in both. He usually drives around in his Zastava 750, sits at caffe's and takes no significant responsibilities. With a synopsis like this, the first film that comes to my mind is "Once Upon a Time There Was a Singing Blackbird", but this has much more comic input than Iosseliani's movie. Goran Markovic's masterpiece is one of the most beloved Serbian films of all time. It's more than a successful comedy. The highest points are magnificent and clever dialogue, as well as the elaboration and variety of characters, one funnier after another. If you're looking for an empty eye-candy that is likely to win any of the festival nowadays, skip this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3354,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie follows his attempts to avoid both the army and marriage in a matter of week, eventually failing in both. He usually drives around in his Zastava 750, sits at caffe's and takes no significant responsibilities. With a synopsis like this, the first film that comes to my mind is "Once Upon a Time There Was a Singing Blackbird", but this has much more comic input than Iosseliani's movie. Goran Markovic's masterpiece is one of the most beloved Serbian films of all time. It's more than a successful comedy. The highest points are magnificent and clever dialogue, as well as the elaboration and variety of characters, one funnier after another. If you're looking for an empty eye-candy that is likely to win any of the festival nowadays, skip this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3354,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Boško Buha</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Bosko Buha: Directed by Branko Bauer. With Marko Nikolic, Zarko Radic, Ljubisa Samardzic, Miroljub Leso.

It's a crime story, around the main character, trying to discover who he is, trying to understand what happened to the family he doesn't remember. It's well paced, even though is nothing fully original, these gimmicks were already made. But it is quite intense and powerful, and the main character is very well built.\n\nIt's a story every thriller fan around the world will enjoy for sure, just don't expect to finish with an awesome mood.

However, the material he was given to work with was not as good as Silence of the Lambs.  In fairness, perhaps there was no way it could be.  In SOTL, he was somehow more foreboding, more of a sort of superhuman monster; in Hannibal, he's more accessible, a guy you meet on the street.

Still, it had no other major flaws, so it gets a 6 of 10.\n\nNow, there's another category I'll call the shock factor.  It's different than ordinary gore, it's... creative gore.  The sick, disgusting depravity we expect to see and like to see in this type of film.  I can't go into detail without spoiling it, but I'll have to say it goes even beyond what I expected.  Do not watch this film if you are squeamish or dislike gore. There isn't a lot of gore in the film, but what there was, was... concentrated.

As a refreshing change to more formulaic chillers, WLB takes its time to build the suspense. It is allowed to do this by virtue of Harrison Ford, and, especially, Michelle Pfeiffer, who, I feel, deserved an Oscar nomination for her convincing portrayal of a happy, but suddenly lonely, wife. It is just about as Hitchcockian as you can get, and I rate the bath sequence as gripping (pardon the pun) as taking a shower at the Bates Motel. The plot is thin and the action is played out sedately. Yet it seems perfectly timed in setting the mood of the whole piece. I particularly liked the music,and the supporting actress Diana Scarwid, whose lighthearted attitude during the seance scene made it all the more chilling. A perfect example of good film-making with only a slight plot. I am sure this movie will mature with age until it is rightfully regarded as a modern classic.

As a refreshing change to more formulaic chillers, WLB takes its time to build the suspense. It is allowed to do this by virtue of Harrison Ford, and, especially, Michelle Pfeiffer, who, I feel, deserved an Oscar nomination for her convincing portrayal of a happy, but suddenly lonely, wife. It is just about as Hitchcockian as you can get, and I rate the bath sequence as gripping (pardon the pun) as taking a shower at the Bates Motel. The plot is thin and the action is played out sedately. Yet it seems perfectly timed in setting the mood of the whole piece. I particularly liked the music,and the supporting actress Diana Scarwid, whose lighthearted attitude during the seance scene made it all the more chilling. A perfect example of good film-making with only a slight plot. I am sure this movie will mature with age until it is rightfully regarded as a modern classic. Count the number of times you jump!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120225,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is about a psychologist, David Callaway (Robert DeNiro) whose wife commits suicide, and he decides to move to upstate New York with his daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), whose personality has severely changed after her mother's death. A family friend/psychologist/co-worker of David, Katherine (Famke Janssen) disagrees with David's decision to move, and thinks that Emily should stay where she is. Then after David and Emily move into their new house, David meets Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue), who becomes a friend to David and Emily. Then strange things begin to happen - Emily discovers a new imaginary friend, Charlie. And then people start to die. \n\nRobert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning are both brilliant, their performances were extremely real and convincing. Dakota is quite talented for her age, and DeNiro gives another great performance like he always does. Famke Janssen ("Don't Say A Word" and "House on Haunted Hill") also does great, and Elisabeth Shue ("The Karate Kid") is also very good. In fact, the whole cast was great. The whole film was really suspenseful, and it tricks you a lot. The atmosphere was heavy, I loved the whole feeling of the secluded upstate New York small-town, and the large house David and Emily move into. \n\nI liked this movie because it was more psychological rather than chop and slash gore that most horror films use to scare people. "Hide and Seek" has a good, solid story behind it, which is why it is such a good horror film, and the acting is top notch on top of it all. I don't understand everyone's problem with this movie, it was actually quite good. Sure, the ending is a little cliché, but the rest of the movie was good enough on it's own. 8/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82572,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A dog eat dog society fueled by greed, materialistic possessions, excess and drugs. People preying on others, a world of unscrupulous inside trading and the rise of yuppies. Oliver Stone is one of those film makers who knew the 80's inside out. People say John Hughes defined the 80's but Mr. Stone showed it's true side and it was ugly. \n\nThe film follows a low level day trader (Charlie Sheen) who strives to become a very powerful figure on Wall Street like his idol Gordon Geckko (Michael Douglas). To justify his rise to power, he uses his father (Martin Sheen) knowledge of the flight industry for his own personnel gains. He wants to get his foot into the door of the oily Geckko. Will he sell his soul for a quick buck? How far and fast will this rising star soar? To find these answers check out Wall Street.\n\nThis film was made immediately after Platoon. Stone made it clear that he wasn't going to let an Oscar winning malaise effect him. He explores the two fathers theme that he used in Platton and once again makes it work. A highly underrated film that has sadly been neglected by the mainstream audience. What makes it even sadder is the fact that it still applies today.\n\nHighly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":146688,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ljubavna, ali i snažna istorijska priča koja se tiče svih nas, smeštena je u period od avgusta 1913, nakon pobede Srbije u Balkanskim ratovima kada je povratila deo teoritorije, do kraja 1915. godine, kada je austrougarska vojska okupirala Beograd. Glavni junak, mladi srpski oficir, vraća se sa ratišta u rodnu kuću. Svadba mu je, tradicionalno, već zakazana, ali zaplet priče počinje kada ćerka austrougarskog poslanika, koju igra Ivana Dudić, "baci oko" na njega. Nedopustivo za to vreme, koketna mlada dama, ne krije svoja osećanja. Rasplet njihove ljubavne drame (koja je plod mašte autora) odvija se u realnom istorijskom periodu pred Veliki rat, pa se u scenariju pojavljuje još dvadesetak glavnih likova, uglavnom stvarnih istorijskih ličnosti. Biće tu dramatičnih događanja, špijunskih intriga, diplomatskih nadmudrivanja, političkih spletki i prevara...</desc>

His wife, Lori (Sharon Stone) isn't so keen on it--she'd prefer a trip to Saturn, or a space cruise. Riding on the subway one day, Quaid notices a television advertisement for a company named Rekall, which specializes in memory implants of vacations. Quaid checks into it as an alternate means of having a "Mars vacation". While at Rekall, he chooses an alternate personality upgrade of a secret agent. However, while undergoing the procedure, something goes wrong. He learns that his Quaid identity was a memory implant and he really _is_ a secret agent. Now that he has his real memory back, he's on the run and he escapes to Mars. But why is everyone after him? \n\nTotal Recall, based on "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale", a short story from 1974 by Philip K. Dick (and novelized in conjunction with the film production by Piers Anthony), had a laborious history getting to the silver screen. Tens of drafts were written. Production companies were attached then went out of business. Many directors and stars were attached who either changed their minds or who were dropped. Luckily, Arnold Schwarzenegger talked Carolco into picking up the project for him, with Paul Verhoeven--who'd already proved his mettle on the similarly toned RoboCop (1987)--on board as director, because this is an excellent film.\n\nWhile Total Recall certainly has influences, including "The Martian Chronicles" (1980), Dune (1984) and the first major film based on a Philip K. Dick work, Blade Runner (1982), it's more notable for the films that it has influenced in subsequent years, including The Fifth Element (1997) and many of the "rubber reality" films such as Abre los ojos (1997)/Vanilla Sky (2001) and The Thirteenth Floor (1999). It's also yet another film on the very long list that have had various elements "adapted" into part of The Matrix (1999)--most explicitly here, the "bug" that Quaid has to remove from his body with a high-tech machine and the possibility of "waking up" from a particular reality by taking "the red pill".\n\nAlthough it's easy to interpret Total Recall in a very straightforward manner, so that the bulk of what we're seeing at any particular moment and the bulk of the dialogue are the literal reality, very convincing arguments can be made that the majority of the film is a depiction of Quaid's memory implant while in the "patient's chair" at Rekall. And those certainly aren't the only two interpretations possible.\n\nWhat matters more than thinking one has a "right answer", though, is the deeply captivating story that provokes our interpretations and the amount of fun we have getting there. Verhoeven and the scriptwriting team, which included Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, the writing team behind the Alien films (beginning with Alien, 1979), never let us go very long without another plot twist, most of which force a reinterpretation of the material that went before. The twists occur about once per every ten minutes, if not more frequently.\n\nThe film is notable for its special effects by Rob Bottin, which were far ahead of their time, and its fantastic production and art design, which manage to make us feel both that we're experiencing a vicarious trip to a "future grunge" Mars and an almost "Doctor Who" (1963)-ish absurdly artificial reality, complete with supersaturated red skies, ala Frank R. Paul's illustrated covers for the Amazing Stories fiction magazine.\n\nSome locations in Mexico were used for the film, including some subway shots on Mars, and actual commercial sign age was incorporated into the film. There's a lot of fun to be had noticing all of the cultural differences and similarities that the future era of the film will bring. Verhoeven delights in subtle glimpses of various symbols and accoutrement's. His view of the future is one full of corruption, commercialism and decadence. He doesn't have much confidence in a "bright new world" as humans spread out to new territory.\n\nVerhoeven is basically extending the way things are now to the future; it's as if he sees our state as indicative of human nature, so that as long as we're humans, people are going to be taking advantage of one another, trying to control one another, engaging in behavior that's a conflict between desires and societal mores, but also helping out each other when the going gets tough. In these respects, Total Recall has culture-satirical similarities to later films such as Starship Troopers (1997), which isn't surprising given that Verhoeven directed both films. It's notable that Total Recall's future is not quite as bleak as Starship Trooper's.\n\nBut the film is hardly less violent. Verhoeven's initial cut was given an X by the MPAA for violence. A number of scenes had to have small edits, most of which have thankfully been restored on at least one special edition DVD. The violence here is a lot more small scale and personal than Starship Troopers. In terms of the visceral, Total Recall often rides a gray area somewhere between action and horror. While the action isn't as explosive as many Schwarzenegger films, the suspense never resolves until the end. This is an amazing thrill ride of a film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":310398,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Three kids travel through a picture to the land of Narnia and learn of their destiny to free it and help Prince Caspian . Lucy (George Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace (Will Poucher) where they meet up with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader . Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarfs, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world . Then, all of them go throughout the fantastic world and where animals speaking as a likable giant swords-rat , a bull and many others . It has been foretold that they will bring peace to Narnia with the guidance of the mystical lion . They must survive the evil treachery of the mysterious White Witch (Tilda Swinton) who still claims to be Queen . They team up with Aslem (Liam Neeson), the mighty Lion , fighting to defeat the evil in an epic finale battle against a huge sea monster .\n\nIn this impressive production , C.S. Lewis' imagination is brought to life with top-notch computer generator special effects . It packs amazing fantasy , breathtaking adventures and overwhelming sea battles . This enjoyable story is lavishly produced by Andrew Adamson from ¨Shrek trilogy¨ and Mark Johnson . The pic is a magic story with rip-snorting adventures , exciting fantasy , state-of-art FX , sensational scenarios and good feeling . Plenty of action and emotion with incredible sea battle scenes and really influenced by ¨Pirates of Caribbean¨ . Provide enough amusement to keep the hands on your seat and dazzling eyes until the epic ending . In spite of overlong runtime and the difficult of adapting , the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the fantastic saga . Sympathetic performances for all casting with special mention to Will Poucher who steals the show as a grumpy kid turned into incredible hero . The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Dante Spinotti . Musical score fitting perfectly to action-adventure by David Arnold . The motion picture is marvelously directed by Michael Apted , he's director, producer of several successes such as ¨The word is not enough¨, ¨Gorillas in the mist¨ , ¨Class action¨, ¨Nell¨, ¨Enigma¨ , among others . Rating : Above average and worthwhile seeing , the whole family will enjoy this film . It's a very likable adventure-fantasy and enormously appealing for kids, adolescents and young men . Overall this is a really nice movie . If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with overwhelming CGI animation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145267,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not because I think she's a great actress - she's done nothing to prove this - but because... well, it's Megan Fox. The only reason why she was "discovered" by Michael Bay and put in the Transformers movies was because she's hot, and that's precisely the only reason why she was given her first starring role with Jennifer's Body. Because, really, although she isn't particularly awful - I've seen worst performances in porn movies - her performing skills don't deserve as much attention as she has been receiving. Yes, that basically means she doesn't give a very good performance in Jennifer's Body. And to be honest, that's something of a disappointment - before watching the movie, I had a little bit of hope that the reason why Fox had given such horrible performances in the Transformers movies was Michael Bay's inability to direct actors. After watching this movie, though, I concluded that Fox is nothing more than eye candy - whether she's directed by Bay or Martin Scorsese, she'll always give a bad performance.\n\nThe film tells the story of teenager Needy (Amanda Seyfried), whose best friend is the ridiculously hot Jennifer (Megan Fox). The former has a somehow timid but likable boyfriend, Chip (Johnny Simmons) while the latter loves the fact that she can sleep with whoever she wants whenever she wants. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a bar to watch the semi-popular rock band Low Shoulder. The lead singer (Adam Brody) gives Needy the creeps but Jennifer likes him. After the show is abruptly ended by a fire, the group takes her to their van and they disappear... Needy fears the worst. Next day, though, Jennifer appears to be all right. It turns out that, instead of dying a pretty horrible death, she was turned into a demon who has to eat boys in order to maintain her hotness.\n\nI understand what Diablo Cody (screenwritter of the fabulous Juno) tried to do. Instead of crafting a straight-forward horror story, she tried to write something a little more humorous and a little more quirky, but the problem with this approach is that the movie doesn't really know what it wants to do. At times, it can be hilarious - because the filmmakers are providing with a joke or gag or some weird-ish, quirky line -, while at others it can be unintentionally - and awfully - funny. And when it tries to be scary, it utterly - and somehow embarrassingly - fails. You'd have to be either a very small boy or girl or a very frightful person in order to be scared by the movie.\n\nAlthough the aforementioned Fox is not very convincing as Jennifer - okay, that's unfair; she is convincing when portraying the mega-hot high-school girl because she's basically playing herself; it's when she turns into a boy-eating monster that things become laughable -, the rest of the cast are pretty much all right. Because Amanda Seyfried - who was delightful in the underrated Mamma Mia - can act, Fox's performance seems even more artificial than it already is. What's more - Needy is virtually the only believable character in the whole movie, which is a blessing considering she's the main one. Johnny Simmons is also very likable as Chip - his eventual fate was the only scene in the film that got me emotionally involved with what was happening on screen - and a very small supporting performance by J.K. Simmons - as a school teacher - is as memorable as things get in this film.\n\nThose who want to watch the movie to catch a glimpse of a naked Megan Fox are definitely going to be disappointed. Although there's plenty of gore, guts and language, Fox never gets naked. During a weird skinny dipping scene, her nude body is hidden from view by tricky camera angles and other techniques, and the only really sexual scene in which she gets involved - not even Fox can make cannibalism hot - is a lesbian kissing sequence with Seyfried. Can't say it's not a hot scene - because it is - but it somehow seemed tame for today's standards. Really, though, these are only very small problems which I could have forgiven had the film worked as a horror flick - the main problem with Jennifer's Body is that it's neither scary nor laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nHaving seen and appreciated Juno, I was expecting more from screen writer Diablo Cody. This is a case of a very successful - and from what I gathered from her previous movie, talented - screen writer trying to do something different and failing. Yes, her intentions were really noble, but the end result - being, in this case, a motion picture - is nothing short of a disaster. While Amanda Seyfried tries to give her best - unlike Fox, she doesn't embarrass herself -, the rest of the production is so mediocre I can't believe someone thought it was worth releasing in theatres. If Jennifer's Body was a way to prove that Diablo Cody could write a successful horror film, it failed. And if it was to prove that Megan Fox was something more than eye candy, then it also failed. And really, Fox isn't that hot either. For my money, Seyfried is a million times prettier, and she has the advantage that, unlike Fox, she can act."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120904,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels.

And there's nothing wrong with creating a fictional story based on myths and legends. But when you say Beijing is in Alaska, and the Chinese character in the movie sounds French, there's no way you can sell this cringeworthy, embarassing movie to an audience, who thankfully has access to internet and can look up for the facts.\n\nIt's said that the year is 1442, but the real Vlad the Impaler was 11 years old at that time. And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels. We don't have a dime to pay for a two hour long idiocracy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Seinfeld</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Serija "Seinfeld" opravdano se etablirala kao jedna od najuspješnijih i najpopularnijih humorističnih serija u povijesti televizije. Takozvana "serija o ničemu" uspjela je redefinirati žanr humorističnih serija gotovo preko noći. "Seinfeld" je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emmyja, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj malen u usporedbi s višemilijunskim auditorijem koji je svakog tjedna sjedao pred TV kako bi vidio što Njemu večeras smeta. Iza imena serije koja je počela kao svaki drugi sitcom, a izrasla u najkompleksnije televizijsko remek djelo krije se prezime jednog stand up komičara - Jerryja Seinfelda. Neurotičan lik kojeg je Jerry Seinfeld stvorio, ili je možda takav i u stvarnosti, izrodio je zvijezdu iz svakog lika samca koji se pojavio u nekom odnosu s njim. Jerry, George, Elaine i Kramer glavni su protagonisti "serije o ničemu". Rasprava hoće li Jerryjev noćni posjet postati nova romantična avantura, pljačka Jerryjevog stana, izbjegavanje susreta sa starim prijateljima do trgovine dionicama tek su neke od tema koje će zabaviti gledatelje u prvoj sezoni Seinfelda.</desc>

Movie goers tend to fall into one of two groups when it comes to Johnny Depp – big fans or denigrators. Whichever side of the line you fall, there are few actors who can claim such a diverse career of on screen characters ranging from Edward Scissorhands to Gilbert Grape; from Donnie Brasco to Captain Jack Sparrow; from Willy Wonka to Sweeney Todd; and from John Dillinger to Tonto. Depp now turns his talents towards one of the most unsympathetic real life characters imaginable   South Boston's infamous crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger.\n\nDirector Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) proves yet again that he is an actor's director, rather than a visual technician or story addict. In this adaptation of the book from "Boston Globe" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, Cooper has Depp and Joel Edgerton as his two leads, and an incredibly deep supporting cast that provide the look and feel for this period piece dramatizing the crime and corruption during Bulger's reign.\n\nWhen one thinks of the memorable kingpins of crime/gangster movies, those that come to mind include Michael Corleone (The Godfather movies), Tony Montana (Scarface), Jimmy Conway (Goodfellas), and Frank Costello (The Departed). The Costello character was supposedly partially inspired by Bulger. What made each of these characters fascinating to watch was the insight we were given into the psychological make-up of each and the inner-workings of their organization. And that's the disappointment of Cooper's film.\n\nFor the Whitey Bulger story, there are two distinct directions to explore: the building of Bulger's criminal empire, or the motivation of the FBI Agent John Connolly (Edgerton) as he juggled his job and relationship with Bulger. Unfortunately, the approach here is to show a hand full of cold-blooded murders to prove Bulger's management style, and a few FBI meetings that show the obvious uncertainty within the agency. Rather than a muddled mash-up, a more interesting movie would have chosen a path and dug in deeply.\n\nDespite the story issues, it is fun to watch how Depp and Edgerton tackle their roles. Under heavy make-up (wrinkles, receding hairline, hillbilly teeth, and crazy contact lenses), Depp becomes the intimidating force of Whitey Bulger. Just as impressive is Edgerton as Agent Connolly, as we witness the Southie neighborhood boys all grown up, but still playing cops and robbers   and it remains difficult to tell who the good guys from the bad. Edgerton's cockiness and strutting capture the ego and ambition necessary for a federal agent to bend so many rules. In fact, despite the vastly different approaches, it's not entirely clear which of these two fellows possesses the greatest ambition.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother who became a State Senator. We get very few scenes featuring the brothers, and in fact, Cumberbath's best scenes are instead shared with Edgerton. It's difficult not to chuckle at their first meeting in a restaurant as we watch a Brit and Aussie talk it out with south Boston accents. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott play Edgerton's fellow FBI agents, while Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane (especially good) and W Earl Brown make terrific Bulger crew members. Peter Sarsgaard leaves quite the impression as a doped-up associate, while Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple provide the film's minimal female presence. Corey Stoll storms onto the screen as a Federal Prosecutor who is not amused by the relationship between Connolly and Bulger, but this movie belongs to Depp and Edgerton.\n\nThe concern is that any viewer not already familiar with the Whitey Bulger story may find the story not overly interesting, despite the terrific performances. Fortunately, this viewer was mesmerized by last year's exceptional documentary entitled Whitey: United States of America v James J Bulger   a must see for anyone who wants full details into the Bulger reign of crime and terror, as well as his 20 years on the lam.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170539,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Brooklyn 99</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Zakon i nered. U njujorškoj policijskoj postaji u Brooklynu svaki dan je poseban, svaki je drugačiji i u pravilu prilično kaotičan. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) talentirani je detektiv, zbog čega se nikad nije morao ubijati od posla i slijepo se držati pravila. Budući da je uhitio više zločinaca od kolega, tijekom karijere svi su ga držali kao kap vode na dlanu. Sve dok u postaju nije došao novi zapovjednik, kapetan Ray Holt (Andre Braugher). Kapetan Holt poštuje pravila i propise, koje su detektivi 99. postaje dugo zanemarivali. Jakeovi kolege vrsni su i sposobni detektivi, ali kronično im nedostaje reda i discipline. Međusobno se nadmeću, idu si na živce, tračaju i flertaju, ali u konačnici jedni druge štite. Detektivka Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), dežurna čistunka u postaji, oduševljena je novim vodstvom. Budući da je odrasla sa sedmoricom braće, voli se nadmetati u svakom smislu te riječi. Silno želi uhititi više zločinaca od Jakea i svjesna je koliko se mora potruditi da bi u tome uspjela. Holtov zamjenik, narednik Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), stijena je od čovjeka, no povukao se u ured nakon što mu je žena rodila blizanke Cagney i Lacey, i to zbog silnoga straha da u suprotnome neće vidjeti kako mu kćeri odrastaju. U 99. postaji radi i detektiv Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), kojem je Jake idol. Charles je izrazito vrijedan - niti je genijalac niti je snažan, jednostavno se trudi više od drugih. Jako mu se sviđa bahata, opaka i seksi detektivka Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), ali on kod nje nema ama baš nikakve šanse. A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Goldbergovi</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Jednom ne tako davno i ne tako daleko 11-godišnji Adam Goldberg (Sean Giambrone) video-kamerom svojih roditelja dokumentira život na periferiji 1980-ih godina. Pratimo 3. sezonu humoristične serije za sve uzraste o bučnoj, toploj i pomalo neprilagođenoj obitelji u 80-ima. Pripovjedač nam govori o svojem životu s nametljivom majkom, razdražljivim ocem, buntovnom starijom sestrom, prenapetim starijim bratom i djedom zavodnikom. Goldbergovi su obožavatelji videorekordera, glazbenih kompilacija i elastana! Najmlađi sin Adam (Sean Giambrone), štreber opsjednut filmovima, i dalje se pokušava nositi sa životom školarca te dokumentira urnebesne i neugodne ispade svoje živopisne obitelji. Majka Beverly (Wendi McLendon-Covey) u punoj je formi kad se petlja u tuđe živote, nalazi ljudima partnere i zasljepljuje sve oko sebe, dok tata Murray (Jeff Garlin) odgaja djecu iz udobnog naslonjača na kojem sjedi samo u gaćama. Najstarije dijete Erica (Hayley Orrantia) napokon će se odvojiti od obitelji i otići na fakultet. Barry (Troy Gentile), srednje dijete, obuzet je osjećajima, kao i pisanjem domišljatih stihova te suosjeća s prijateljem Geoffom Schwartzom (Sam Lerner) kad njihove starije djevojke odu studirati. Najstariji je član obitelji omiljeni djed Al Solomon (George Segal), razuzdani član klana, besramni zavodnik koji uživa u trenucima s unucima gotovo jednako kao i u tjednim masažama. U ovoj sezoni djeca će se morati odupirati zagrljajima i pusicama dok pokušavaju odrasti u obitelji Goldberg.</desc>

A u policijske posle nos neprestano zabada ekscentrična i umišljena tajnica Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti).</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Goldbergovi</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Jednom ne tako davno i ne tako daleko 11-godišnji Adam Goldberg (Sean Giambrone) video-kamerom svojih roditelja dokumentira život na periferiji 1980-ih godina. Pratimo 3. sezonu humoristične serije za sve uzraste o bučnoj, toploj i pomalo neprilagođenoj obitelji u 80-ima. Pripovjedač nam govori o svojem životu s nametljivom majkom, razdražljivim ocem, buntovnom starijom sestrom, prenapetim starijim bratom i djedom zavodnikom. Goldbergovi su obožavatelji videorekordera, glazbenih kompilacija i elastana! Najmlađi sin Adam (Sean Giambrone), štreber opsjednut filmovima, i dalje se pokušava nositi sa životom školarca te dokumentira urnebesne i neugodne ispade svoje živopisne obitelji. Majka Beverly (Wendi McLendon-Covey) u punoj je formi kad se petlja u tuđe živote, nalazi ljudima partnere i zasljepljuje sve oko sebe, dok tata Murray (Jeff Garlin) odgaja djecu iz udobnog naslonjača na kojem sjedi samo u gaćama. Najstarije dijete Erica (Hayley Orrantia) napokon će se odvojiti od obitelji i otići na fakultet. Barry (Troy Gentile), srednje dijete, obuzet je osjećajima, kao i pisanjem domišljatih stihova te suosjeća s prijateljem Geoffom Schwartzom (Sam Lerner) kad njihove starije djevojke odu studirati. Najstariji je član obitelji omiljeni djed Al Solomon (George Segal), razuzdani član klana, besramni zavodnik koji uživa u trenucima s unucima gotovo jednako kao i u tjednim masažama. U ovoj sezoni djeca će se morati odupirati zagrljajima i pusicama dok pokušavaju odrasti u obitelji Goldberg.</desc>

Sajnfeld je kultni naslov iza kojeg stoji devet Emija, tri Zlatna globusa i pregršt drugih nagrada, čiji je broj mali u odnosu na višemilionski auditorijum koji je svake nedelje sedeo pred televizijskih ekrana kako bi video šta to njemu večeras na tako smešan i komičan način, smeta. Džeri je komičar koji ima najboljeg prijatelja, bivšu devojku koja mu postaje najbolja prijateljica i komšiju koji mu postaje deo života. Itekako mu ide sa ženama, ali nijedna mu ne odgovara: ili ima veliki nos, ili je prelepa, ali ne baš pod svakim svetlom itd...ali vremenom mu sve to postaje dosadno i odluči da menja svoj život.</desc>
