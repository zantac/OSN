It is all done with clever subtlety.\n\nBob Balaban and Robert Altmann story idea combined with Fellowes's eloquent writing is first rate. The dialogues are filled with wit, humour and subtle depth. The mansion itself plays a key character in the story but it is the spellbinding cinematography that functions as the mansion's eyes.

Grant, a pulling-it-together Derek Jacobi, a frightened Alan Bates, a grumpy Eileen Atkins and an adorable Kelly Macdonald. 'Gosford Park' has one of the best ensemble cast.\n\nI also loved the soundtrack. It is never overdone. The jazzy tracks contribute well in setting the atmosphere and there are some wonderful songs performed by Jeremy Northam's character.\n\nIn the beginning, it is a little difficult to keep up with the names of the characters which leads to a bit of confusion but with a little bit of patience, once you're over that, it becomes easy to follow.

However, many brave young American men went to France to fly and fight for the Allied powers. They joined the Lafayette Escadrille fighter squadron. The Germans had better planes, weapons, and pilots. The average life expectancy for a fighter-pilot was three to six weeks. Why did these Americans volunteer to fight in France with certain death when their own country was not at war? This was a time when men were idealistic, but naive to embark on a great adventure. Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) was forced to leave his home in Arizona after the family ranch was foreclosed by the bank. Blaine sees a newsreel of fighter-pilots in France and decides that he has nothing to lose. Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) can't do anything right and is shamed into joining by his rich father. African-American boxer Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis) had been living in France, a racially tolerant country, for many years, wanted to give something back to his new country. These Americans were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault (Jean Reno) and American Squadron Leader Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson). They were the world's first combat pilots.\n\n(My Comment) The film was inspired by a true story. What that means is that the writers could write anything they wanted to about the pilots' personal lives. There were actually 38 American volunteers with an average age of 26 that joined the Lafayette Escadrille. Thirty were college educated and eleven were sons of millionaires. These men had a sense of adventure and romance of war, and they believed in "dying with honor." The movie uses a composite of these qualities of the actual pilots, and yes, there really was a black pilot in the squadron. The movie does not shy away from the real aspects of war or the sordid aspects of life on the ground. After every mission there are some pilots who do not return, and we get to see their replacements, and how the pilots deal with the loss of their friends. The aerial combat was exciting, tense, and realistic with the attack on the zeppelin being the best scene of the movie. There is a love story that slows the pace of the movie, and it was a little too long. You will love the scenes with Whiskey, their mascot lion. I think the writers could have used the real pilots' stories and names, and it would have been a better movie by giving credit to those young men. If you like war pictures this is a movie to see.

This is to say that a different set of principals are brought to bear on the subject matter. I'm sure that other in the U.S and around the world will(and have)expressed opinions, but this one comes from "a whole other country". Evolution is a very enjoyable film. It has been made in a summer of super event movies, and film/game conversions and I feel stands alone as the only comedy with an original source material (in sci-fi anyway).\n\nIt is highly enjoyable. If you're paying 5 pounds (or $8.50) you need to find a film that refreshes your sentiments with regards to just what a big "money" film should be. As I sit here smoking a cigarette and drinking a 7up, I figure this film to be a winner. The principals act in a manner appropriate to the subject material, and although Mr. Duchovny is not a comedy actor, I feel he acquits himself admirably in an unfamiliar field. Mr. Jones is a relative newcomer to the cinema, and I reckon that over time he may very well ascend to the the same esteemed level as Eddie Murphy, or his latterday composite (of sorts) Will Smith.\n\nThe plot is most sound, and although it draws some comparisons to "Ghostbusters" as other critics have noted, it stands alone as Summer 2001's most original comedy event movie. Mr Reitman, a veteran knows how to make films play easily, is one of the few directors who knows how to use good comedy actors. With this in mind, no one is underused, perhaps with the one exception of Mr. Dan Aykroyd, nowadays underrated for some insane reason, but who is extremely talented. It's a shame that Aykroyd's presence as a "big" man is more valued then his acting talent, because he's always a delight to watch.\n\nTo cut in some sourness, there's not a lot of involvement with the central characters, and you do find yourself watching people being cheated into a state of reaction at the expense of the colourful effects, but that's the way it was made, and we can't change that.\n\nIn all I would recommend this film to the less morose viewer, as it's cheerful, colourful, and does not require an over-critical view. Watch it, and the hell with the printed criticism - you'll enjoy it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":125303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2001-09-05","keywords":"shampoo,alien,chase,hero,helicopter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Evolution (2001)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2997027097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNmNDQ0ZWQtMWRjNy00NjRjLWJlNWMtOTUzZWYxYzdlZmY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNmNDQ0ZWQtMWRjNy00NjRjLWJlNWMtOTUzZWYxYzdlZmY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000141/","name":"David Duchovny"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428963/","name":"Orlando Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718645/","name":"Ivan Reitman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415979/","name":"Don Jakoby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224606/","name":"David Diamond"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919289/","name":"David Weissman"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is to say that a different set of principals are brought to bear on the subject matter. I'm sure that other in the U.S and around the world will(and have)expressed opinions, but this one comes from "a whole other country". Evolution is a very enjoyable film. It has been made in a summer of super event movies, and film/game conversions and I feel stands alone as the only comedy with an original source material (in sci-fi anyway).\n\nIt is highly enjoyable. If you're paying 5 pounds (or $8.50) you need to find a film that refreshes your sentiments with regards to just what a big "money" film should be. As I sit here smoking a cigarette and drinking a 7up, I figure this film to be a winner. The principals act in a manner appropriate to the subject material, and although Mr. Duchovny is not a comedy actor, I feel he acquits himself admirably in an unfamiliar field. Mr. Jones is a relative newcomer to the cinema, and I reckon that over time he may very well ascend to the the same esteemed level as Eddie Murphy, or his latterday composite (of sorts) Will Smith.\n\nThe plot is most sound, and although it draws some comparisons to "Ghostbusters" as other critics have noted, it stands alone as Summer 2001's most original comedy event movie. Mr Reitman, a veteran knows how to make films play easily, is one of the few directors who knows how to use good comedy actors. With this in mind, no one is underused, perhaps with the one exception of Mr. Dan Aykroyd, nowadays underrated for some insane reason, but who is extremely talented. It's a shame that Aykroyd's presence as a "big" man is more valued then his acting talent, because he's always a delight to watch.\n\nTo cut in some sourness, there's not a lot of involvement with the central characters, and you do find yourself watching people being cheated into a state of reaction at the expense of the colourful effects, but that's the way it was made, and we can't change that.\n\nIn all I would recommend this film to the less morose viewer, as it's cheerful, colourful, and does not require an over-critical view. Watch it, and the hell with the printed criticism - you'll enjoy it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":125303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2001-09-05","keywords":"shampoo,alien,chase,hero,helicopter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Evolution (2001)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2997027097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNmNDQ0ZWQtMWRjNy00NjRjLWJlNWMtOTUzZWYxYzdlZmY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNmNDQ0ZWQtMWRjNy00NjRjLWJlNWMtOTUzZWYxYzdlZmY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000141/","name":"David Duchovny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428963/","name":"Orlando Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718645/","name":"Ivan Reitman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415979/","name":"Don Jakoby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224606/","name":"David Diamond","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919289/","name":"David Weissman"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But their shared appearance is one best left open. ("I get a good vibe from these guys," the younger Hutch exclaims in one of the film's most savory self-referential moments.)\n\nThe film takes place in Bay City, "sometime during the '70s," when David Starsky (Stiller) -- a by-the-numbers police officer who spends his entire day chasing small-time crooks -- is paired up with a new partner, the reckless Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson (Wilson). Starsky and Hutch don't get along at first -- their mixed personalities collide, resulting in uncomfortable tension. Placed on an assignment involving an alleged drug lord (Vaughn), who has managed to create undetectable cocaine, Starsky and Hutch find themselves in a number of awkward situations: getting a statement by Big Earl (Ferrell), a dragon-obsessed inmate with some major issues; the usual tidbits of information from Huggy Bear (Dogg), a friend and informant of Hutch's; and of course the mandatory romantic subplot involving a pair of sexy cheerleaders.\n\nThe contrast of Starsky and Hutch is handled deliberately blunt: this comedy isn't as much a victim of the cop-buddy genre as it is a dead-on spoof. Hutch is a self-described "realist" -- during his introductory sequence he is shown fleeing the scene of a robbery with a stash of money. We assume he is undercover, and that's what he tells the cops when they try to arrest him. However, he's just using his badge as an excuse to commit crimes -- and get away with them.\n\nI asked myself if it was as possible as the film implies, but then the Constantly Yelling and/or Upset Police Captain (another clichéd role that happens to show up in all these movies) tells Hutch that it's the seventh time he's been arrested for robbery, and Hutch tells him that he's undercover -- trying to work his way in through the criminal underground. The joke, of course, is that we find out the robberies are all totally unrelated and bear no significant to a criminal underground of any kind.\n\nThere are a few sequences in the movie that deserve a description of their own, such as when Starsky accidentally consumes a large amount of cocaine and works himself into an ultimate-high-frenzy, battling on the disco floor of a nightclub for short-lived glory. After his opponent is unjustly awarded the gold medal, Starsky pulls out his gun and from there on the entire situation escalates into one of those scenes that -- like parts of Stiller's "There's Something About Mary" -- last on in viewers' minds even after the film itself fades away. The sort of sequence you might chuckle about to yourself as you drive home and recall certain moments from the film.\n\nStiller and Wilson -- presently two of Hollywood's most famous odd couples who have united together for a number of projects over the years -- are always likable in their films and nothing changes here. Wilson uses his sarcastic quips to an advantage, coming across as the smoother of the two, whereas Starsky is the bumbling and self-conscious idiot who is both over-protective and over-zealous.\n\nThe movie is at its best when it is cleverly satirizing the genre. Most of these films always include a sequence where the police captain will suspend the movie's protagonist and frown on him, saying something cheesy like, "Your father, who spent years on the force and was one of the highest-decorated officers, would be ashamed of you!" Instead, the police captain tells Starsky that his mother would be ashamed of him. And then after being suspended, Starsky takes a visit to his mother's grave and places a glazed donut on the headstone (she was the highly decorated cop in the family, apparently).\n\nThe film was directed by Todd Phillips, whose resume includes such raunchy efforts at comedy as the crude-but-enjoyable "Road Trip" and surprising "Old School." The latter film starred Ferrell and Vaughn and contained a cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg (as himself), so obviously these guys enjoyed working with Phillips and, I'm sure, agreed to contribute to this movie just for the heck of it.\n\nThe result is a very goofy, entertaining summer flick that never tries too hard and invariably never falls too hard, either. It does fall sometimes, but even then it usually takes its screw-ups with a pinch of salt. This is the sort of movie worth the price of admission -- just to sit back, forget your worries, and watch a couple of clowns bumble their way through an enjoyable farce of the '70s. It's not the kind of movie you'll be talking about after you see it -- just a simple popcorn flick. If you're out and about and you happen to stumble into a theater showing this film, you'll find your money well spent. I won't praise "Starsky and Hutch" for being a brilliant tongue-in-cheek spoof of the cop-buddy films -- I'll merely say that, for what it is, "Starsky and Hutch" is well-made and funny -- a surprisingly simple movie that is everything it pretends to be. The majority of films that use this approach suffer because they fall victim to their targets, especially most released this year, but where the others have failed "Starsky and Hutch" succeeds.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-04-06","keywords":"character names as title,buddy movie,night club,1970s,russian roulette","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Starsky &amp; Hutch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi25887001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2NjI1OTYtMDJiNy00MDY2LWE0Y2EtY2E5ZDI2NTZjODU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2NjI1OTYtMDJiNy00MDY2LWE0Y2EtY2E5ZDI2NTZjODU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Miramax"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004879/","name":"Snoop Dogg"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680846/","name":"Todd Phillips"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175068/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0088479/","name":"William Blinn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1192866/","name":"Stevie Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016088/","name":"John O'Brien"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sure, this is probably not gonna be a film for the ages, but it could be entertaining for ninety minutes.\n\nBut it's just horrible. Oh so horrible. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, if I account for the fact that they did indeed use professional actors. Danny Glover and Vinnie Jones have never been praised for their craft when playing the shallow roles they've played before. Here now, they are cast in character roles and that is a disaster. Jones tries to summon some gravitas by constantly suckling on this wee pipe of his and it looked ridiculous. The other male actors are underwhelming at best. They seem to have been selected because they all resemble other (more talented) actors.\n\nThe female lead was clearly cast based on "Who was the hottest chick that showed up?" Her acting is the worst.\n\nThe screenplay is just clown shoes. But the real highlight of this thing is the "ship". It looks like a carrack without sails, but wheels instead.

Sure, this is probably not gonna be a film for the ages, but it could be entertaining for ninety minutes.\n\nBut it's just horrible. Oh so horrible. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, if I account for the fact that they did indeed use professional actors. Danny Glover and Vinnie Jones have never been praised for their craft when playing the shallow roles they've played before. Here now, they are cast in character roles and that is a disaster. Jones tries to summon some gravitas by constantly suckling on this wee pipe of his and it looked ridiculous. The other male actors are underwhelming at best. They seem to have been selected because they all resemble other (more talented) actors.\n\nThe female lead was clearly cast based on "Who was the hottest chick that showed up?" Her acting is the worst.\n\nThe screenplay is just clown shoes. But the real highlight of this thing is the "ship". It looks like a carrack without sails, but wheels instead. It moves forward by means of ... erm, nobody knows. At the very least, they should have lamp-shaded it. But no.\n\nThis thing is only a 2/10 because the dragon special effects are somewhat decent.

What eventually was made by first time director Nick Mastandrea is sadly a disappointing entry into the genre. Where in the world was Wes?? This is not to say it didn't show some small moments of promise but it never quite rises to the occasion. The story revolves around a group of five childhood friends vacationing on an Island who come across a band of sinister German shepherds who have laid claim to the Isle after surviving what is explained as a "rabies" outbreak on a compound that sits on the other side of the Island which once housed a dog training facility. Most of the back story of the dogs isn't really explained and we're left with just a few specs of dialog from cast members Eric Lively and Oliver Hudson, who play siblings that grew up on the island, to to shed a dim light. The gang enjoy some sun and water until they are visited by a pup whose visit is more like an infiltration of the enemy camp and shares one of the better moments scenes with Hill Harper. Soon the dog-pack descends on our unsuspecting group who must now find a way off the Island before becoming dog-food. The best attack scene takes place in the house where our heroes have boarded themselves up but this isn't enough to save the film. The director was obviously asleep at the wheel and it shows when one of the characters ( I wont say which as not to spoil it) suffers an injury to the leg and later seems to forget they should be limping and they can be seen walking around like nothing ever happened. Where in the world was Wes??? Yes the setup is as old as wine but I still had hopes that the makers would inject some fresh blood into the story; it never happened. The film is hurt by uninspired camera work and the even more uninspired direction of Mastandrea.

Laws of Attraction is a rather well-worn comedy though that lacks sparkle. Two top divorce layers battle it out and eventually get romantic about each other. If the script sizzled it might be able to hold a candle, but it doesn't - which is a great shame given the great performances (Pierce Brosnan also does well, appearing far less wooden than in his James Bond roles). The whole film has a rather contrived feel to it that no amount of acting talent can salvage. Throwing in a bit of Irish countryside seems gratuitous in the extreme, a bit of cutesiness for the American box-office.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-29","keywords":"neo screwball comedy,workplace romance,coworker relationship,using others,love","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Laws of Attraction","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2744451353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000205/","name":"Parker Posey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0398185/","name":"Peter Howitt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054516/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112459/","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0363326/","name":"Robert Harling"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Laws of Attraction is a rather well-worn comedy though that lacks sparkle. Two top divorce layers battle it out and eventually get romantic about each other. If the script sizzled it might be able to hold a candle, but it doesn't - which is a great shame given the great performances (Pierce Brosnan also does well, appearing far less wooden than in his James Bond roles). The whole film has a rather contrived feel to it that no amount of acting talent can salvage. Throwing in a bit of Irish countryside seems gratuitous in the extreme, a bit of cutesiness for the American box-office.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-29","keywords":"neo screwball comedy,workplace romance,coworker relationship,using others,love","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Laws of Attraction","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2744451353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000205/","name":"Parker Posey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0398185/","name":"Peter Howitt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054516/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112459/","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0363326/","name":"Robert Harling"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As long as the action sequences are well made that is. "xXx: State of the Union" is a fair try in the genre but ultimately falls short.\n\nThe plot is as ridiculous as in the first movie. The NSA-agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) is once again looking in weird places trying to find a new agent that can break the rules and succeed. This time he finds Darius Stone (Ice Cube) in a military prison. Stone is an ex Navy Seal who will help Gibbons fight off a rogue part of the US Military trying to dispose of the president.\n\nSeriously, no one watches these movies for the plot anyway. So that the plot is ridiculous and cheesy is beside the point. No one watches this for the acting either. So that Ice Cube is not as much an actor as a walking scowl is ALSO beside the point. He does about as good a job as Vin Diesel did anyway. What is NOT beside the point though is the fact that "xXx: State of the Union" employs the same method of action filming as many other Hollywood-movies of late. You know the method: "move the camera exceptionally close and shake it like if the camera-man was a spastic". I know that this is to hide the fact that Ice Cube doesn't know how to fight. Still it's incredibly irritating! Also the lack of logic is too evident at times. Like Ice Cube driving a sports car 360km/h on a train track with his tires torn off... Seriously.\n\nOtherwise this had some potential. The technical quality is great, the movie looks really expensive. It has a lot of fun gadgets and crappy one-liners. And the speed of this movie is absolutely insane. Right from the beginning Lee Tamahori steps on it without ever looking back. So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring, there is always something happening on screen. But the flaws in mostly the action department as well as the complete lack of logic disturbs the experience. It's still a lot better than the first movie though. I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.\n\nSo in the end i think this "James Bond on steroids" will probably attract a lot of 15-yearolds that like when things keep moving and lights keep flashing. People who like to see a plot and at least some traces of logic might want to stay away though. It could have been the brainless action movie of the year, but it desperately needs some better action-directing for that.

What eventually was made by first time director Nick Mastandrea is sadly a disappointing entry into the genre. Where in the world was Wes?? This is not to say it didn't show some small moments of promise but it never quite rises to the occasion. The story revolves around a group of five childhood friends vacationing on an Island who come across a band of sinister German shepherds who have laid claim to the Isle after surviving what is explained as a "rabies" outbreak on a compound that sits on the other side of the Island which once housed a dog training facility. Most of the back story of the dogs isn't really explained and we're left with just a few specs of dialog from cast members Eric Lively and Oliver Hudson, who play siblings that grew up on the island, to to shed a dim light. The gang enjoy some sun and water until they are visited by a pup whose visit is more like an infiltration of the enemy camp and shares one of the better moments scenes with Hill Harper. Soon the dog-pack descends on our unsuspecting group who must now find a way off the Island before becoming dog-food. The best attack scene takes place in the house where our heroes have boarded themselves up but this isn't enough to save the film. The director was obviously asleep at the wheel and it shows when one of the characters ( I wont say which as not to spoil it) suffers an injury to the leg and later seems to forget they should be limping and they can be seen walking around like nothing ever happened. Where in the world was Wes??? Yes the setup is as old as wine but I still had hopes that the makers would inject some fresh blood into the story; it never happened. The film is hurt by uninspired camera work and the even more uninspired direction of Mastandrea. I hope somewhere, some place, someone will still make an old style killer dog flick with a decent plot, great camera work, and characters you can care about. Is that too much too ask?

    <title lang="hr">Profileri</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

War has been a societal issue since ancient Greece, and perhaps we have not yet learned the lessons that need to be learned.\n\nKudos to the director who has brought together story, talent, and visual art in one epic piece.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30934,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-04-13","keywords":"man with no name,final showdown,gore,bare chested male,dream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Seraphim Falls","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3833659673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjkxMDg3NjMtN2Y2MS00ZTg5LTk3OTEtY2Q0Y2JmMzRjOWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjkxMDg3NjMtN2Y2MS00ZTg5LTk3OTEtY2Q0Y2JmMzRjOWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001378/","name":"Anjelica Huston"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1204568/","name":"David Von Ancken"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073417/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1204568/","name":"David Von Ancken","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2042832/","name":"Abby Everett Jaques"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Steve Jobs is an idol, a revolutionary and an inspiration to the millions of people who want to change the world. After his death, his legendary status grew even more (as it always does with passed away celebrities), so it is perfectly reasonable that there were high expectations for this movie. People were expecting a grand masterpiece of epic proportions about a man who many want to relate to and who many want to be. \n\nUnfortunately, the movie took a slightly different turn and the result of this can be seen on the IMDb movie score. This movie is not an epic journey of a strange protégé who eventually achieved everything there was to achieve and was carried on the arms of a cheering crowd at the end, followed by the end credits. NO! This is a movie about Jobs - about his personality, about his decisions, about his victories and about his failures. It is a cruel representation of what you have to go through in this world to achieve the status that he now has. \n\nIt's a movie about a troubled hipster who wanted to learn and to achieve something, but hated the system into which the young are thrown into. He dropped out of College but still attended some classes, he got into fights at work because he would yell at his coworkers that they were not doing their job, he took other peoples ideas, remade them into a story and sold them with his speeches and he wanted all. He was stubborn, he always wanted the impossible and here comes the part that made him a legend: he always got the impossible out of people.\n\nEventually he was driven from his company, he made bad calls, bad decisions, bad products, but later came back and dominated the computer scene again.

Steve Jobs is an idol, a revolutionary and an inspiration to the millions of people who want to change the world. After his death, his legendary status grew even more (as it always does with passed away celebrities), so it is perfectly reasonable that there were high expectations for this movie. People were expecting a grand masterpiece of epic proportions about a man who many want to relate to and who many want to be. \n\nUnfortunately, the movie took a slightly different turn and the result of this can be seen on the IMDb movie score. This movie is not an epic journey of a strange protégé who eventually achieved everything there was to achieve and was carried on the arms of a cheering crowd at the end, followed by the end credits. NO! This is a movie about Jobs - about his personality, about his decisions, about his victories and about his failures. It is a cruel representation of what you have to go through in this world to achieve the status that he now has. \n\nIt's a movie about a troubled hipster who wanted to learn and to achieve something, but hated the system into which the young are thrown into. He dropped out of College but still attended some classes, he got into fights at work because he would yell at his coworkers that they were not doing their job, he took other peoples ideas, remade them into a story and sold them with his speeches and he wanted all. He was stubborn, he always wanted the impossible and here comes the part that made him a legend: he always got the impossible out of people.\n\nEventually he was driven from his company, he made bad calls, bad decisions, bad products, but later came back and dominated the computer scene again. He probably had more bad moments than good, but it's the good ones that count...and it's the good ones that changed the world.\n\nThe people didn't get what they wanted...they didn't get a people's hero nor the man that was always right. And no one wants to see a movie about a man who nobody liked half of the movie...but it is how he was and you have to accept that.\n\nAshton Kutcher's portrayal was also quite good and it seems that all the comedy movies and series that he has done have earned him a title of a bad actor, so you will hear a lot people saying this was a miss cast.

Now, I am all about a nice Friday the 13th marathon, or the original Texas Chainsaw massacre, or even Halloween (1978 version), but these are not so much horror as slasher films. I think the distinction is important before one even begins to determine how they feel about a movie. Same thing with people who conflate a thriller like say, North By Northwest (a little old school, but hopefully you take my point) with a horror film. As my wife and I sat in the car trying to find the right adjective to describe this film, we landed on disturbing. The music was freaky, the concept of being pursed endlessly, any statement of sexual promiscuity the filmmaker might be trying to make, was all disturbing in our minds. \n\nI would place this film with movies like Sinister, which my wife and I also "enjoyed;" best seen on a big screen with a massive tub of popcorn, holding the wife close.\n\nI get that some people hate it; somebody always hates a film, song, TV show, play, book etc, while others think it is a perfect 10.

Now, I am all about a nice Friday the 13th marathon, or the original Texas Chainsaw massacre, or even Halloween (1978 version), but these are not so much horror as slasher films. I think the distinction is important before one even begins to determine how they feel about a movie. Same thing with people who conflate a thriller like say, North By Northwest (a little old school, but hopefully you take my point) with a horror film. As my wife and I sat in the car trying to find the right adjective to describe this film, we landed on disturbing. The music was freaky, the concept of being pursed endlessly, any statement of sexual promiscuity the filmmaker might be trying to make, was all disturbing in our minds. \n\nI would place this film with movies like Sinister, which my wife and I also "enjoyed;" best seen on a big screen with a massive tub of popcorn, holding the wife close.\n\nI get that some people hate it; somebody always hates a film, song, TV show, play, book etc, while others think it is a perfect 10. For us, it was disturbing, and great way to spend about 90 minutes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":223601,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-03-13","keywords":"tied to a wheelchair,being followed,teenage girl,supernatural being,chloroform","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1876930073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc3NzA4Njk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg5MzIxNDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc3NzA4Njk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg5MzIxNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After a strange sexual encounter, a teenager finds herself haunted by nightmarish visions and the inescapable sense that something is after her.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2140860/","name":"Maika Monroe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1507857/","name":"Keir Gilchrist","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3459140/","name":"Olivia Luccardi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1379002/","name":"David Robert Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309207/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409060/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0497002/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1379002/","name":"David Robert Mitchell"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But this movie version strikes just the right balance of action and comedy, while also balancing fresh ideas with welcome nods to the TV series.\n\nAfter all, it wouldn't be "Get Smart" without "Would you believe...", "Sorry about that, Chief", or "Missed it by THAT much." It was also great to see such classics as the shoe phone, the Cone of Silence, Hymie the robot, and not one but two of the cars that Don Adams would have driven. But while some remakes mining the past for material have nothing new to say, and get stuck in paying homage to their predecessors, the "Get Smart" movie has a pretty good story of its own. \n\nNow this isn't Robert Ludlum material, and I doubt anyone is real surprised to see who turns out to be a bad guy, but it's a lot of fun along the way, with either a sight gag or surprisingly good action (and often both at the same time) coming down the pike every few minutes. There just aren't really any slow spots. I'm sure a lot of funny stuff got left on the cutting room floor (surely they didn't put Carrell in a fat suit for a mere ten seconds of film) but the pacing felt just right. We can catch all that other stuff when the DVD comes out at Christmas.\n\nSteve Carrel plays Agent 86 almost exactly the way he portrays Dunder-Mifflin's Michael Scott. He comes off as basically well-meaning and earnest, and although a bit bumbling at times, his Maxwell Smart is thankfully not Don Adam's version. Neither was this one of those "Naked Gun" characters who stumbles into success despite his incompetence; Smart has some hilariously bad moments, but is never made out to be simply a lucky fool.\n\nCarrell and Anne Hathaway have surprisingly good chemistry, and Alan Arkin is perfect taking over Edward Platt's role as "the Chief." Former wrestler Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson does a good job as Agent 23, and an even larger wrestler (7-foot 2-inch, 387-pound Dalip Singh from "The Longest Yard") is well-cast as a KAOS underling, although most of the other main bad guys are rather forgettable. Even TV-series KAOS agent Bernie Koppel shows up for a cameo, as does Patrick Warburton (who will be terrific in the inevitable sequel) and Bill Murray (almost unidentifiable hiding in a tree.) \n\nBottom line: you won't come out of this movie feeling as if you were cheated out of your money. Judging from the laughter in the theater and smiles in the lobby as we left, a lot of folks agreed with me. This is going to make a ton of money, and deserves it. Look for "Get Smart II" in a couple of years, and let's just hope it is as good as this one. \n\nP.S. - It's rated PG-13, but there's very little that's objectionable for even younger viewers (Carrel rips the seat out of his pants.)

He comes off as basically well-meaning and earnest, and although a bit bumbling at times, his Maxwell Smart is thankfully not Don Adam's version. Neither was this one of those "Naked Gun" characters who stumbles into success despite his incompetence; Smart has some hilariously bad moments, but is never made out to be simply a lucky fool.\n\nCarrell and Anne Hathaway have surprisingly good chemistry, and Alan Arkin is perfect taking over Edward Platt's role as "the Chief." Former wrestler Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson does a good job as Agent 23, and an even larger wrestler (7-foot 2-inch, 387-pound Dalip Singh from "The Longest Yard") is well-cast as a KAOS underling, although most of the other main bad guys are rather forgettable. Even TV-series KAOS agent Bernie Koppel shows up for a cameo, as does Patrick Warburton (who will be terrific in the inevitable sequel) and Bill Murray (almost unidentifiable hiding in a tree.) \n\nBottom line: you won't come out of this movie feeling as if you were cheated out of your money. Judging from the laughter in the theater and smiles in the lobby as we left, a lot of folks agreed with me. This is going to make a ton of money, and deserves it. Look for "Get Smart II" in a couple of years, and let's just hope it is as good as this one. \n\nP.S. - It's rated PG-13, but there's very little that's objectionable for even younger viewers (Carrel rips the seat out of his pants.) Take the kids, and have a good time!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":210711,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-08-13","keywords":"spy,male nudity,evil man,good versus evil,ticklishness","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Get Smart: Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3202810137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzMDAwMjQ3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzMDAwMjQ3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the third trailer for Get Smart, directed by Peter Segal.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000273/","name":"Alan Arkin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781842/","name":"Peter Segal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037759/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040022/","name":"Tom J.

The all-star voice cast includes Brendan Fraser, Rob Corddry, Ricky Gervais, William Shatner, Jessica Alba, Sofia Vergara, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jane Lynch, Craig Robinson, George Lopez, Steve Zahn and Chris Parnell. It's directed by first time feature film director, and former storyboard artist, Carl Brunker and written by Brunker, Bob Barlen, Tony Leech and Cory Edwards.

Gary never gets any of the credit though and even his own son Kip (Jonathan Morgan Heit) idolizes Scorch. When their boss, Lena (Alba), orders Scorch to travel to the 'Dark Planet' (Earth), in response to an SOS there, Gary knows it's a bad idea (due to the fact that no other alien life form has ever returned from there). He advises Scorch not to go on the mission but Scorch ignores him and the two get in a huge fight when Gary quits. Scorch goes on the mission without his brother's help, for the first time, and is captured and imprisoned at Area 51. It's of course up to Gary to save him.\n\nThe animation is beautiful to look at and has a lot of character to it, unfortunately the story doesn't. It's about as simplistic and by the numbers as you can get. I like a lot of the actors in this cast (especially Corddry, Gervais and Vergara) but their talents are wasted here. Fraser is perfectly cast as the dimwitted hero, once again, but he's the only star that really adds anything special to his role (which is funny because he's arguably the least talented). Like I said the whole Area 51 monster movie send-up is fun but that's about it. It should please kids but other than some great looking animation and a decent score (including a cool song by Owl City) the film has little else to offer adults.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n28SgCY6lwc","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-02-15","keywords":"psychotronic film,b movie,movie flop,astronomical object in title,astronaut","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1950917657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MjQ4MjE5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU1OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MjQ4MjE5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU1OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Astronaut Scorch Supernova finds himself caught in a trap when he responds to an SOS from a notoriously dangerous alien planet."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004695/","name":"Jessica Alba"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2117510/","name":"Cal Brunker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0414628/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779809/","name":"Bob Barlen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2117510/","name":"Cal Brunker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000410/","name":"Stephen Fry"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.\n\nJulianne Moore is great, as always. Neeson is perfect for this role, but one has to wonder how this behemoth of a guy fits in a airplane bathroom.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":257478,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-02-26","keywords":"die hard scenario,passenger,mind game,deception,suspense","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1005889561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NzE5OTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUxMjU0MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NzE5OTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUxMjU0MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"During a transatlantic flight from New York City to London, U.S. Air Marshal Bill Marks receives a series of cryptic text messages demanding that he instruct the airline to transfer $150 million into an off-shore account.

It was shocking. From beginning to end the movie is shock humor, gross-out humor, crass, offensive, childish and stupid. But you know what? I laughed a lot. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained throughout most of this movie. Sure, it follows a lot of road trip movie tropes and the perfunctory fight/make-up conflict near the end, but one thing about Dirty Grandpa is that it's consistent. Dirty joke after dirty joke; some of them hit, some of them miss, but they don't stop. Some of these things I never thought I'd hear come out of Robert De Niro's mouth, but the fact that it's him saying it makes it all the more funny. People will say this is a slap in the face to his legacy, but it really isn't. The Family was. Little Fockers was. This movie knows what it is - a lewd, politically incorrect road trip comedy, and it succeeds in that regard.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Dirty Grandpa is the chemistry between Zac Efron and Robert De Niro. They have a great comedic rapport that actually feels authentic, which helps the more insane scenes retain some semblance of realism (as thin as it may be). The rest of the cast is enjoyable too, especially Aubrey Plaza as the overtly slutty college girl who continuously surprised me with every grotesque statement uttered from her mouth. Oddly enough, De Niro feels right at home here. It's as if his character from Meet the Parents went off the deep end and decided to go on a spring break road trip with Zac Efron. Seriously, his character is ex-special forces and everything. Efron also proves once again that he's a comedic force to be reckoned with playing the straight corporate man put in awkward social situations.\n\nI don't know what people were expecting from Dirty Grandpa. Look at the title, look at the trailers. Are you really surprised? It was marketed as a gross-out comedy from day one, and guess what? It's gross. It's vile; it's degrading; it's shockingly inappropriate. Is it a good movie? Not a chance in hell. But the goal of a comedy is to make the viewer laugh, and Dirty Grandpa made me laugh. Hard.\n\nNow, if you don't like offensive humor, you should stay the hell away from this. Just know what you're getting into before seeing Dirty Grandpa and you can definitely have some fun watching it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118750,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-01-22","keywords":"grandfather grandson relationship,cowgirl sex position,nymphomaniac,sleeping naked,nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1755362585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MDkyNDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA5MzQ2NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MDkyNDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA5MzQ2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Right before his wedding, an uptight guy is tricked into driving his grandfather, a former Army general, to Florida for spring break."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1374980/","name":"Zac Efron"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3614913/","name":"Zoey Deutch"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0563243/","name":"Dan Mazer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577142/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4544229/","name":"John Phillips"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As he proved with his other film, "Gods and Monsters", Mr. Condon shows he doesn't mind tackling adult themes, so scarce in the present cinema.\n\nThe film is documentary in style, as we are shown the life of Kinsey at different times of his life. He had an unhappy childhood. His father was a tyrant who never really showed love toward him. There are moments when the young Kinsey is shown as boy scout and there is an element of homosexuality that maybe, for fear, never came to the surface, but it's there, nonetheless.\n\nDr. Kinsey's life takes a turn when he meets, Clara McMillen, who he calls "Mac". It's with her that he begins a life of discovery in the field of human sexuality that was taboo in American colleges and universities at the time. Albert Kinsey was the first one that spoke about the things that were never said in polite company, or in the classroom, up to that moment. His life was dedicated to understand what made human beings act the way they did, never being judgmental, but with a tremendous insight to interpret the data and present it in a comprehensible way.\n\nA puritanical American society reacted strongly against the findings of Dr. Kinsey. He was a man ahead of his times when he decided to gather information about the sex lives of Americans and to publish the results in a best selling book.\n\nAs Dr. Kinsey, Liam Neeson, showing an uncanny resemblance to the man, himself, does a wonderful job. He shows a complicated character who was not easily understood by his associates and students. As "Mac", his wife, Laura Linney with a dark wig, gives an articulate performance of Mrs. Kinsey. Both actors are wonderful together, as they have already shown in the New York stage. \n\nPeter Sargaard, as Clyde, Dr. Kinsey's first assistant, shows he is an actor that will amaze from picture to picture. This actor has the ability to get under each of his character's skins to make them real, as is the case with his Clyde. Also, almost unrecognizable, Chris O'Donnell, who plays Wardell, one of the interviewers working with the doctor. Timothy Hutton is Gebhard, the other associate who was instrumental in gathering the information to help complete Dr. Kinsey's report. John Lithgow, as Kinsey Sr. has a fantastic moment with Mr. Neeson, as he agrees to be interviewed, revealing a horrible secret. It's a wonderful moment done with panache by both actors working under exceptional direction.\n\nThere is a moment toward the end of the film where we see Lynn Redgrave speaking directly to the camera. It is one of the most effective moments in the film when this woman tells Dr. Kinsey about her life as a lesbian.\n\nMr. Condon's film clarifies a lot about the genius of Kinsey and his contribution to society.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48493,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"sexuality,character name as title,surname as title,lgbt plus,sex","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kinsey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224292121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001473/","name":"Laura Linney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Go ahead and call it "Aaron Brockovich." But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means. Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death. I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings.

Go ahead and call it "Aaron Brockovich." But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means. Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death. I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep. I love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it.

It is very dark; the 'good' characters are all mentally unstable, and everyone else is completely neglectful at best. The shots of the raunchy cityscape, and the snow-covered mountain scenes shot from above set the vibe really well. Some of the scenes, like the one where Miklós offers a beer to the protagonist, or when the local police chief is found stone drunk in his office are hilarious, and they go really well with the atmosphere of the movie. Acting is not particularly good, and the dialogue is pretty mediocre. There is a crime story which is slowly uncovered by the lead character, but you can never really get invested in it. You know right from the start that it is going to be something very dark and pointless; I was not even interested in getting an answer to questions you would ask in a typical crime story (like who and why etc.). All in all, Valan is only slightly better than an average movie, but if you look at it as an attempt to give us an insight into the long decay of a community, it is near perfect.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1210,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-21","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valan - Valley of Angels","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi197836569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMyYjhlOGUtNzdlNC00MDM4LThiYzctOTYxOTE1MzY0MmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMyYjhlOGUtNzdlNC00MDM4LThiYzctOTYxOTE1MzY0MmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2376399/","name":"Csaba Krisztik"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1237888/","name":"András Hatházi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9946451/","name":"Tollas Gábor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2723536/","name":"Béla Bagota"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0704416/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0339922/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0280812/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2723536/","name":"Béla Bagota"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is very dark; the 'good' characters are all mentally unstable, and everyone else is completely neglectful at best. The shots of the raunchy cityscape, and the snow-covered mountain scenes shot from above set the vibe really well. Some of the scenes, like the one where Miklós offers a beer to the protagonist, or when the local police chief is found stone drunk in his office are hilarious, and they go really well with the atmosphere of the movie. Acting is not particularly good, and the dialogue is pretty mediocre. There is a crime story which is slowly uncovered by the lead character, but you can never really get invested in it. You know right from the start that it is going to be something very dark and pointless; I was not even interested in getting an answer to questions you would ask in a typical crime story (like who and why etc.). All in all, Valan is only slightly better than an average movie, but if you look at it as an attempt to give us an insight into the long decay of a community, it is near perfect.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1210,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-21","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valan - Valley of Angels","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi197836569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMyYjhlOGUtNzdlNC00MDM4LThiYzctOTYxOTE1MzY0MmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMyYjhlOGUtNzdlNC00MDM4LThiYzctOTYxOTE1MzY0MmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2376399/","name":"Csaba Krisztik","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1237888/","name":"András Hatházi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9946451/","name":"Tollas Gábor"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2723536/","name":"Béla Bagota"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0704416/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0339922/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0280812/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2723536/","name":"Béla Bagota"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The character is widely popular among children, with shows, music and merchandising. Based on this premises the movie provides no introduction on who the characters are, as the main target (children in Norway) know him well. The movie itself is a light history around pirates, with some light jokes, action and everything that a child would like to see.

The character is widely popular among children, with shows, music and merchandising. Based on this premises the movie provides no introduction on who the characters are, as the main target (children in Norway) know him well. The movie itself is a light history around pirates, with some light jokes, action and everything that a child would like to see. The main character (Sabeltann) is not always the good or the bad guy and that is part of the culture built around him. In general it's a decent child's movie if they are aware or the background.

Will everything be alright in the end?"","reviewBody":"Jock's response for most of the time is "I don't know, sir". Just like my answer to a question, whether the film will be good based on watching the trailer. Well, it turns out once again that I should trust Johnny Depp and expect a good film because that is how Mortdecai turned out.\n\nMortdecai revolves around a rogue art dealer Lord Charlie Mortdecai, struggling to keep his fortune and estate. While being away from his wife he decides to grow a moustache, which becomes an annoying characteristic to everyone in his presence. Meanwhile a woman working on a restoration of a Goya painting is killed and Charlie as an art expert is called for help to retrieve the painting. Many different and strange parties are after this painting, because it is believed it contains a way to find lost Nazi golden treasure.\n\nEven though I have given a plot summary there is not much plot in the film, but don't be alarmed. If you recall the Peter Sellers starring The Pink Panther comedies then you might remember that those films also had minimum plot. The basic premise was there only to serve as a creator of situation, a mere thread upon which the scenes could be hanged. The film struggles at first to find its style of humor, but it succeeding at bringing back the aesthetic and style of the Pink Panther films which results in a very pleasant enjoyable comedy. That is all I wanted from this film.\n\nThe second part of the film, when it shifts into USA is just laugh out loud funny from start to finish. The film suffers from predictability though. I figured the location of the painting before the characters did. It is indirectly implied so that made it easier. Another problem is this film has an R rating but it doesn't really need one. Yes, there are two utterances of the F-word but otherwise it is a film suitable for the whole family (Considering that your kids are teenagers now in order for them to get all the jokes). There is nothing explicit so the best decision in order to get more money at the box office would be to obtain the PG-13 rating since lot of Depp's fans are teenagers as well, now unable to see the film.\n\nI have always enjoyed the master/servant dynamic in films ant TV series. It usually present in British culture. The best example would be Blackadder where this master/servant relationship is utterly genius. So it goes to say that best character is not the titular character but his servant Jock. He steals every scene he is in and Bettany and Depp have amazing chemistry and play off each other quite nicely. Paltrow and Depp make a nice duo as well despite not sharing much time together. For example the gag reflex during kissing caused by the moustache is a brilliant joke.\n\nGeoff Zanelli, a frequent Koepp's collaborator never disappoints but I feel like he can't ever top Secret Window score which is simply magnificent. The end credits song simply titled Johanna, which is a result of a collaboration of Zanelli, Mark Ronson and Miles Kane is a sweet song. A fitting end to cap this film. I have ended up listening it on repeat. It is a song made in a way in which they are not made anymore. An old fashioned tune that soothes my ears.\n\nTo point out something interesting I noticed Charlie is not much of the hero of the story in the sense that he is not controlling what is happening around him. He is manipulated by almost everyone – his wife, his servant, Goldblum's art dealer, the MI5. It is very interesting to have a main character, who is absolutely in no control of his destiny.\n\nMortdecai is a great enjoyable comedy for everyone who simply wants to have fun, relax and have a good time. Despite its predictability it delivers a great enjoyment, it delivers a comedy like which is not being made anymore.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70377,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-23","keywords":"art dealer,macguffin,burning a portrait,false portrait,fired from a job","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mortdecai Â– Now Playing ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4223839769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDgyMDEwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ5ODMxNDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDgyMDEwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ5ODMxNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Join Johnny Depp and an all-star cast in the comedy, Mortdecai."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113140/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0135149/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034487/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0036962/","name":"Eric Aronson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5795768/","name":"Kyril Bonfiglioli"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At least, that's what 'Grace of Monaco' suggests. It's probably not quite true, but the film doesn't pretend to be historically accurate. It says so at the beginning: it's a fictional drama, based on true events. \n\nThe film shows a relatively small part of Kelly's remarkable life. After having been married for six years to Prince Rainier of Monaco, she is visited by Alfred Hitchcock who offers her the lead in his film project 'Marnie'. She wants to do it, but reviving her acting career turns out to be impossible because of a crisis in Monaco, caused by French president Charles De Gaulle's political manoeuvrings. \n\nWe see Kelly as a somewhat naive Princess, who against her will becomes involved in political power-play. When a French diplomat suggests that Europe should become a third pillar of world power, next to the Soviet Union and the US, the American-born Kelly quips that this wouldn't be necessary if Europe wouldn't have invented communism and fascism. It's one of the best one-liners in the film. \n\nThe story switches nicely from Rainier's political problems to Kelly's own personal doubts. She is not happy as a Princess, and has trouble with the rigid conventions of life at the palace. The film even suggests that her outspoken opinions help solving the problems with France in the end. This may not be historically correct, but it makes for a nice script. \n\nMuch has been said about casting Nicole Kidman. I think there are very few actresses on the globe who would have done a better job. I'm not exactly a big fan of Kidman, but in this case she shows exactly the right mix of a strong will, a fearless non-conformist attitude and a superb elegance. She fits in perfectly with the cinematography, full of warm colours and lush images. \n\nI liked the way the script works towards an apotheosis: a speech by Kelly at a high-profile philanthropic event in Monaco. The speech is truly great; either it's very good script writing, or Kelly employed a very talented speech writer. It's the highlight of the film: Kidman delivers her text in a truly heartfelt way, with the camera extremely close, so only a part of her face is visible. \n\nThe film has weak points. The dialogue sometimes feels clumsy and pompous, there are too many subplots and intrigues, and the director indulges a bit too much in the glamorous palace life. But at least this film doesn't make the mistake of cramming too much biographical information into a 100-minute movie.

At least, that's what 'Grace of Monaco' suggests. It's probably not quite true, but the film doesn't pretend to be historically accurate. It says so at the beginning: it's a fictional drama, based on true events. \n\nThe film shows a relatively small part of Kelly's remarkable life. After having been married for six years to Prince Rainier of Monaco, she is visited by Alfred Hitchcock who offers her the lead in his film project 'Marnie'. She wants to do it, but reviving her acting career turns out to be impossible because of a crisis in Monaco, caused by French president Charles De Gaulle's political manoeuvrings. \n\nWe see Kelly as a somewhat naive Princess, who against her will becomes involved in political power-play. When a French diplomat suggests that Europe should become a third pillar of world power, next to the Soviet Union and the US, the American-born Kelly quips that this wouldn't be necessary if Europe wouldn't have invented communism and fascism. It's one of the best one-liners in the film. \n\nThe story switches nicely from Rainier's political problems to Kelly's own personal doubts. She is not happy as a Princess, and has trouble with the rigid conventions of life at the palace. The film even suggests that her outspoken opinions help solving the problems with France in the end. This may not be historically correct, but it makes for a nice script. \n\nMuch has been said about casting Nicole Kidman. I think there are very few actresses on the globe who would have done a better job. I'm not exactly a big fan of Kidman, but in this case she shows exactly the right mix of a strong will, a fearless non-conformist attitude and a superb elegance. She fits in perfectly with the cinematography, full of warm colours and lush images. \n\nI liked the way the script works towards an apotheosis: a speech by Kelly at a high-profile philanthropic event in Monaco. The speech is truly great; either it's very good script writing, or Kelly employed a very talented speech writer. It's the highlight of the film: Kidman delivers her text in a truly heartfelt way, with the camera extremely close, so only a part of her face is visible. \n\nThe film has weak points. The dialogue sometimes feels clumsy and pompous, there are too many subplots and intrigues, and the director indulges a bit too much in the glamorous palace life. But at least this film doesn't make the mistake of cramming too much biographical information into a 100-minute movie. It's an enjoyable movie about one of the most interesting women in film history.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-05-14","keywords":"monaco,1960s,betrayal,charles de gaulle character,alfred hitchcock character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3188107801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A snapshot of a year in the life of Grace Kelly as she strived to reconcile her past and her present, a yearning for a return to the big screen with her newfound role as a mother of two, monarch of a European principality and wife to Prince Ranier III.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672422/","name":"André Penvern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196860/","name":"Olivier Dahan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374957/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3885069/","name":"Arash Amel"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not because of the topic as this was already highlighted in "The Monuments Men", but because of the brilliant rendition Helen Mirren is showing here. A role that suits her perfectly. A distinguished elderly lady who's a descendant of a wealthy Jewish family and who was forced to flee to the United States during Austria's annexation with Germany. She left behind everything: family, personal things and valuable belongings that were owned by the family Altmann. The resentment towards the German ruler obviously is still as lively now as it was in the past. And despite her intention never to set foot on Austrian soil again, she still makes the overseas trip to reclaim the famous painting "Portrait of Adèle Bloch-Bauer" by Gustav Klimt, since she's the rightful heir. That this invaluable piece of art was worth a fortune, is swept aside by her as irrelevant. In the end the painting has been sold to a renowned New York art gallery for a mere 135 million dollars. I'm sure at that moment it wasn't irrelevant anymore.\n\nThe film is actually twofold. Obviously there's a less successful part and an exciting second part. The first part, and least successful, is about the court case Maria Altmann starts against the Austrian state, who consider the previous mentioned painting as a national treasure. The fact that it was stolen by the Nazis and actually ended up in their hands unlawfully, was a side issue apparently. So the first thing we are presented with, is an old fashioned courtroom drama with Ryan Reynolds as the young lawyer Randol Schönberg, grandson of the famous Austrian composer Arnold Schönberg and also descendant of a family of war refugees.\n\nThe fascinating and interesting part of the film focuses on the past and present of the widow Altmann. A metered mixture of images of this zestful character these days and the painful memories weighing on her shoulders. These memories are displayed in old-fashioned-looking sepia-colored flashbacks. A sketch full of contrasts of the still traumatized Maria and the conditions in which she lived during the occupation. The humiliations and fear. When she gets back in Vienna after so many years, Mary's facial expression proves that this past still weighs heavily on her.\n\nHelen Mirren is a kind of mixture of P. L. Travers and Queen Elizabeth. A lady behaving according to the etiquette from the upper middle class who keeps certain values and norms still alive. A stiff Victorian granny who suffers from a trauma and is seeking for justice. A kind of Miss Marple, but then still in possession of an elegant well-preserved beauty. Without any effort Mirren surpasses the young Reynold on screen. Despite his immense importance in the complex legal procedure, the character pales in comparison with the engaging, witty and sometimes tragic person performed by Mirren. Despite the fact that now and then she brings forward corny sounding quotes, she remains a credible and worthy character.\n\nOf course you can cite that the Austrian people are portrayed in a one-sided and caricatural way and look like an anti-Semitic nation that supports the Nazi-regime. Personally, I'm convinced that it's pretty close to being true and that it's more an instinctual survival tactic than that they were supporting that ideology. But that's another discussion. Maybe the relationship between Maria Altmann and her aunt Adèle could have been worked out a bit deeper. But the acting of Mirren and the tragic images of the past create an unparalleled film filled with tragedy and justice. \n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56407,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-04-10","keywords":"justice,austrian history,holocaust,art museum,looting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi278572569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sixty years after she fled Vienna during World War II, an elderly Jewish woman, Maria Altmann, starts her journey to retrieve family possessions seized by the Nazis, among them Klimt's famous painting 'The Lady in Gold'.

Phil Morrison, the director, is clearly a new voice in the cinema to be reckoned with. His immensely satisfying "Junebug" has the power to make the viewer gets absorbed into the drama he presents to his audience. Based on a screen play by Angus MacLachlan, the film is a pleasant surprise.\n\nIf you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.\n\nAt the start of the film, we are taken to Madeleine's gallery in Chicago where an art auction is taking place. The lovely Madeleine is seen behind the scenes, when she suddenly happens to catch sight of George, who happens to be at the event. We are aware of Madeleine's lust for the handsome George, and as fate would have it, they get married.\n\nWhen Madeleine decides to go to visit one eccentric painter in North Carolina, a visit to George's family is in order. The contrast between the worldly Madeleine and her new in-laws is something we realize right away. The mother, Peg, is a controlling woman who presides over the big household. She is weary of strangers, as she perceives Madeleine to be. The father, Eugene, is a taciturn man who clearly wants to stay away from his wife, hiding in the basement, where he carves animal figures that we never get to see. Johnny, the other son, seems to be resentful of his brother for having left home. His wife Ashley, is the only person who seems to be happy, or at least, adjusted to her situation and surroundings.\n\nThe basic trouble with this family is that they don't communicate. Nothing is ever heard about what has made them grow apart. There is no warmth whatsoever from Peg toward anyone at all. In fact, for being this a Christian family, they exhibit no kindness toward Madeleine, who tries to connect with them, to no avail. Johnny misreads his new sister-in-law's kindness with sexuality, which is clearly not the case. It's only Ashley, the simple girl with a heart of gold who seems to be having some semblance being well adjusted in spite of the coldness of her new home.\n\nAmy Adams and Embeth Davidtz, who play Amy and Madeleine, respectively, give amazing portrayals of these two opposite women. Ms. Adams is one of the best things in the film because she hasn't been touched by whatever is making the rest of the family so miserable. Embeth Davidtz, one of the best young actresses working in film and in the theater these days gives a graceful account of Madeleine, a woman of a different background who is accepting and wants to be accepted by her new family.\n\nThe rest of the cast is well balanced. Benjamin McKenzie is seen as the frustrated Johnny, who is clearly an unhappy man living with his family. Alessandro Nivola has a great moment when he is asked to sing a hymn at a church gathering. Celia Weston makes Peg, into a mystery, as we can't conceive her reaction toward the woman who married George and can't accept her. Scott Wilson is the father.\n\n"Junebug" is a film that will stay with the viewer for quite a long time after it's finished. Mr. Morrison makes us get involved in the situation he is presenting for us. Clearly, not a film for the great masses, but it will gratify fans of this type of indie that shows a director who clearly has things under control and is not afraid to get the viewer involved in the story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-09-16","keywords":"incommunicability,favorite child,dysfunctional family,mother son relationship,soda","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Junebug","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2173894937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkYTMxMGQtYmJjZC00Y2M1LThjNmYtMzIyNzdhYTI4MzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkYTMxMGQtYmJjZC00Y2M1LThjNmYtMzIyNzdhYTI4MzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001110/","name":"Embeth Davidtz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9165472/","name":"David Kuhn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607275/","name":"Phil Morrison"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0307988/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130058/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533666/","name":"Angus MacLachlan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":341339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2019-10-24","keywords":"nazi germany,world war two,satire,mother son relationship,black comedy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663366425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer director Taika Waititi (THOR: RAGNAROK, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE), brings his signature style of humor and pathos to his latest film, JOJO RABBIT, a World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy (Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.

As the movie opens, it is "2007" and an Asian-American girl named Dorothy is getting ready for work at a strip club. Then a Latina woman named Ramona makes her grand entrance and does a spectacular pole dance as Fiona Apple's "Criminal" blasts from the speakers. Duly impressed, Dorothy reaches out to Ramona for some dancing tips, and the two hit it off. We then go to "2014" where we see Dorothy being interviewed by a journalist... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Lorene Scafaria, whose "Seeking a Friend For the End of the World" some years ago was one of my favorite movies of that year. Here she takes a New York magazine article and turns it into a wild, wild movie. Beware: not much is left to the imagination. The grand entrance of Jennifer Lopez in that opening scene's pole dance is nothing short of stunning. In fact, the same can be said about Lopez's overall performance, which should be Oscar nomination-worthy, and certainly is a career-best performance. Lopez turned 50 this year, and looks about 35. She takes control of the movie, and requests, makes that demands, your attention. You are more than happy to give it to her. Constance Wu, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhardt round out the primary performers. Check out Cardi B and Lizzo (part of the strip gang). When a movie's principal set is a strip club, you can expect a lot of fist-pumping music, and the movie more than delivers on that level.

As the movie opens, it is "2007" and an Asian-American girl named Dorothy is getting ready for work at a strip club. Then a Latina woman named Ramona makes her grand entrance and does a spectacular pole dance as Fiona Apple's "Criminal" blasts from the speakers. Duly impressed, Dorothy reaches out to Ramona for some dancing tips, and the two hit it off. We then go to "2014" where we see Dorothy being interviewed by a journalist... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Lorene Scafaria, whose "Seeking a Friend For the End of the World" some years ago was one of my favorite movies of that year. Here she takes a New York magazine article and turns it into a wild, wild movie. Beware: not much is left to the imagination. The grand entrance of Jennifer Lopez in that opening scene's pole dance is nothing short of stunning. In fact, the same can be said about Lopez's overall performance, which should be Oscar nomination-worthy, and certainly is a career-best performance. Lopez turned 50 this year, and looks about 35. She takes control of the movie, and requests, makes that demands, your attention. You are more than happy to give it to her. Constance Wu, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhardt round out the primary performers. Check out Cardi B and Lizzo (part of the strip gang). When a movie's principal set is a strip club, you can expect a lot of fist-pumping music, and the movie more than delivers on that level. In addition to the aforementioned Fiona, there are songs from Britney Spears, Janet Jackson ("Control", of course), Fat Joe, Queen She, 50 Cent, and many, many more.\n\n"Hustlers" premiered a few weeks ago at the Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim, and was released wide last weekend (outperforming expectations at the box office).

His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.\n\n James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.\n\nKathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film. \n\nEverything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.\n\nThis would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1099002,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"keywords":"iceberg,sailor's death,love affair,mass death,sunken ship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Release","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi907189785","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzczNjA2MTY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyNDY2NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzczNjA2MTY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyNDY2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the new trailer for James Cameron's Academy Award winning blockbuster, coming to theaters in 3D.

Especially in fighting scenes.\n\n\n\nBut it's a great movie all over. 9/10\n\n\n\nThank you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3547,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2019-11-08","keywords":"world war one,male nudity,male rear nudity,skinny dipping,murder","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi930790937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzIzZjRlYzctYjgyNy00NWQ5LWE1ZjUtODI5ZGVhMzM2ZWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzIzZjRlYzctYjgyNy00NWQ5LWE1ZjUtODI5ZGVhMzM2ZWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9415555/","name":"Oto Brantevics","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11130883/","name":"Greta Trusina","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898462/","name":"Martins Vilsons"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4437136/","name":"Dzintars Dreibergs"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296685/","name":"Boris Frumin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8457574/","name":"Aleksandrs Grins"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12047,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A real treat for UFO geeks!\n\nThe History Channel shows just seems to get better- Keep it up please!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11907,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-01-08","keywords":"alien conspiracy,female soviet spy,soviet spy ring,men in black,lesbian interest","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318821/","name":"Aidan Gillen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3295096/","name":"Michael Malarkey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0579728/","name":"Laura Mennell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0417365/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0467028/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448486/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2151033/","name":"David O'Leary"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2445785881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwMDFlNDMtNjFjNC00NmVmLTgxZmMtM2IwNDg2MTgxMjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwMDFlNDMtNjFjNC00NmVmLTgxZmMtM2IwNDg2MTgxMjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer - HISTORY's new UFO drama series "Project Blue Book" starring Aidan Gillen ("Game of Thrones") and Michael Malarkey ("The Vampire Diaries").

Indeed, aside from very soft references to prohibition and slavery (in that order) the series appears to ignore the social references and culture of the times, and the aforementioned 1920s female detective appears to glide through unencumbered, except for the very soft and predictable love interest from the local news hack. Hardly believable, and only suitable for a kid's series. It's a shame, the period locations, sets and costumes were enjoyable, and the supporting cast was OK.

It is undoubtedly cleaner than the real 16th Century world but has the feeling of authenticity about it.\n\nThere are some horrendous historical liberties taken by the producers. Arthur &amp; Catherine were 15 when they married. Arthur died before his 16th birthday. Henry was 10, going on 11, over the 6 months of Catherine's marriage. Given most of the series is about Henry &amp; Catherine's relationship the producers saw fit to make Henry &amp; Arthur a similar age, maybe 18 &amp; 19, respectively. Fair enough, but it does ensure a divergence from the historical facts, which is a pity.\n\nThe other and maybe more relevant fact is why Catherine was chosen to be the wife of the English heir male. She was descended from the legitimate English Lancastrian line via her mother. She had a stronger claim to the English throne than Henry VII, who was descended from an illigitimate Lancastrian line. The male offspring of Catherine would legitimise the Tudor dynasty. For this reason Henry VII, his wife &amp; his mother would be moving heaven &amp; earth to keep Catherine in England. Indeed, she became a virtual prisoner of the English crown for 7 years before she married her brother in law, the young Henry.\n\nOverall, the historical costume drama is enjoyable enough and given it's only 10 episodes makes it easy enough to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6575,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-05-04","keywords":"monarchy,arranged marriage,16th century,starz,royalty","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3882295/","name":"Laura Carmichael","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4704866/","name":"Aaron Cobham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3745225/","name":"Charlotte Hope"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0687726/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022057/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0361727/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296491/","name":"Emma Frost","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334213/","name":"Matthew Graham"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Season 2 on STARZ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810495257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE0OTdjZGQtOGE2Mi00YmUwLTlmZTQtY2RjNDc3Y2VhNGNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE0OTdjZGQtOGE2Mi00YmUwLTlmZTQtY2RjNDc3Y2VhNGNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon, navigates the royal lineage of England with an eye on the throne."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As you probably know the Manhattan Project was a research and development project for the first Atomic Bomb, thus the name of the show Manh(A)ttan with the middle A stylized as separated.\n\nThe series follows the lives of the families living in a strict, military controlled, village in the middle of the desert. In that place paranoia rules. Because of the big secret (the development of the "gadget" as they call it) everyone is considered a possible leak or a suspect for espionage. Their correspondence to the outside world is controlled, the army makes random checks to them and their belongings, they even have to take polygraph tests if they seem more suspicious than others.\n\nThe production has nothing to envy from a feature film. Attention to detail. Countless extras and above all a remarkable cinematography. The way they make you feel the "space", the atmosphere of this place is extraordinary. \n\nI hope it will continue in the same fashion and not consume itself in many subplots and little dramas that will make it tiresome. (If it does, it wouldn't be the first time a great pilot is followed by mediocre episodes). But for now...\n\n***Highly recommended.\n\nUPDATE after having seen 9 episodes\n\nUnfortunately my fears have been realized. The show is full of pointless subplots and is now boring and far from entertaining.\n\nOppenheimer's screen time is measured in ...seconds in the 10 hours I wasted to watch this.\n\nThe race for the atomic bomb and WW2 is almost absent.\n\nIt's all about the lives and the little dramas of the wives, the mistresses and the ..$2 prostitutes who live in the camp. Who gets high with what, who is screwing whom etc.\n\nMaybe they should change the title to MANHATTAN HOUSEWIVES.\n\n***Overall: Avoid it. I'm changing my rating from 8 to a (very generous) 4.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8180,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer.

As soon as I had finished watching I watched it again taking in all the things I had missed the first time, I have my dictionary/computer on hand to research some of the phrases and words which adds to the enjoyment. I do not listen to opera or classical music but yearn to know what the wonderful soundtrack comprises of. The characters and relationship of Morse and Thursday is captivating. This is British TV drama at its very best. I just hope it is kept real and Oxford does not become more infamous than 'Denton Woods'!

As you probably know the Manhattan Project was a research and development project for the first Atomic Bomb, thus the name of the show Manh(A)ttan with the middle A stylized as separated.\n\nThe series follows the lives of the families living in a strict, military controlled, village in the middle of the desert. In that place paranoia rules. Because of the big secret (the development of the "gadget" as they call it) everyone is considered a possible leak or a suspect for espionage. Their correspondence to the outside world is controlled, the army makes random checks to them and their belongings, they even have to take polygraph tests if they seem more suspicious than others.\n\nThe production has nothing to envy from a feature film. Attention to detail. Countless extras and above all a remarkable cinematography. The way they make you feel the "space", the atmosphere of this place is extraordinary. \n\nI hope it will continue in the same fashion and not consume itself in many subplots and little dramas that will make it tiresome. (If it does, it wouldn't be the first time a great pilot is followed by mediocre episodes). But for now...\n\n***Highly recommended.\n\nUPDATE after having seen 9 episodes\n\nUnfortunately my fears have been realized. The show is full of pointless subplots and is now boring and far from entertaining.\n\nOppenheimer's screen time is measured in ...seconds in the 10 hours I wasted to watch this.\n\nThe race for the atomic bomb and WW2 is almost absent.\n\nIt's all about the lives and the little dramas of the wives, the mistresses and the ..$2 prostitutes who live in the camp. Who gets high with what, who is screwing whom etc.\n\nMaybe they should change the title to MANHATTAN HOUSEWIVES.\n\n***Overall: Avoid it.

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12047,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And how similar Dylan Farrow's testimony is to the allegation made by Michael Jackson's victims. Both Jackson and Allen have a fanbase that would chose not to believe and accuse the victim. . Both men used the same grooming tactics. The tactics of isolating Dylan from other family member including her mother. . Jackson employed the same methods. Showering extreme affection on one child..

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were.

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And just because someone give millions to charity and claims to adore all children does not mean he didn't sexually abuse some.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"2021-02-21","keywords":"tv mini series,child sexual abuse,me too movement,reference to woody allen,sexual grooming","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001201/","name":"Mia Farrow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696660/","name":"Fletcher Previn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0642717/","name":"Dylan O'Sullivan Farrow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242489/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0671377/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3880108313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allen V.

And how similar Dylan Farrow's testimony is to the allegation made by Michael Jackson's victims. Both Jackson and Allen have a fanbase that would chose not to believe and accuse the victim. . Both men used the same grooming tactics. The tactics of isolating Dylan from other family member including her mother. . Jackson employed the same methods. Showering extreme affection on one child.. Both Allen and Jackson had private designated areas to take their victims for intimate "alone " time'. And the parents were somewhat aware or made aware of going ons but chose to be complacent. Now many will deny and make excuses for these two men because they were great entertainers . But a rapist doesn't' assault every woman. Dog abusers don't abuse every dog they own. And just because someone give millions to charity and claims to adore all children does not mean he didn't sexually abuse some.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"2021-02-21","keywords":"tv mini series,child sexual abuse,me too movement,reference to woody allen,sexual grooming","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001201/","name":"Mia Farrow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696660/","name":"Fletcher Previn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0642717/","name":"Dylan O'Sullivan Farrow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242489/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0671377/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3880108313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allen V.

Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dragnet was created as a move by the LAPD to shore up its image in the wake of a lot of corruption scandals. It certainly did its job showing that organization through the eyes of tough and honest Jack Webb and partners Ben Alexander and Harry Morgan. \n\nThe NYPD in 2010 until now is seen through the eyes of the Reagan Family, a tough Irish American family where you go into law enforcement as a tradition. The current commissioner is Tom Selleck and the retired one is his father Len Cariou. Selleck has two sons, veteran detective Donnie Wahlberg and newly minted Academy graduate Will Estes. His daughter Bridget Moynahan is an Assistant District Attorney and there's a late son killed on the job. Wahlberg is married to Amy Carlson and they have two sons and Moynahan is divorced raising a daughter.\n\nThe characters are united by blood, but their opinions sure differ. There is the obligatory scene by now of the family dinner where issues raised during a given episode are given a thorough hearing. We also see the human side of the Reagans. The scene is very much like those patrol car scenes in Dragnet with Jack Webb and his partners who show their human face in some of the innocuous chit chat. The Reagan dinner talk is more substantial, but serves the same purpose.\n\nBlue Bloods is how the NYPD sees itself and it's the image they want to convey to the public. And it's a very good police drama.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Dragnet was created as a move by the LAPD to shore up its image in the wake of a lot of corruption scandals. It certainly did its job showing that organization through the eyes of tough and honest Jack Webb and partners Ben Alexander and Harry Morgan. \n\nThe NYPD in 2010 until now is seen through the eyes of the Reagan Family, a tough Irish American family where you go into law enforcement as a tradition. The current commissioner is Tom Selleck and the retired one is his father Len Cariou. Selleck has two sons, veteran detective Donnie Wahlberg and newly minted Academy graduate Will Estes. His daughter Bridget Moynahan is an Assistant District Attorney and there's a late son killed on the job. Wahlberg is married to Amy Carlson and they have two sons and Moynahan is divorced raising a daughter.\n\nThe characters are united by blood, but their opinions sure differ. There is the obligatory scene by now of the family dinner where issues raised during a given episode are given a thorough hearing. We also see the human side of the Reagans. The scene is very much like those patrol car scenes in Dragnet with Jack Webb and his partners who show their human face in some of the innocuous chit chat. The Reagan dinner talk is more substantial, but serves the same purpose.\n\nBlue Bloods is how the NYPD sees itself and it's the image they want to convey to the public. And it's a very good police drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My only strong complaint is the butchery done to Catherine Martin's character, and I don't know where that storyline is going, so I'm trying to reserve judgement.\n\nHad to laugh at Clarice needing a better psychiatrist.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8026,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2021-02-11","keywords":"agent,fbi agent,female fbi agent,fbi investigation,investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2843024/","name":"Rebecca Breeds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0191044/","name":"Michael Cudlitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040739/","name":"Jayne Atkinson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500500/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0845375/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0845376/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476064/","name":"Alex Kurtzman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525886/","name":"Jenny Lumet"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi521126169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdlNDVhYjktZTEyMC00MzkzLWI4YWYtZmNkODIyNWYxNmUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdlNDVhYjktZTEyMC00MzkzLWI4YWYtZmNkODIyNWYxNmUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Set one year after the events of The Silence of the Lambs, join Agent Clarice Starling in this new psychological thriller that takes a deep dive into her untold personal story.

I don't really care about Higgins being cast as a woman. What I miss is the relationship in the original show, a relationship which cannot exist in this reboot of the show.\n\nIn the original series, Magnum and Higgins represented two archetypes.\n\nHiggins, the elder of the two, represented a warrior of an older, for formal era. As we learned more about him, we discovered that his stiff upper lip concealed an action-packed history of service.\n\nMagnum, the younger, represented the Viet Nam era. During this time, military service was changing, reflecting the less formal society of the 1960's and 70's. Service people came home with the memories of a wet jungle war and were no longer considered heroes.\n\nOver the course of the series, we saw a grudging growth by both, each gaining respect for the other. While almost never a central element of any story, the ongoing subplot enriched the series. As well, Higgins age and experience allowed the character to be both a hero and a damsel in distress without negative impact.\n\nIn this reboot, Higgins is younger than Magnum. She is intelligent, attractive, supremely confident and competent in almost all things. By resetting the structure in this way, she becomes an antagonistic partner and an ongoing potential love interest. Moreover, if we consider Magnum a competent protagonist, she cannot bring the element of greater experience to the relationship.\n\nThe Higgins character could easily be played by by either a male or female. I suppose that casting Perdita Weeks, who plays what she is given with some skill, was to appeal to middle aged men who enjoy the scenery. Had they cast a woman 20 years older, a different older chemistry could have blossomed, one of respect, cooperation and affection. In this remake, we are stuck with another will they/won't they relationship.\n\nThis remake is unexceptional and it hardly required watching for me. Still, it had potential.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10679,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-09-24","keywords":"hawaii,private investigator,remake,former navy sea air and land force,car","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379596/","name":"Jay Hernandez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0917347/","name":"Perdita Weeks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461149/","name":"Zachary Knighton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0715350/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374900/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1325865/","name":"Eric Guggenheim"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006997/","name":"Peter M.

What I miss is the relationship in the original show, a relationship which cannot exist in this reboot of the show.\n\nIn the original series, Magnum and Higgins represented two archetypes.\n\nHiggins, the elder of the two, represented a warrior of an older, for formal era. As we learned more about him, we discovered that his stiff upper lip concealed an action-packed history of service.\n\nMagnum, the younger, represented the Viet Nam era. During this time, military service was changing, reflecting the less formal society of the 1960's and 70's. Service people came home with the memories of a wet jungle war and were no longer considered heroes.\n\nOver the course of the series, we saw a grudging growth by both, each gaining respect for the other. While almost never a central element of any story, the ongoing subplot enriched the series. As well, Higgins age and experience allowed the character to be both a hero and a damsel in distress without negative impact.\n\nIn this reboot, Higgins is younger than Magnum. She is intelligent, attractive, supremely confident and competent in almost all things. By resetting the structure in this way, she becomes an antagonistic partner and an ongoing potential love interest. Moreover, if we consider Magnum a competent protagonist, she cannot bring the element of greater experience to the relationship.\n\nThe Higgins character could easily be played by by either a male or female. I suppose that casting Perdita Weeks, who plays what she is given with some skill, was to appeal to middle aged men who enjoy the scenery. Had they cast a woman 20 years older, a different older chemistry could have blossomed, one of respect, cooperation and affection. In this remake, we are stuck with another will they/won't they relationship.\n\nThis remake is unexceptional and it hardly required watching for me. Still, it had potential.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10679,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-09-24","keywords":"hawaii,private investigator,remake,former navy sea air and land force,car","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379596/","name":"Jay Hernandez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0917347/","name":"Perdita Weeks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461149/","name":"Zachary Knighton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0715350/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374900/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1325865/","name":"Eric Guggenheim","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006997/","name":"Peter M.

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135160,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-24","keywords":"archeologist,based on video game,sequel,altered version of studio logo,eight word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Two: The Cradle of Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi143786265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057368/","name":"Chris Barrie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212988/","name":"Dean Georgaris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

The story revolves around Will Stronghold( Michael Angarano) who is the kid of two superhero parents, The Commander( Kurt Russell) and Jetstream( Kelly Preston). Will is off to be a freshman at his dad's alma mater- Sky High, a school for superheroes where they can find their powers and learn how to use them. High school angst is then thrown into the mix as Will and his new group of friends, headed up by the typical girl best friend Layla( Danielle Panabaker), are told they don't fit the superhero mold and become sidekicks, otherwise known as the losers of the school. \n\nI loved the idea of this movie and the people in it seemed to be having a great time. The roles were cast perfectly and it was easy to believe everyone. A few favorites were Warren Peace( Steven Strait), Layla and Zach( Nicholas Braun). Sure the plot was a tad predictable, both in the superhero plot and in the teen drama area but because of the setting and the mix it made it still worth seeing. Also, anything that has Bruce Campbell, who plays Coach Boomer, is automatically quirky enough to be given a chance. Of course the world ends up in danger and the underdogs must fight to save it, but for once I wasn't upset that I knew it all.\n\nDisney needed a hit as the past few movies it's put out that were live action failed to do much. I think Sky High is it. Action for the boys, cute boys and drama for the girls and Kurt Russell for the moms- great family movie. All I can end with is I can't wait for it to come out on video.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":83369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-07-29","keywords":"coming of age,non comic book superhero,superheroine,teen movie,male protagonist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sky High","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2730492185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRlN2U5MDMtNjUzYy00YTUwLTg4NDItN2FhYjRiNzZlNzUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRlN2U5MDMtNjUzYy00YTUwLTg4NDItN2FhYjRiNzZlNzUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #1 Post"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000621/","name":"Kurt Russell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000593/","name":"Kelly Preston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0029400/","name":"Michael Angarano"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007784/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0134201/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467549/","name":"Paul Hernandez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774792/","name":"Bob Schooley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0566407/","name":"Mark McCorkle"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story revolves around Will Stronghold( Michael Angarano) who is the kid of two superhero parents, The Commander( Kurt Russell) and Jetstream( Kelly Preston). Will is off to be a freshman at his dad's alma mater- Sky High, a school for superheroes where they can find their powers and learn how to use them. High school angst is then thrown into the mix as Will and his new group of friends, headed up by the typical girl best friend Layla( Danielle Panabaker), are told they don't fit the superhero mold and become sidekicks, otherwise known as the losers of the school. \n\nI loved the idea of this movie and the people in it seemed to be having a great time. The roles were cast perfectly and it was easy to believe everyone. A few favorites were Warren Peace( Steven Strait), Layla and Zach( Nicholas Braun). Sure the plot was a tad predictable, both in the superhero plot and in the teen drama area but because of the setting and the mix it made it still worth seeing. Also, anything that has Bruce Campbell, who plays Coach Boomer, is automatically quirky enough to be given a chance. Of course the world ends up in danger and the underdogs must fight to save it, but for once I wasn't upset that I knew it all.\n\nDisney needed a hit as the past few movies it's put out that were live action failed to do much. I think Sky High is it. Action for the boys, cute boys and drama for the girls and Kurt Russell for the moms- great family movie. All I can end with is I can't wait for it to come out on video.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":83369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-07-29","keywords":"coming of age,non comic book superhero,superheroine,teen movie,male protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sky High","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2730492185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRlN2U5MDMtNjUzYy00YTUwLTg4NDItN2FhYjRiNzZlNzUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRlN2U5MDMtNjUzYy00YTUwLTg4NDItN2FhYjRiNzZlNzUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #1 Post","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000621/","name":"Kurt Russell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000593/","name":"Kelly Preston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0029400/","name":"Michael Angarano"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007784/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0134201/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467549/","name":"Paul Hernandez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774792/","name":"Bob Schooley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0566407/","name":"Mark McCorkle"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not only because I am so terribly interested in the exploration of space and the historical events that have taken place - but because it's a great film with excellent performances and a truth-telling style. Heck, even Lovell's wife dropping the wedding ring in the shower the day of the launch is true!\n\nJust the fact that this film is true makes it even more enjoyable. It's hard to understand how in the hell one can make it back to Earth and survive with a fatally crippled space-craft. It's even harder to appreciate just how close they actually got to dying out there.\n\nThe performances are astounding. Ed Harris is just stupendous as Gene Krantz, and Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Garty Sinise and Bill Paxton (who seems to always get the role as the whiner...) are also great.\n\nAs Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":318968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

On the whole, it's well worth a visit, even if you have never lived in that era.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":177819,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-28","keywords":"safe deposit,heist,chase,mobster,london england","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004787/","name":"Saffron Burrows","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1304386/","name":"Stephen Campbell Moore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037759/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166074/","name":"Dick Clement","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0478588/","name":"Ian La Frenais"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, "The Dark Knight", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, "The Dark Knight Rises"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. \n\nThe film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.\n\nAt a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum. \n\nIn conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.

In 2014, upon the announcement of 'The Lego Movie', despite my love for the toy, I was kinda doubting the general premise. How could you make a movie out of Lego? Well, that question was soon answered as I gawped in awe at the screen, the movie was fantastic. Now, the character from 'The Lego Movie'' that garnered the most love was Batman, a cocky, sarcastic, childish take on the superhero we know and love... well it was only going to be a matter of time before he got his own motion picture.\n\n'The Lego Batman Movie' was definitely an enjoyable ride, and whilst I think it lacks in comparison to its predecessor, it stills thrusts us back into the universe that we came to revere in 2014. With an admirable cast of voice talent, and stunning animated visuals, 'The Lego Batman Movie' boasts undeniable creative talent, but does at times seem to be trying a little too hard to be funny, building off the reputation the initial film garnered.\n\nIs this film worth viewing? Most definitely, it's a hilarious feel- good animated comedy, and definitely perfect for the younger audience.

In 2014, upon the announcement of 'The Lego Movie', despite my love for the toy, I was kinda doubting the general premise. How could you make a movie out of Lego? Well, that question was soon answered as I gawped in awe at the screen, the movie was fantastic. Now, the character from 'The Lego Movie'' that garnered the most love was Batman, a cocky, sarcastic, childish take on the superhero we know and love... well it was only going to be a matter of time before he got his own motion picture.\n\n'The Lego Batman Movie' was definitely an enjoyable ride, and whilst I think it lacks in comparison to its predecessor, it stills thrusts us back into the universe that we came to revere in 2014. With an admirable cast of voice talent, and stunning animated visuals, 'The Lego Batman Movie' boasts undeniable creative talent, but does at times seem to be trying a little too hard to be funny, building off the reputation the initial film garnered.\n\nIs this film worth viewing? Most definitely, it's a hilarious feel- good animated comedy, and definitely perfect for the younger audience. I actually saw this film prior to its full release during a preview a few days early, however I believe it may have been aimed more as a kids matinée... I was literally the only adult there, shameful I know, but heck, I didn't care.

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted. This sequel comes off as a afterthought worthy to stand beside the other spinoff LEGO films, but lacks all of the magic of its predecessor.\n\nThe magic present in The LEGO Movie resides in the playful allegory of capitalism mixed with the earned nostalgia of the animation's medium. Not to mention the brilliant reveal of a child's imagination directing the entire story.

The brick civilization reverts to a Mad Max world after the invincible fat-bricked organisms regularly search and destroy anything colorful or shiny.\n\nThrough some less-than-subtle live action mirage shots early in the film, its apparent that Finn (Jadon Sand) the boy mastermind in the first film is being plagued by his younger sister Bianca (Brooklynn Prince). Her entry-level LEGO creations clash with his more involved and complex structures, and the result is a sibling pair never learning to play in symbiosis. Of course this conflict is merely implied before the lazy live action finale that resolves the paper thin dispute, and wholly lacks the gusto of the first movie's twist. The jig is already up from scene one of the sequel, because we are aware of the children's narrative dictatorship, so none of the LEGO characters' sentience ever feels authentic.\n\nChris Pratt returns to voice Emmet a happy-go-lucky construction worker who retains a life of cheer in the apocalyptic wasteland. Elizabeth Banks also reprises her role as Lucy, the brawn and brains to Emmet's fumbling optimism. Lucy desperately attempts to calibrate Emmet's persona to something more appropriate to the ruined world they now live in, but he maintains the "everything is awesome" outlook that figures problematic in a much more adult environment. In a hardly tongue-in-cheek fashion, a character outright states the thesis of the movie to be "a statement on the waning affects of adolescence on imagination." This stands as the most egregious example of "meta exploitation," but several runner ups tail close behind.\n\nFalling victim to exhausting cleverness, LEGO Movie 2 doesn't know when to edit its goofs. When you merely reformat the first film's plot to fit another child builder, new additions need to elevate the otherwise regurgitated formula. These additions include ramping up the meta meter to 11 and including two more banger tracks to hopefully burrow into the viewers' minds. The main attraction song here has a hook the repeats endlessly, "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head." Oh and I mustn't forget the cameos, which come with This is the End regularity, and if you can imagine, with far less originality.\n\nI didn't waste your time by running you down a plot synopsis for good reason. The film plays with your expectations in a cheap and unearned fashion without offering any reasonable explanation upon the conclusion other than, "We just wanted to plant red herrings, because...reasons." Screenwriters will go to great (and absurd) lengths to make an unoriginal script appear more interesting. This parasitic sequel will deliver many chuckles and feels to audiences that have already surrendered to the committee-made trajectory of the LEGO universe, but I feel somber for those choosing to double feature this lackadaisical copy with its bold predecessor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60566,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, "The Dark Knight", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, "The Dark Knight Rises"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. \n\nThe film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.\n\nAt a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies.

However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, "The Dark Knight", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, "The Dark Knight Rises"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. \n\nThe film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.\n\nAt a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum. \n\nIn conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.

Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her "typical teenager" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His "purpose" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to "move" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1106788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-10-01","keywords":"midlife crisis,adulterous wife,cheating wife,unfaithful wife,virgin girl","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi788506137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDcyNTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwNzU0NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDcyNTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwNzU0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis, decides to turn his hectic life around after developing an infatuation for his daughter's attractive friend.

His "purpose" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to "move" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1106788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-10-01","keywords":"midlife crisis,adulterous wife,cheating wife,unfaithful wife,virgin girl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi788506137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDcyNTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwNzU0NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDcyNTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwNzU0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis, decides to turn his hectic life around after developing an infatuation for his daughter's attractive friend.

Director Peter Hedges' best work is "Pieces of April", a very edgy family drama/comedy that I have recommended to many. Although "Dan in Real Life" doesn't possess anywhere near the edginess of that film, it is an entertaining film with some clever moments ... though it is much more mainstream (by design).\n\nSteve Carell stars as Dan, a widower father of three daughters. Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island. Although the film borrows material from many large family comdrams, there are a handful of moments and lines that prevent it from being a total remix. Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.\n\nCarell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick. Wouldn't call this anything close to a classic, but it is a movie families (not the youngsters) can watch together and be entertained ... nothing wrong with that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was a great movie all in all, but I feel like there's something missing. \n\nJavier Bardem played the villain fantastically, the way he spoke and acted gave you chills and made you believe that there was something beneath his facade. (I don't think it's worth mentioning that Daniel Craigs acting was good, that has already been acknowledged).\n\nAfter almost two hours in, I felt that I had so many questions unanswered and I started to worry how the movie was going to answer all of them in just half an hour. But I wasn't disappointed. Yet I was still hoping for something more, in a way.\n\nThere was just bits missing that would have made the film so much more better (even though it was great). For example getting to know more about Raoul Silvas life would have given him a stronger role in the movie. But I believe that the thing that i was the most disappointed about was Q. Bringing the character back after a few years sure brings peoples hopes up. And I was really expecting the cool gadgets that we've seen in the earlier movies. It was always fantastic to see the awesome stuff that a 007 got access to that made the spy life seem so cool. But in this movie I feel like they under-did his role a bit. A gun responding to fingerprints is cool, but the last time we saw Q, Bond got an invisible car with rocket launchers and a ring that could break glass. Sure they try to make the movies more realistic today, but I still feel that giving him a bigger role would have brought the movie up a bit.\n\nAlthough I don't want to complain to much. The movie was great, go see it, you will like it and its a bit darker side than the previous films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":659362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-10-26","keywords":"007,death of major character,official bond film,official james bond series,childhood home","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi973841433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODUxMTY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0OTI2OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODUxMTY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0OTI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her.

It was a great movie all in all, but I feel like there's something missing. \n\nJavier Bardem played the villain fantastically, the way he spoke and acted gave you chills and made you believe that there was something beneath his facade. (I don't think it's worth mentioning that Daniel Craigs acting was good, that has already been acknowledged).\n\nAfter almost two hours in, I felt that I had so many questions unanswered and I started to worry how the movie was going to answer all of them in just half an hour. But I wasn't disappointed. Yet I was still hoping for something more, in a way.\n\nThere was just bits missing that would have made the film so much more better (even though it was great). For example getting to know more about Raoul Silvas life would have given him a stronger role in the movie. But I believe that the thing that i was the most disappointed about was Q. Bringing the character back after a few years sure brings peoples hopes up. And I was really expecting the cool gadgets that we've seen in the earlier movies. It was always fantastic to see the awesome stuff that a 007 got access to that made the spy life seem so cool. But in this movie I feel like they under-did his role a bit. A gun responding to fingerprints is cool, but the last time we saw Q, Bond got an invisible car with rocket launchers and a ring that could break glass. Sure they try to make the movies more realistic today, but I still feel that giving him a bigger role would have brought the movie up a bit.\n\nAlthough I don't want to complain to much. The movie was great, go see it, you will like it and its a bit darker side than the previous films.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":659362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-10-26","keywords":"007,death of major character,official bond film,official james bond series,childhood home","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi973841433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODUxMTY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0OTI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODUxMTY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0OTI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her.

Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island.

Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.\n\nCarell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick. Wouldn't call this anything close to a classic, but it is a movie families (not the youngsters) can watch together and be entertained ... nothing wrong with that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Entertainment, as we all know, comes in different shapes and sizes; it can be smart, profound, intellectually stimulating and so forth – or it can just be escapist fun. Now what kind of entertainment you expect from a James Bond film is up to you; as for me, I go with fun. Regrettably, the last three 007 instalments fell a bit short in that department (at least for my taste), and since I expected this new film to be more of the same, I didn't exactly get my hopes up. \n\nWell, I can only say I was pleasantly surprised (although judging from most reviews here, I seem to be in the minority). Instead of further exploring the somewhat dark, dramatic route the previous three films took - which, I must admit, worked very well in Casino Royale - Spectre unexpectedly goes in the exact opposite direction. Sam Mendes and John Logan apparently came to the conclusion that it was time to bring back one of the most crucial ingredients for Bond's success with audiences over the years: the fun.\n\nDon't get me wrong; it's not suddenly ALL fun and games for Her Majesty's finest spy (and Craig still portrays him as a character driven by inner rage) - but the new film is a virtual celebration of the whole James Bond universe, from past to present, including the less grounded and over-the-top elements from the older films. In fact, after a stand-out intro sequence in classic fashion, the spy with a license to kill takes us on a ride which - tonally - feels like travelling back in time to the glory days of such classics as You Only Live Twice, Goldfinger or From Russia With Love (and it's a ride back in time in more senses than one).\n\nThis is supposed to be a spoiler-free review, so I won't go into any of the story details, but what unfolds after the introduction plays like a combination of the more grounded, serious Bond we've come to associate with Daniel Craig's films, and the more self-aware spy-romps of the Roger Moore era. It's a mix that doesn't always work and tone and pacing can be a bit uneven at times (especially during the third act), but Spectre largely succeeds in paying homage to many of the classic Bond films while still delivering the gritty action people come to expect from the newer instalments and staying true to the character Craig has so successfully made his own. And despite all the references and callbacks to classic 007 adventures, Spectre still manages to continue the storyline of the three previous films. So while his second entry in the world's longest living franchise is far from a perfect film, I believe Sam Mendes achieves exactly what he wants: he intentionally embraces the old Bond formula, but he also plays with it, twists it and introduces new story elements. \n\nSo my verdict: Spectre is a love letter to the classic Bond films, and while it might not be the masterpiece many people seem to have expected, there is a lot to enjoy here. It's a solid, almost classic Bond film with insane action, great set-pieces and a fantastic cast; upon first viewing, I'd rate it 7 stars out of 10.\n\nRare Film Gems For Cinephiles: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":409985,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-11-05","keywords":"spy,boat chase,sahara desert,secret society,kidnapping","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3362042649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjAwNDQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3NzQ5NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjAwNDQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3NzQ5NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra, the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal.

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. \n\nYou have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. \n\nEdge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. \n\nThe tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-06-04","keywords":"time loop,alien,alien invasion,dying repeatedly,combat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3591679257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier fighting in a war with aliens finds himself caught in a time loop of his last day in the battle, though he becomes better skilled along the way.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510731/","name":"Doug Liman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890871/","name":"John-Henry Butterworth"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Entertainment, as we all know, comes in different shapes and sizes; it can be smart, profound, intellectually stimulating and so forth – or it can just be escapist fun. Now what kind of entertainment you expect from a James Bond film is up to you; as for me, I go with fun. Regrettably, the last three 007 instalments fell a bit short in that department (at least for my taste), and since I expected this new film to be more of the same, I didn't exactly get my hopes up. \n\nWell, I can only say I was pleasantly surprised (although judging from most reviews here, I seem to be in the minority). Instead of further exploring the somewhat dark, dramatic route the previous three films took - which, I must admit, worked very well in Casino Royale - Spectre unexpectedly goes in the exact opposite direction. Sam Mendes and John Logan apparently came to the conclusion that it was time to bring back one of the most crucial ingredients for Bond's success with audiences over the years: the fun.\n\nDon't get me wrong; it's not suddenly ALL fun and games for Her Majesty's finest spy (and Craig still portrays him as a character driven by inner rage) - but the new film is a virtual celebration of the whole James Bond universe, from past to present, including the less grounded and over-the-top elements from the older films. In fact, after a stand-out intro sequence in classic fashion, the spy with a license to kill takes us on a ride which - tonally - feels like travelling back in time to the glory days of such classics as You Only Live Twice, Goldfinger or From Russia With Love (and it's a ride back in time in more senses than one).\n\nThis is supposed to be a spoiler-free review, so I won't go into any of the story details, but what unfolds after the introduction plays like a combination of the more grounded, serious Bond we've come to associate with Daniel Craig's films, and the more self-aware spy-romps of the Roger Moore era. It's a mix that doesn't always work and tone and pacing can be a bit uneven at times (especially during the third act), but Spectre largely succeeds in paying homage to many of the classic Bond films while still delivering the gritty action people come to expect from the newer instalments and staying true to the character Craig has so successfully made his own. And despite all the references and callbacks to classic 007 adventures, Spectre still manages to continue the storyline of the three previous films. So while his second entry in the world's longest living franchise is far from a perfect film, I believe Sam Mendes achieves exactly what he wants: he intentionally embraces the old Bond formula, but he also plays with it, twists it and introduces new story elements. \n\nSo my verdict: Spectre is a love letter to the classic Bond films, and while it might not be the masterpiece many people seem to have expected, there is a lot to enjoy here. It's a solid, almost classic Bond film with insane action, great set-pieces and a fantastic cast; upon first viewing, I'd rate it 7 stars out of 10.\n\nRare Film Gems For Cinephiles: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":409985,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-11-05","keywords":"spy,boat chase,sahara desert,secret society,kidnapping","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3362042649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjAwNDQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3NzQ5NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjAwNDQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU3NzQ5NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra, the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal.

U režiji stanovnika Ojaia i filmaša Michaela Milana, ovaj kratki osobni dokumentarac sastoji se od snimaka požara i intervjua onih najteže pogođenih. Milano, koji je dokumentirao i utjecaj požara na svoju obitelj, prati stanovnike koji su pretrpjeli vatreno uništenje svojih domova i lokala, kao i napore grada u pomoći i izgradnji. Na kraju, OJAI U PLAMENU naglašava otpornost stanovnika okruga Ventura u vrijeme kad prijetnja kalifornijskih požara ne pokazuje znakove opadanja.</desc>

A certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell's character is the one everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the "A" story you wonder why and start to think that the "B" story is going to be muddled or cliché or one to endure. Well, they're not and everything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast here is perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn't matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":493113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-29","keywords":"divorce,marriage,unfaithfulness,adultery,marital problem","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3722091801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTY2NzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNDg4NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Newly single Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is taken on as wingman and protÃ©gÃ© to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).

But I do usually see them because the originals are good. Checking this out in theaters for me didn't require any trailers, because its based on the Harry Potter universe. What's not to like about that?\n\nThis film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.\n\nFor the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.\n\nThe visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the "fantastic" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.\n\nAfter the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":429975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-11-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,suitcase,based on novel,magical creature","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1553839641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519666/","name":"Eddie Redmayne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0837223/","name":"Alison Sudol"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946734/","name":"David Yates"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

Liz Ortecho ostavila je svoj rodni gradić Roswell u Novom Meksiku prije 10 godina, nakon smrti voljene starije sestre. No kako joj je otac bolestan, ona se nevoljko vraća u turistički gradić kako bi se doselila k njemu. Kada Liz stigne, ponovno se poveže s Maxom Evansom, svojom tinejdžerskom ljubavi koji je sada policajac u Roswellu. Njihova je kemija odmah električna. No Liz uskoro otkriva šokantnu istinu: Max je izvanzemaljac koji je skrivao svoje nezemaljske sposobnosti cijeli život, zajedno s onima svog izvanzemaljskog brata i sestre, Isobel i Michaela. Kako se njih dvoje zbližavaju nakon deset godina razdvojenosti, Liz je sve teže skrivati istinu od svoje najbolje prijateljice Marije De Luce i pouzdanog bivšeg dečka iz srednje škole, dr.

The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nThe movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.\n\nEven though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. \n\nIn fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one.

The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nThe movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.\n\nEven though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. \n\nIn fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, "The Iron Giant", which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.\n\nRATING: ***** out of *****.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":683546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2005-01-05","keywords":"superhero family,superhero,non comic book superhero,secret identity,cgi animation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredibles: Blu-ray Release","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963250457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk2ZmY4MTMtZDRmNy00YWM1LThmZWUtMWM3ZmViNzA3ZjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk2ZmY4MTMtZDRmNy00YWM1LThmZWUtMWM3ZmViNzA3ZjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"New Nomanisan Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005266/","name":"Craig T.

KAD PADNE MRAK u dokumentarnom stilu prikazuje svakodnevan (odnosno, svakonoćni) život troje vampira koji zajedno "žive" stotinama godina. Na Staten Islandu. Samoproglašeni vođa grupe je "Nandor Nemilosrdni", veliki ratnik i osvajač iz Osmanskog carstva. Zatim je tu britanski vampir "Laszlo" - pomalo vucibatina, dendi i kicoš, da se poslužimo njegovim riječima. A tu je i "Nadja": zavodnica, napasnica, vampirska Bonnie Laszloovom Clydeu. Nakon neočekivanog posjeta njihova mračnog gospodara i vođe, "Baruna Afanasa", vampire se podsjeća na njihov primarni zadatak koji su dobili kada su stigli na Staten Island prije više od stotinu godina - potpuna i cjelovita dominacija nad Novim svijetom. Ali koji je zapravo najbolji način za ostvarenje takve dominacije?</desc>

The score was perfection, creating the perfect tension and suspense. This film was actor Devon Graye's first screenplay, and he hit it out of the ballpark. Some of the twists were certainly over the top and there were some plot and technical issues, but for an amateur screenwriter, he did better than some recent seasoned writers' films I've seen lately. In comparison, his writing was genius. The 96 min runtime was perfect, but I felt the start was too slow and the ending too fast. I would've liked to have seen more even pacing. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it and my head is still spinning from the plot twists. I'm definitely going to see it again.

All casting and performances were spot-on, with the exception of Helen Hunt, who seemed spaced-put and truly on all those pills she was popping. The score was perfection, creating the perfect tension and suspense. This film was actor Devon Graye's first screenplay, and he hit it out of the ballpark. Some of the twists were certainly over the top and there were some plot and technical issues, but for an amateur screenwriter, he did better than some recent seasoned writers' films I've seen lately. In comparison, his writing was genius. The 96 min runtime was perfect, but I felt the start was too slow and the ending too fast. I would've liked to have seen more even pacing. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it and my head is still spinning from the plot twists. I'm definitely going to see it again. A well deserved 9/10 from me","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43209,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-12-10","keywords":"phrogging,kidnapping,infidelity,murder,home invasion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2866921241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2NmY5MmMtNTgxMC00OWFhLTk1NGMtNzk4M2EwZDQxNTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2NmY5MmMtNTgxMC00OWFhLTk1NGMtNzk4M2EwZDQxNTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000166/","name":"Helen Hunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0855103/","name":"Jon Tenney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4977122/","name":"Owen Teague"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1726691/","name":"Adam Randall"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121295/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0493361/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362154/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1984458/","name":"Devon Graye"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The makers of the show took issues and aspects of long standing science fiction, added a new twist and location, and a ton of humour, creating in the process a fun new show that both amuses and mystifies.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed seeing science fiction elements that have been proved interesting, stimulating, and well liked in the past. Throughout it all, while not too much language was used that I consider far above my own understanding, it still gave me the impression of "Hmmm... They know what they are talking about. Maybe some of this really is possible." I love that about television shows.\n\nLeaving behind the sci fi subject matter, I was also impressed with the acting within and writing of the show. The pilot showed a serious side, with veins of humour throughout. The acting showed great compatibility and believability of the characters. I found myself liking some characters and getting annoyed at others. I love being drawn into a show like that.\n\nAlthough some things can be considered predictable, and indeed I guessed a number of things before they happened or were revealed, I was still held in suspense and laughing from beginning to end.

STOP, read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.\n\nThis was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously   AND   it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them   you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.\n\nSiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.\n\nOverall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film   the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"football","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shaolin Soccer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550542873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955505/","name":"Wei Zhao"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939431/","name":"Yat-Fei Wong"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0302241/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032768/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298676/","name":"Min-Hun Fung"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.\n\nSiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.\n\nOverall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film   the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"football","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shaolin Soccer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550542873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955505/","name":"Wei Zhao","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939431/","name":"Yat-Fei Wong"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0302241/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032768/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298676/","name":"Min-Hun Fung"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\n\nThis film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\n\n Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

STOP, read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.\n\nThis was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously   AND   it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them   you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.\n\nSiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.\n\nOverall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film   the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"football","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shaolin Soccer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550542873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955505/","name":"Wei Zhao"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939431/","name":"Yat-Fei Wong"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0302241/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032768/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298676/","name":"Min-Hun Fung"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

STOP, read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.\n\nThis was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously   AND   it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them   you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.\n\nSiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers.

This was better than I thought it would be. I even put off watching it for awhile because I did not have very high hopes for it, but it turned out pretty decent.\n\nGary Sinise plays Spencer Olham, a doctor along with his wife, Maya, played by Madeleine Stowe. Spencer wakes up and goes to work the next morning to find that he is a wanted man. It appears that the military and the U.S. Defense department think that he is actually a cyborg with a bomb placed in it's heart, with a mission to kill the Chancellor! Pretty far out stuff. The visuals explaining this were pretty cool, too.\n\nSpencer manages to escape but always has the military hot on his trail. This is where the mystery comes in. The viewer is forced to wonder whether or not Spencer is actually himself, or the cyborg programmed to be Spencer. The movie does an excellent job of placing doubt in the minds of those watching, no matter which way they are leaning. If they think Spencer is really himself, it still makes you wonder. Major Hathaway, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, claims that the cyborg is merely programmed to act human, as if it really wants to live.\n\nThe special effects here are pretty good as well. At the beginning, I thought we would have another Starship Troopers (visually) on our hands. Since the story takes place in the year 2079, it would not be a good science fiction without the cool household gadgets and such. We see plenty of that here, especially in the beginning. Parts of the movie reminded me of I, Robot, Demolition Man and at times, even Star Wars.

Well the latter should rather try to enjoy as much as possible. Because the science behind it all does not really mix well together. A problem that the movie is not alone with. Mingling with time and trying to make it plausible is almost impossible. Just a few have managed to get the "technical" things right or rather the things right that would seem logical.\n\nBut throw logic out of the window, because this is about teenagers. And while you get the obvious "what would you change, if you could" discussion, in the end it all boils down to personal advantage (mostly). And can you blame them? The twist at the end is kind of redundant, but it's there and better than the alternate endings that can be watched on the disc/special features.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":318968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none.
