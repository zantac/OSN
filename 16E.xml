"Secret Window," the novel, is about a man whose wife cheats on him. Fueled by rage, the fictional character murders his own wife and buries her in the "secret garden" located outside of the "secret window" of their home.\n\nIt is said that art imitates life, and through a series of flashbacks we learn that Mort's novel bears an eerie similarity to his own problems -- "six months ago" his wife (Maria Bello) had an affair with Ted (Timothy Hutton).

In the opening scenes we see the President's daughter, Alexandra (Taylor Momsen from "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), as a special guest at a futuristic amusement park. When Alexandra gets herself in trouble on a ride called the Juggler (which actually juggles the cars containing the passengers!), Carmen and Juni are dispatched to help her. But then a backup Spy Kids team of Gary (Matt O'Leary from "Frailty") and Gerti (Emily Osment, sister of Haley Joel) Giggles are sent in as well. The situation becomes competitive, with the Cortezes rescuing Alexandra while the Giggleses retrieve the dangerous device (the Transmooger) that she had stolen from her father's office.\n\nAs in the first film, Carmen and Juni's parents are Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino), who are also spies working for OSS. Gregorio is up for a major promotion, but like his children, he is also competing with the Giggles family. The dinner at which the winner of this promotion is announced is the launching pad for the heart of the film.\n\nOther key characters returning from the first film are uncle "Machete" Cortez (Danny Trejo) and Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin). And then there is Doctor Romero (Steve Buscemi), who is a very interesting character.\n\nThe "film" was actually shot using high definition video, which looked good enough to never be a distraction. It had been transferred to film for exhibition, so the normal film wear and tear issues applied, especially since I saw it near the tail end of its theatrical run.\n\nBesides using digital video, the director (Robert Rodriguez) also used another trick to save money: he did almost everything himself. He was the writer, cinematographer, editor, production designer, and visual effects supervisor, and also helped produce and score the film. Apparently he did much of this work in his garage in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe first film was very fun and unexpected. This one feels a *little* too much like more of the same, and it also adds a touch more gross humor than I think it needed to. It's still fun and definitely worth at least a rental, but it's not *quite* up to the level of the first film.\n\nSeen on 10/9/2002.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65001,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-12-25","keywords":"machete cortez character,close up of eye,espionage,good versus evil,close up of eyes","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3814195481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT#3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891786/","name":"Alexa PenaVega"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754512/","name":"Daryl Sabara"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035848/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the opening scenes we see the President's daughter, Alexandra (Taylor Momsen from "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), as a special guest at a futuristic amusement park. When Alexandra gets herself in trouble on a ride called the Juggler (which actually juggles the cars containing the passengers!), Carmen and Juni are dispatched to help her. But then a backup Spy Kids team of Gary (Matt O'Leary from "Frailty") and Gerti (Emily Osment, sister of Haley Joel) Giggles are sent in as well. The situation becomes competitive, with the Cortezes rescuing Alexandra while the Giggleses retrieve the dangerous device (the Transmooger) that she had stolen from her father's office.\n\nAs in the first film, Carmen and Juni's parents are Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino), who are also spies working for OSS. Gregorio is up for a major promotion, but like his children, he is also competing with the Giggles family. The dinner at which the winner of this promotion is announced is the launching pad for the heart of the film.\n\nOther key characters returning from the first film are uncle "Machete" Cortez (Danny Trejo) and Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin). And then there is Doctor Romero (Steve Buscemi), who is a very interesting character.\n\nThe "film" was actually shot using high definition video, which looked good enough to never be a distraction. It had been transferred to film for exhibition, so the normal film wear and tear issues applied, especially since I saw it near the tail end of its theatrical run.\n\nBesides using digital video, the director (Robert Rodriguez) also used another trick to save money: he did almost everything himself. He was the writer, cinematographer, editor, production designer, and visual effects supervisor, and also helped produce and score the film. Apparently he did much of this work in his garage in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe first film was very fun and unexpected. This one feels a *little* too much like more of the same, and it also adds a touch more gross humor than I think it needed to. It's still fun and definitely worth at least a rental, but it's not *quite* up to the level of the first film.\n\nSeen on 10/9/2002.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65001,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-12-25","keywords":"machete cortez character,close up of eye,espionage,good versus evil,close up of eyes","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3814195481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT#3","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891786/","name":"Alexa PenaVega","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754512/","name":"Daryl Sabara","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035848/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is having an affair with his best friend's wife, Amanda. His best friend, Earl, knows about this, however. Thus he kills himself one day, and cleverly frames Clay for the murder. Clay, feeling both afraid and awkward, covers this incident up by making the death look like a suicide. The police fall for it and Clay puts this mess behind him. This film, both written and directed by newcomer David Dobkin, is the most original movie I have seen in a long while. Think about it, we haven't had a movie this clever and blackly comic since "Fargo," possible one of the best movies I have ever scene. The characters are so unique, while they don't generate much sympathy from the audience; they still are extremely fun to watch.\n\nThe performances are another great element in the movie. Vince Vaughn portrays Lester Long like he did in the recent "Psycho" remake. His style, giggle, attitude, and presence are all priceless. Joaquin Phoenix takes us though a funny joyride as he gets into more and more trouble as Clay. Let's not forget Georgina Cates, as the slutty wife of Earl. She plays cocky character who everyone loves to hate. The only character I could find is Janeane Garofalo's, who was surly inspired by Frances MacDormand from "Fargo."\n\nThe film's soundtrack is of the best there is, with songs that not only further the character's motives, but are also catchy and even describe some of the movie's plot at times. I have owned the soundtrack even before I saw the movie, which is quite unusual. But once I heard the theme song to "Clay Pigeons": "The Ballad of Lester Long," I had to get it.\n\n I do think that this movie could have been better, however. If it had left a few more elements to the imagination, like the guilt or innocence of Clay Birdwell, and the explicit murder and sex scenes, maybe the viewer would be l bit more involved into the story. A little less plot and a little fewer characters would have also been nice.\n\nBut those are but minor complaints. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time, and I was not that disappointed. "Clay Pigeons" is one of the years most entertaining and original films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1998-09-25","keywords":"anal sex,strong female character,murder of a nude woman,female nudity,nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Clay Pigeons","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982019353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRkMjc1YmQtN2NhMy00YWZmLWI5NTctMDNjMDAyOGIyOWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRkMjc1YmQtN2NhMy00YWZmLWI5NTctMDNjMDAyOGIyOWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from PolyGram Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001618/","name":"Joaquin Phoenix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000681/","name":"Vince Vaughn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000413/","name":"Janeane Garofalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0229694/","name":"David Dobkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176825/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071425/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372356/","name":"Matthew L.

It's a football comedy, plain and simple.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169833,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-08-10","keywords":"frame up,scantily clad female,voyeur,voyeurism,football helmet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Longest Yard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi821428505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781842/","name":"Peter Segal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748665/","name":"Albert S.

    <desc lang="hr">Twins: Directed by Ivan Reitman. With Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito, Kelly Preston, Chloe Webb. A physically perfect but innocent man goes in search of his long-lost twin brother, who is short, a womanizer, and small-time crook." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0096320/","name":"Twins","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUzN2VkY2ItYmQ4YS00MjFmLWJhZDQtYWY1NWQ2NTA5NDNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDc2NjEyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A physically perfect but innocent man goes in search of his long-lost twin brother, who is short, a womanizer, and small-time crook.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0096320/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ElMaruecan82"},"dateCreated":"2019-10-20","inLanguage":"English","name":"Danny and Arnie... or when comedies had warmth and innocence.","reviewBody":"1953, a super-secret scientific experiment aims to make a perfect man out of six "contributors" who include Nobel Prize winners and athletes and a beautiful woman to be inoculated with the seminal milkshake. But as usual when men play sorcerer apprentices, science finds its way to trick them and when the super-baby raises his cute little nose, it's revealed a few seconds later that Mommy carried a clandestine passenger all along.\n\nLife found a way in a little boy who's nothing like his big brother is (literally) and there comes another comedy relying on science and the mysteries of life from Ivan Reitman, after "Ghosbusters" and before "Junior". The title shot says it all, the big blonde baby is Arnold Schwarzenegger and the little one who kicks him in the leg is Danny De Vito, such a cute and tender moment for a blockbuster comedy... because it's a comedy. Boys separated at birth and reuniting for a vengeance has been an excuse for lousy action pictures but who needs action when characters are driven by family love.\n\nWhat "Twins" accomplishes is remarkable in its simplicity, it takes the established comedic persona of Danny De Vito and associates it to one no viewer would have anticipated in 1988. Consider that in '87, Arnie had played one of his ultimate action roles in "Predator" and it was right after "Terminator", "Commando" and the "Conan" series. Just when he was about to be typecast, Arnie takes a 180° turn and plays a man who's strong and muscular all right but never at the expenses of his good nature, his endless love for his brother and his nerdy attributes. Remember that McBain gag in "The Simpsons" where he played a nerd, it's a credit for Arnie to never make his Julius Benedict a similar subject of ridicule, he's genuinely funny because he never means to. For the same reason, even the preposterous premise of having him pregnant in "Junior" worked beautifully.\n\nBut "Twins" accomplishes something more, it pairs up the most two different possible actors, body and personality-wise to make it part of the plot, it's one thing to make them brothers, but talk about suspension of disbelief when we're asked to believe they're twins. That's the stuff comedic gold can be made of and in the crucial moment where Julius reveals his identity to Vincent, from each sides of a visiting room, Vincent's reaction is priceless: "it was like looking in the mirror", "we're not identical twins" retorts Julius and Vincent's face is another credit to De Vito's talent, it says "oh that explains it all" with a hint of "no kidding?". And apart from a few moments that insist on their telepathic connections (scratching their bottom in the same time, Vincent naming his cat Julius and Julius naming his computer Vincent) the film never overplays it to the point it becomes a cheap gimmick, and in the 80s, it's quite an achievement.\n\nI guess that's the third accomplishment of "Twins", it has a deep and touching warmth of its own that plays like a wonderful tribute to brotherhood that transcends the differences. Danny and Arnie share the screen literally as they never try to steal one scene from another. And when Julius tries to follow his brothers' steps: how to make up with girls, how to flirt, to dance, to prepare for the big night (because Julius is a virgin) it's funny and goofy but it's played with balance by Arnie who's got a lot of comedic potential, certainly more than his rival Stallone. I criticized Sly for being too "straight" even in comedic roles such as "Demolition Man", but that same year, Arnie delivered a great self-parodic performance in "Last Action Hero" and hints of that truetalent is displayed in "Twins". Take that scene when he's teased by the beautiful Kelly Preston, he knows he is but he plays his Julius as an embarrassed man, never embarrassing. Naturally, she stops playing with him and takes full rein.\n\n"Twins" contains two romances, Arnie and Preston while De Vito is with the more jovial and ordinary-looking Chloe Webb and together they have a great chemistry. Heart is something that never deserts the film and contributes to some weirdly effective serious moments, Julius' childish joy meeting the athletic dad, Vincent learning that he was the undeserved one by the doctor prick followed by the heartwarming moment when Julius comforts him by reminding him that it's not just a matter of nature but nurture as well, he lived in a Pacific Island surrounded by love while he grew up in an orphanage thinking his mom abandoned him.\n\nIt's all natural that one brother would learn the tricks of modern life and the other to be a little less rough when it comes to handle the sweet aspects of life. Isolated they were alone and marginal, together they form a great duo immortalized by that iconic moment where they cockily walk across the street with the same suit, certainly one of the 80's most instantly identifiable moments. Of course, the crime plot is here to give some spice to the narrative but it never indulges to the basic clichés, no chase, no shootouts, and Arnie is only strong when necessary but despises violence. It all comes down to the real climax of the film not being about action or money but a magical reunion between a mother and her lost sons.\n\n"Twins" takes me back to the early 90s when Saturdays evening featured comedies and comedies of that era had such an innocence I truly miss them (though Kelly Preston awakened one of my earliest pre-teen impulses and her presence is one of the things I most cherish about the film).\n\n(and for the first time, I post the 100th review of a film)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1988-12-09","keywords":"brother,long lost siblings,new mexico,lost mother,desert island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Twins","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1205862681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjZGQ1ODktZWM5Yi00ZGU4LWIzMzQtZjNhM2M5Y2Y1M2IxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjZGQ1ODktZWM5Yi00ZGU4LWIzMzQtZjNhM2M5Y2Y1M2IxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000362/","name":"Danny DeVito"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000593/","name":"Kelly Preston"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718645/","name":"Ivan Reitman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651758/","name":"William Osborne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365390/","name":"Timothy Harris"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The twist at the end is one you didn't know to begin with but then you're like "omg totally makes sense now". This series is a fun one to watch, all the blood and gore.

The government can't tax it. Yet sports betting is a $200 billion a year business. A business that strives to exploit every vulnerability, manipulate every gullibility, and convince the client that it can provide them certainty in an uncertain world.\n\nTwo for the Money is the story of one man's journey into the sports gambling world. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his more impressive performances as he transforms from Brandon Lang, the smooth-talking golden boy, into John Anthony - "The Million Dollar Man with the Billion Dollar Plan." A transformation that comes complete with a new suit, a new car, a new attitude, and slicked back hair - a sure-fire movie sign that corruption or a loss of innocence is imminent.\n\nPortraying a character that must deal with this corruption of innocence, McConaughey demonstrates that he can act with more than just his dimples and down-home Southern charm. Lang is a machine. He knows the teams, the leagues, the players, the game. All he does is work out and pick winners, two facts made abundantly clear by McConaughey's propensity to walk around shirtless just as often as he makes football picks. I may have rolled my eyes once or twice, but I heard nary a complaint from the ladies in the audience. Except for that one that looked a little like my Uncle Larry.\n\nLang's corruption rests solely on the fragile shoulders of Walter Abrams, a sleazy character played so effortlessly by Al Pacino that you can't help but feel slightly disturbed by the ease with which he seems capable of tainting ambitious young men. Screaming less than usual, Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of an indictment of those sports advisors who feed on the weak. Sports gambling may be illegal in 46 states, but Abrams is well aware that "sports advising" (the politically correct preference, no doubt) is not. Despite the false promise of certainty, sports advising is presented as more used car salesmanship than mathematical study. Figure out your client's needs, and get his money. That's the name of the game. As for actually picking a winner? It's 50-50. A flip of the coin.\n\nSure, Lang is able to compile a pretty impressive hot streak, but what happens when it comes to a crashing halt? The peaks are indeed very high when the fun and money are flowing, but is it worth the lesson learned when your family is threatened and you're hit with the realization of what losing $380,000 can do to a family? \n\nUltimately, the movie would have proved more effective if there had been a greater emphasis on the devastation of the lows of losing. Consequences are touched but never fully realized. I would have also liked less predictability in a movie about a very unpredictable lifestyle, but Two for the Money still succeeds in giving the audience a glimpse of what gets in the minds of those willing to gamble. Is it about the game? Is it about the money? Or, as Abrams believes, is it about the risk some people are willing to take to feel what they perceive as being alive?\n\nThe dialogue and character interaction happen at a quick enough pace to grab and seal your attention, and while the last act is somewhat weighed down by the two-hour runtime and the semi-sappy melodrama of plans gone awry, Money still manages to convince the audience to care about whether or not Brandon can get back to where he began - the purity of the game.\n\nYou want certainty in an uncertain world? Then put your money on obligatory shirtless Matthew McConaughey scenes and Pacino's incisors getting a nice scene-chewing workout. It's a safer bet than trusting your money with the decision-making of those who care more about the profit than they do about you.\n\nTHE GIST \n\nTwo for the Money will prove to be most enjoyable to those with some familiarity or interest with sports and the gambling side of the business. But McConaughey and Pacino deliver enough laughs and energy to make this more accessible to those with little knowledge of the subject matter.

How their imagination is shaped. Sometimes it is beautiful. Sometimes it stays beautiful and by not changing loses its luster. Then you have guys like Tykwer. He develops. He tries new moves. He thinks deeply about film. He's the guy who reimagined "Rashomon." He's the fellow who stood with Cate Blanchett looking as Kieslowski with a Kieslowski script by God! \n\nHe made a film based on sight as smell, and recently one on cinematic sight through blindness.\n\nNow he makes an action movie with, guess what? No sex, no car chase, no fight on the top of a train, no gasoline explosions. And he doesn't rely on that newspaper notion of "a thinking man's thriller," because he deliberately makes the template so ordinary it fades from view. It hardly matters that there is a bank involved. Its all about that vanilla bugaboo, the conspiracy that compromises the authorities and (usually) involves arms. Really, the story disappears.\n\nWhat we are left with is an amazing use of context. I've seen James Bond, Jason Bourne and Laura Croft traipse through famous cities, but their beings are never affected. Tykwer, I surmise, saw this as an opportunity to do a Kieslowski with cities instead of rooms. Look at what he does, its an entirely environmental film. Its not quite enough, but if you are there already, its sublime.\n\nWhat else? Well, test audiences did not get it, so there was a scene replaced, the one in the Guggenheim. If you have ever been in that building it is remarkable. Its a failure, an intrusive imposition. You can see where Frank knew that corners were bad, but he so mismanages the eye that you retreat into the art, or try too. Its an amazing, disturbing experience. Tykwer exploits the very things about this space that make it so unnerving.\n\nHe pretty much gleefully trashes it. This one scene, added after the movie was finished, makes the whole adventure worthwhile. \n\nIf you know architectural cinema, you'll know it was invented by Welles and depends on planes and corners. These are absent here. We have a new method, a new eye.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-02-18","keywords":"interpol,money laundering,post punk,lyon france,milan italy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The International: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi815137561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Interpol Agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) pool their resources in an attempt to break up an international arms dealing ring financed by a high-profile bank."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028338/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2545235/","name":"Eric Warren Singer"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He thinks deeply about film. He's the guy who reimagined "Rashomon." He's the fellow who stood with Cate Blanchett looking as Kieslowski with a Kieslowski script by God! \n\nHe made a film based on sight as smell, and recently one on cinematic sight through blindness.\n\nNow he makes an action movie with, guess what? No sex, no car chase, no fight on the top of a train, no gasoline explosions. And he doesn't rely on that newspaper notion of "a thinking man's thriller," because he deliberately makes the template so ordinary it fades from view. It hardly matters that there is a bank involved. Its all about that vanilla bugaboo, the conspiracy that compromises the authorities and (usually) involves arms. Really, the story disappears.\n\nWhat we are left with is an amazing use of context. I've seen James Bond, Jason Bourne and Laura Croft traipse through famous cities, but their beings are never affected. Tykwer, I surmise, saw this as an opportunity to do a Kieslowski with cities instead of rooms. Look at what he does, its an entirely environmental film. Its not quite enough, but if you are there already, its sublime.\n\nWhat else? Well, test audiences did not get it, so there was a scene replaced, the one in the Guggenheim. If you have ever been in that building it is remarkable. Its a failure, an intrusive imposition. You can see where Frank knew that corners were bad, but he so mismanages the eye that you retreat into the art, or try too. Its an amazing, disturbing experience. Tykwer exploits the very things about this space that make it so unnerving.\n\nHe pretty much gleefully trashes it. This one scene, added after the movie was finished, makes the whole adventure worthwhile. \n\nIf you know architectural cinema, you'll know it was invented by Welles and depends on planes and corners. These are absent here. We have a new method, a new eye.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-02-18","keywords":"interpol,money laundering,post punk,lyon france,milan italy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The International: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi815137561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Interpol Agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) pool their resources in an attempt to break up an international arms dealing ring financed by a high-profile bank.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028338/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2545235/","name":"Eric Warren Singer"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, as Penenberg starts to look at the facts behind the story he starts to suspect that the story is one large fabrication.\n\nI only vaguely remember the original breaking of this story and am not aware of the full facts behind the story but I was interested enough to go and see this film when it was released at the weekend. The film opens with Glass giving a talk to a class back at his old school where he learnt his trade, this is then used as a tool to give background on both him and the job he does. This works pretty well even if it is a little confusing as to when it is happening (a fact not understood until the end). The main thrust of the film is the gradual exposure of the lies that Glass has been perpetrated within his stories. In this regard it works pretty well as a drama with a good story  made all the more interesting and engaging by being true. It never really ignites into being a thriller and it misses a few opportunities to really be gripping but it still performs well as a good solid film  perhaps it was a decision not to stick in more shouting or acting fireworks, it was the right decision but I'm sure some audiences will expect shouting and fireworks.\n\nThe one moment I did feel that the film missed out was where Chuck picks several editions off the shelf and starts to realize the extent of the lies that they have been publishing: that scene wasn't dramatic and it wasn't convincing, that should have been a lot more dramatic  but this is only one scene in the whole film. Like I said, some people will find this film a bit slow and lacking in pace but for me it was the story that drove the film as opposed to theatrical tricks. The cast help the film a great deal, even if many of them are barely more than cameos. Christensen's performance worried me at the start because it seemed to be a bit cheesy but after 15 minutes I realized that this was the point. His Glass is manipulative and deceitful to the point where it is an act that he delivers naturally  it was a difficult character to do and, despite him not being showy, he gets it bang on and he delivers the same character throughout while just allowing the audience's perception of him to change. Sarsgaard actually turns out to have the lion's share of the film and he gets the showiest moments of shouting  he is good and acts as our eyes. Sevingy is a real good actress and does well with her few scenes. The rest of the cast is well padded with famous faces who all deliver well with the little they have. Azaria is good and is given a good character (who died in real life covering the war in Iraq), Zahn manages to not be an annoying pr*ck  a feat in itself, but Dawson's presence was a mystery to me. She has very little to do other that be pretty and show the pressure in her job, but he is barely more than a cameo.\n\nOverall this film lacks fireworks and bases it's slow pace on the facts of the true story and not hammy acting or directing flourishes.

Not the film that Saturday night crowds will be hoping for but a good story well told nonetheless.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2003-11-26","keywords":"fabricated facts,journalistic fraud,writer,magazine,journalist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shattered Glass","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1955004697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyNjJjMzEtNmZjMC00NjBjLWJmZjMtOGRjODM1MzYxZmY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyNjJjMzEtNmZjMC00NjBjLWJmZjMtOGRjODM1MzYxZmY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Lionsgate","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159789/","name":"Hayden Christensen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001721/","name":"Chloë Sevigny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001872/","name":"Steve Zahn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094885/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084334/","name":"Buzz Bissinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I use "his film" in the most liberal sense here, as star Mel Gibson wrestled control of the film from Helgeland and imposed his own view on the final editing process. With this situation in mind, I fully expected "A Knight's Tale" to be a creative response to that negative filmmaking experience, a fun and free film that thumbed its nose at tradition and set style and which allowed the director's true vision to shine through with no outside interference. And my friends, that's exactly what I got when I first sat down to watch in back in 2001. "A Knight's Tale" celebrates the classic and vastly misused/underused genre of medieval movies, while at the same time knocking the genre on its ear by instilling the film with modern themes, attitudes and a classic rock score. Sadly, it was these elements which repelled most viewers and led to "A Knight's Tale's" lackluster performance at the box office. Were these people just a little more open minded, they would have allowed themselves a wonderful movie-going experience that celebrates individuality, love, and above all else, friendship. Though the music is crucial to the uniqueness of this film (and a brilliant addition, I might add), it's the relationships amongst the characters that gives this film its heart. William and Jocelyn are the perfect couple: bickering, floundering, and absolutely in love with one another. Wat, Roland, Kate and Geoff, wonderful characters unwilling to be fopped off as simple comic reliefs, show genuine love and loyalty to William, and do as much to contribute and carry the story along as William and the other two leads accomplish. Count Adamar, the film's villain, is a wonderful foil for William. He is cunning and cruel, and even in his moments of defeat, a character to respect. In many cases, such a villain would be made to seem wimpy or, at his moment of defeat, clumsy. Not so here, as Adamar is, throughout the film, a force to be reckoned with. I suppose part of why I love "A Knight's Tale" is my ability to relate to it so personally. I've certainly had my share of challenges, and aspired to be more than what I currently was. And I've also known friendships so loyal and loving that fiction could never invent. Most significantly, I've lived the pursuit of true love and, like William, have obtained it with no small amount of satisfaction. Everyone to some degree or another has also had these experiences in their lives, and its these experiences that built the foundation of "A Knight's Tale," which is exactly what makes it such a wonderful film, more than worthy of a second chance by those who previously doubted it, and much more than worthy of a spot in any fan's movie collection."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179192,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-24","keywords":"medieval times,knight,jousting,london england,chaucer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Knight's Tale","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2427715865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxMzRmODYtOTRmMy00ZjQwLTk4MjAtNDQ5YjQ2NTZjZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxMzRmODYtOTRmMy00ZjQwLTk4MjAtNDQ5YjQ2NTZjZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005132/","name":"Heath Ledger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004692/","name":"Mark Addy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001722/","name":"Rufus Sewell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035535/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031304/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland"}],"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Black Hawk Down: Directed by Ridley Scott. With Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana.

Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.\n\nFor whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After "stirring up the hornet's nest", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, "Leave No Man Behind".\n\nNeedless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells "RPG's!" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.\n\nWhile the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.\n\nIt's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play "Dead Somali with a Gun #354".\n\nAlthough characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.\n\nAs expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.\n\nA big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.\n\nIn a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.\n\nRating: 10 out of 10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":378101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. army,gunfight,peacekeeper,chaos","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.\n\nAs expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.\n\nA big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.\n\nIn a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.\n\nRating: 10 out of 10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":378101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. army,gunfight,peacekeeper,chaos","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Although I cannot give examples, imagine a lower school level story line with sci fi effects made by Michael Bay, add in some really weird elements of homosexuality, adultery, and kungfu and tadaaaaa.\n\nDo not watch, as the saying goes "if people tell you something looks and smells like poop so many times, you seriously don't need to eat it", so DO NOT WATCH IT.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1690,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action"],"datePublished":"2015-07-03","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Monk Comes Down the Mountain","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1449639705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRhYmQyNTMtZmY0OC00ZDM0LWI5NTQtNWI4OTI3ZGU4YjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRhYmQyNTMtZmY0OC00ZDM0LWI5NTQtNWI4OTI3ZGU4YjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1316170/","name":"Baoqiang Wang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0508554/","name":"Xuejian Li","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1981215/","name":"Wei Fan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0155280/","name":"Kaige Chen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0155280/","name":"Kaige Chen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4192630/","name":"Haofeng Xu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3358264/","name":"Ting Zhang"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Quarantine 2 was not a movie I had my heart on seeing, basically because I didn't think it could live up to the standard of its predecessor (or the Spanish original.) On that count, I was right. This isn't as good as the first movie. Having said that, one of my tests for any horror movie is whether it has the ability to scare you and make you jump. This one does that, so I have to call it a good movie. It has a lot of chills and jump out of your seat moments, my wife actually screamed at least twice that I recall. It works, in other words. That fright quality isn't as sustained as it is in the first movie, though. In fact, this is pretty slow off the top. A few people board an airplane and they're not feeling too well. If you've seen the first movie, then you know what's happening (or, more to the point, what's going to happen) so you're basically just waiting for it.\n\nOne thing that I noted was that the events of this movie were taking place at the same time as the events of Quarantine. In fact, one of the airplane passengers is using the airplane's wifi to watch a news broadcast about the quarantined building in Los Angeles. While the disease and its effects are pretty much the same, there's more of an effort made here to get to the background and origins of the disease, which is really dealt with only in a few hints toward the end of Quarantine.\n\nQuarantine (and Rec) are filmed in a "Blair Witch" style - hand held cameras recording the action as it takes place. Quarantine 2 takes a more standard approach to movie-making. I think the hand held camera idea has been done to death, quite frankly, so I didn't miss it.

Quarantine 2 was not a movie I had my heart on seeing, basically because I didn't think it could live up to the standard of its predecessor (or the Spanish original.) On that count, I was right. This isn't as good as the first movie. Having said that, one of my tests for any horror movie is whether it has the ability to scare you and make you jump. This one does that, so I have to call it a good movie. It has a lot of chills and jump out of your seat moments, my wife actually screamed at least twice that I recall. It works, in other words. That fright quality isn't as sustained as it is in the first movie, though. In fact, this is pretty slow off the top. A few people board an airplane and they're not feeling too well. If you've seen the first movie, then you know what's happening (or, more to the point, what's going to happen) so you're basically just waiting for it.\n\nOne thing that I noted was that the events of this movie were taking place at the same time as the events of Quarantine. In fact, one of the airplane passengers is using the airplane's wifi to watch a news broadcast about the quarantined building in Los Angeles. While the disease and its effects are pretty much the same, there's more of an effort made here to get to the background and origins of the disease, which is really dealt with only in a few hints toward the end of Quarantine.\n\nQuarantine (and Rec) are filmed in a "Blair Witch" style - hand held cameras recording the action as it takes place. Quarantine 2 takes a more standard approach to movie-making. I think the hand held camera idea has been done to death, quite frankly, so I didn't miss it. It's clear that the ending of this movie was also intended to set up another potential sequel. That was just a little too obvious. Basically, I'd say this isn't as good as the movies that spawned it, but as a horror movie it's still very effective.

This is doubtless the funnier movie of Nicolas Benamou but he has the merit to put successfully some scenes where we didn't expect to see them and to made the whole audience laugh.\n\nI think my rate is not so high because some actors were not convincing enough and some clichés should have been enhanced further.\n\nN.B. : some scenes are a bit violent (a child less than 10 left during one of them) ... so please avoid him that if yours is likely to have nightmares.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2921,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-12-21","keywords":"family","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305296/","name":"José Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244707/","name":"André Dussollier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2404839/","name":"Caroline Vigneaux"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1318381/","name":"Nicolas Benamou"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086916/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418621/","name":"Frédéric Jardin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736676/","name":"Fabrice Roger-Lacan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1318381/","name":"Nicolas Benamou"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu.

Looking back I can see many of the things that should have been changed, but the movie is a break out. A different type of movie, it is so different than everything else out there. It is original, and out-there.\n\nWhen watching this film you MUST be open-minded. Do not look at any of the negative reviews and watch the movie fresh of mind. If you know everything that is going to happen it makes it less entertaining too.

To his credit though in the few short films he has made so far none of them have bombed. This movie was 10x the action definately, and was actually way funnier than first one. Will Smith was definately more built, much tougher and more in charge, Martin Lawrence stole the show with his silly remarks every 5 seconds but I loved it. \n\nThe car chase scene on the highway was way better than the Matrix Reloaded's car chase scene, it puts that one to shame. But this highway chase scene will definately rank up there with T3's. Some parts in this movie were a bit overdone such as the morgue scene, won't get into it but I'll leave it at that, and the rats...that's it! :)\n\nIf you are looking for a solid type performance from Will Smith to be a good actor don't bother, this movie was all about pure action, and mindless fun, if that's what you want then go see it, if not don't waste your 2 hours and 40 minutes seeing it. Funny thing is, it didn't feel that long.\n\nCan't wait to see this out on DVD in superbit.

To his credit though in the few short films he has made so far none of them have bombed. This movie was 10x the action definately, and was actually way funnier than first one. Will Smith was definately more built, much tougher and more in charge, Martin Lawrence stole the show with his silly remarks every 5 seconds but I loved it. \n\nThe car chase scene on the highway was way better than the Matrix Reloaded's car chase scene, it puts that one to shame. But this highway chase scene will definately rank up there with T3's. Some parts in this movie were a bit overdone such as the morgue scene, won't get into it but I'll leave it at that, and the rats...that's it! :)\n\nIf you are looking for a solid type performance from Will Smith to be a good actor don't bother, this movie was all about pure action, and mindless fun, if that's what you want then go see it, if not don't waste your 2 hours and 40 minutes seeing it. Funny thing is, it didn't feel that long.\n\nCan't wait to see this out on DVD in superbit. A great sequel.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":240483,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-09-10","keywords":"cuba,police,miami florida,sequel,anti hero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bad Boys 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2360869145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjEzY2QyYzItZjBmYS00MzgzLTllYmEtNzZhYjEwNGRlNjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjEzY2QyYzItZjBmYS00MzgzLTllYmEtNzZhYjEwNGRlNjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005517/","name":"Gabrielle Union"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926729/","name":"Marianne Wibberley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926727/","name":"Cormac Wibberley"],"duration":"PT2H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I recommend seeing it, though on my Boo Hoo Meter, it doesn't even rate, for not a single tear spilled from my eyes, it wasn't that kind of film. It actually was quite a bit scarier than I would have imagined, especially when the evil Satan-like character, who not everyone can see or hear is on screen.\n\nI'm delighted to see a plethora of faith-promoting cinema, and I think that's because so many of us believers are grasping onto whatever shreds of hope that still remain in our dark and dreary world, not to mention the financial success marketing to a faithful populace who thirsts and hungers for something worthy, something uplifting, something not vile, vulgar, gratuitous, or profane. For that reason alone, it's worth supporting.\n\nTo be shared a glimpse of what it might have been like to observe Christ from a different perspective than believers currently have has enough merit to provoke further questioning, which may motivate believers and non-believers alike to plunge yet again into the familiar text of the Holy Bible for what IS provided as scripture and sanctioned for distribution to the saints and the world at large, and that is always a good thing.\n\nAdditionally, I can't help myself in observing all the costumes, sets, casting, accents, props, behaviors, and such, because in a movie, it takes just seconds to see what the book may take pages and pages to describe in setting the period with complete authenticity. This movie eventually won me over in creating a period of time that was utterly believable with one exception, English accents from Britain. Uh, who said the Christ child had an English accent, hello? So, give this aspect a pass and enjoy the rest of what's good about this movie, because there is a lot to appreciate, despite that.\n\nThe physical setting of the film is positively perfect. It's just breathtaking as to how I imagine the accuracy of the day was. It's filmed in Italy, which I guessed when the credits rolled at the end before it said exactly where. Most of the credits are of local people who, naturally, have perfectly Italian last names. I didn't see one evidence of modern-day influence or slip-up, which is saying something. Whoever was in charge of that deserves some kind of award for transporting the viewer to 7 A. D. with no ripples! I really REALLY liked the character, Sarah, the old woman, who surprised and blessed the offending soldiers with food and wine and implored them to spare her family, which was just a brilliant strategy. I have no doubt such women existed and still exist to soften hearts of hardened men. Her weather-beaten look and those of other extras lent to the rawness of the time and harshness of the conditions of that day. They were just great. No sunscreen or night cream regimen for them. No pinking of their lips, no lip balm, and no blush on their cheeks.\n\nOther scenes along their path were sad to see, including the process of hoisting criminals up on crosses. The murdering of all the little boys was also depicted with splatters of blood and shadows, which gave me pause as to whether it would be appropriate for sensitive young viewers, it was pretty intense and scary.\n\nThe other scary role mentioned above was the demon I previously mentioned. He was quite deliciously frightening. His whispers to people who couldn't see him are something I believe is possible in our unseen but still real world. It was interesting that Jesus could see him, could hear him, but was unafraid of him in the least. It was also interesting that the demon didn't know who Jesus was, only that he was an "angel" boy and wanted to thwart his good deeds and influence others to do the same.\n\nThe fact that the film portrayed Christ performing miracles but still didn't know who He was or why He could was reminiscent of Harry Potter, who performed magic as a boy long before he knew he was a wizard. In reality, I prefer to think His mother Mary and Joseph, along with His Father in Heaven let Him know who He was, but I was not upset in any way how this portrayal was presented. We simply don't know, and that's the fun of this picture. It attempts to fill in the gaps the scriptures leave.\n\nThe caution would be to be sure to teach children that this is a work of pure fiction, because of the phenomenon uninformed viewers have of just believing things simply because they are shown in a film, another reason I detest the new "Noah", written with a wicked, intentional, history-revisionist's hand. I refuse to support such deplorable ambitions to distort, marginalize, and destroy real history through political agenda-driven films. This movie is not that. It's simply a suggestion of what may have happened. It offered me a little insight as to the reality of how dangerous it was for him, always being hunted. Joseph and Mary's characters were totally believable. Joseph is a stud for who he was and what he had to take on. Think of it, the scandal! I would have liked to see more of Joseph teaching Jesus how to be a carpenter, how they interacted while not being pursued.\n\nAs you can see, there is enough worth supporting about this film. I can't think of a reason to trash a film that attempts to promote faith, unless you're a faith hater. I just don't get that. Intent matters, and while making money is important to the solvency of a project, I don't believe that is the reason behind why this creative team put this out, not in the least. People who make films like these are part of the solution, not part of the problem, and God bless them for that!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-11","keywords":"israel,jesus christ character,1st century,messiah,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2382672665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Jesus Christ at age seven as he and his family depart Egypt to return home to Nazareth."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6026206/","name":"Adam Greaves-Neal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909906/","name":"Vincent Walsh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322537/","name":"Sara Lazzaro"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043365/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232424/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637492/","name":"Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723351/","name":"Anne Rice"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I recommend seeing it, though on my Boo Hoo Meter, it doesn't even rate, for not a single tear spilled from my eyes, it wasn't that kind of film. It actually was quite a bit scarier than I would have imagined, especially when the evil Satan-like character, who not everyone can see or hear is on screen.\n\nI'm delighted to see a plethora of faith-promoting cinema, and I think that's because so many of us believers are grasping onto whatever shreds of hope that still remain in our dark and dreary world, not to mention the financial success marketing to a faithful populace who thirsts and hungers for something worthy, something uplifting, something not vile, vulgar, gratuitous, or profane. For that reason alone, it's worth supporting.\n\nTo be shared a glimpse of what it might have been like to observe Christ from a different perspective than believers currently have has enough merit to provoke further questioning, which may motivate believers and non-believers alike to plunge yet again into the familiar text of the Holy Bible for what IS provided as scripture and sanctioned for distribution to the saints and the world at large, and that is always a good thing.\n\nAdditionally, I can't help myself in observing all the costumes, sets, casting, accents, props, behaviors, and such, because in a movie, it takes just seconds to see what the book may take pages and pages to describe in setting the period with complete authenticity.

I recommend seeing it, though on my Boo Hoo Meter, it doesn't even rate, for not a single tear spilled from my eyes, it wasn't that kind of film. It actually was quite a bit scarier than I would have imagined, especially when the evil Satan-like character, who not everyone can see or hear is on screen.\n\nI'm delighted to see a plethora of faith-promoting cinema, and I think that's because so many of us believers are grasping onto whatever shreds of hope that still remain in our dark and dreary world, not to mention the financial success marketing to a faithful populace who thirsts and hungers for something worthy, something uplifting, something not vile, vulgar, gratuitous, or profane. For that reason alone, it's worth supporting.\n\nTo be shared a glimpse of what it might have been like to observe Christ from a different perspective than believers currently have has enough merit to provoke further questioning, which may motivate believers and non-believers alike to plunge yet again into the familiar text of the Holy Bible for what IS provided as scripture and sanctioned for distribution to the saints and the world at large, and that is always a good thing.\n\nAdditionally, I can't help myself in observing all the costumes, sets, casting, accents, props, behaviors, and such, because in a movie, it takes just seconds to see what the book may take pages and pages to describe in setting the period with complete authenticity. This movie eventually won me over in creating a period of time that was utterly believable with one exception, English accents from Britain. Uh, who said the Christ child had an English accent, hello? So, give this aspect a pass and enjoy the rest of what's good about this movie, because there is a lot to appreciate, despite that.\n\nThe physical setting of the film is positively perfect. It's just breathtaking as to how I imagine the accuracy of the day was. It's filmed in Italy, which I guessed when the credits rolled at the end before it said exactly where. Most of the credits are of local people who, naturally, have perfectly Italian last names. I didn't see one evidence of modern-day influence or slip-up, which is saying something. Whoever was in charge of that deserves some kind of award for transporting the viewer to 7 A. D. with no ripples! I really REALLY liked the character, Sarah, the old woman, who surprised and blessed the offending soldiers with food and wine and implored them to spare her family, which was just a brilliant strategy. I have no doubt such women existed and still exist to soften hearts of hardened men. Her weather-beaten look and those of other extras lent to the rawness of the time and harshness of the conditions of that day. They were just great. No sunscreen or night cream regimen for them. No pinking of their lips, no lip balm, and no blush on their cheeks.\n\nOther scenes along their path were sad to see, including the process of hoisting criminals up on crosses. The murdering of all the little boys was also depicted with splatters of blood and shadows, which gave me pause as to whether it would be appropriate for sensitive young viewers, it was pretty intense and scary.\n\nThe other scary role mentioned above was the demon I previously mentioned. He was quite deliciously frightening. His whispers to people who couldn't see him are something I believe is possible in our unseen but still real world. It was interesting that Jesus could see him, could hear him, but was unafraid of him in the least. It was also interesting that the demon didn't know who Jesus was, only that he was an "angel" boy and wanted to thwart his good deeds and influence others to do the same.\n\nThe fact that the film portrayed Christ performing miracles but still didn't know who He was or why He could was reminiscent of Harry Potter, who performed magic as a boy long before he knew he was a wizard. In reality, I prefer to think His mother Mary and Joseph, along with His Father in Heaven let Him know who He was, but I was not upset in any way how this portrayal was presented. We simply don't know, and that's the fun of this picture. It attempts to fill in the gaps the scriptures leave.\n\nThe caution would be to be sure to teach children that this is a work of pure fiction, because of the phenomenon uninformed viewers have of just believing things simply because they are shown in a film, another reason I detest the new "Noah", written with a wicked, intentional, history-revisionist's hand. I refuse to support such deplorable ambitions to distort, marginalize, and destroy real history through political agenda-driven films. This movie is not that. It's simply a suggestion of what may have happened. It offered me a little insight as to the reality of how dangerous it was for him, always being hunted. Joseph and Mary's characters were totally believable. Joseph is a stud for who he was and what he had to take on. Think of it, the scandal! I would have liked to see more of Joseph teaching Jesus how to be a carpenter, how they interacted while not being pursued.\n\nAs you can see, there is enough worth supporting about this film. I can't think of a reason to trash a film that attempts to promote faith, unless you're a faith hater. I just don't get that. Intent matters, and while making money is important to the solvency of a project, I don't believe that is the reason behind why this creative team put this out, not in the least. People who make films like these are part of the solution, not part of the problem, and God bless them for that!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-11","keywords":"israel,jesus christ character,1st century,messiah,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2382672665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Jesus Christ at age seven as he and his family depart Egypt to return home to Nazareth."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6026206/","name":"Adam Greaves-Neal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909906/","name":"Vincent Walsh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322537/","name":"Sara Lazzaro"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043365/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232424/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637492/","name":"Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723351/","name":"Anne Rice"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No pinking of their lips, no lip balm, and no blush on their cheeks.\n\nOther scenes along their path were sad to see, including the process of hoisting criminals up on crosses. The murdering of all the little boys was also depicted with splatters of blood and shadows, which gave me pause as to whether it would be appropriate for sensitive young viewers, it was pretty intense and scary.\n\nThe other scary role mentioned above was the demon I previously mentioned. He was quite deliciously frightening. His whispers to people who couldn't see him are something I believe is possible in our unseen but still real world. It was interesting that Jesus could see him, could hear him, but was unafraid of him in the least. It was also interesting that the demon didn't know who Jesus was, only that he was an "angel" boy and wanted to thwart his good deeds and influence others to do the same.\n\nThe fact that the film portrayed Christ performing miracles but still didn't know who He was or why He could was reminiscent of Harry Potter, who performed magic as a boy long before he knew he was a wizard. In reality, I prefer to think His mother Mary and Joseph, along with His Father in Heaven let Him know who He was, but I was not upset in any way how this portrayal was presented. We simply don't know, and that's the fun of this picture. It attempts to fill in the gaps the scriptures leave.\n\nThe caution would be to be sure to teach children that this is a work of pure fiction, because of the phenomenon uninformed viewers have of just believing things simply because they are shown in a film, another reason I detest the new "Noah", written with a wicked, intentional, history-revisionist's hand. I refuse to support such deplorable ambitions to distort, marginalize, and destroy real history through political agenda-driven films. This movie is not that. It's simply a suggestion of what may have happened. It offered me a little insight as to the reality of how dangerous it was for him, always being hunted. Joseph and Mary's characters were totally believable. Joseph is a stud for who he was and what he had to take on. Think of it, the scandal! I would have liked to see more of Joseph teaching Jesus how to be a carpenter, how they interacted while not being pursued.\n\nAs you can see, there is enough worth supporting about this film. I can't think of a reason to trash a film that attempts to promote faith, unless you're a faith hater. I just don't get that. Intent matters, and while making money is important to the solvency of a project, I don't believe that is the reason behind why this creative team put this out, not in the least. People who make films like these are part of the solution, not part of the problem, and God bless them for that!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-11","keywords":"israel,jesus christ character,1st century,messiah,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2382672665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Jesus Christ at age seven as he and his family depart Egypt to return home to Nazareth.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6026206/","name":"Adam Greaves-Neal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909906/","name":"Vincent Walsh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322537/","name":"Sara Lazzaro"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043365/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637492/","name":"Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723351/","name":"Anne Rice"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Simply appalling and for so glad I was bored enough to press play before letting my Niece and Nephew watch this. Having absolutely no entertainment value even for adults makes this the absolute in-classifiable animated movie.\n\nThe flow of the story line is bumpy and animation is stiff. Although the animation style could be intentional, it seems artificial and more digestible as a school presentation.

Viewed during 2015 AFI FEST.\n\n"Dheepan," is the latest work by director Jacques Audiard. Audiard has to his credits the critically acclaimed and well nominated films "Rust and Bone"(2012), and "A Prophet"(2009). "Dheepan," is written by Audiard, Thomas Bidegain and Noe Debre', and tells the story of a Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger, called Dheepan. Dheepan is played by Indian actor, Antonythasan Jesuthasan.\n\nWinner of the coveted Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, "Deephan," is a visual feast beginning in the jungles of Sri Lanka and the ensuing shots depicting Dheepan's cultural transformation in the night streets of Paris. Epinine Momenceau provides the cinematography in a compelling manner along with a nicely done soundtrack by Nicolas Jarr.\n\nAs the film opens we see Dheepan and fellow Tamil warriors placing dry palm branches over a funeral pyre. Dheepan place his military fatigues on top and lights the fire. Sri Lanka is mired in a bloody civil war. Dheepan along with an unknown woman called Yalini, played by Kalieaswari Srinivasan, and a young orphan girl, Illayaal, played by Claudine Vinasithamby, decide to flee the strife together and set out for a new life in the suburbs of Paris posing as a displaced refugee family. With the inventiveness of a well versed interpreter, Dheepan and Yalini pass their social services interview and find employment as caretakers of a not so well-to-do housing project and one of it's incoherent inhabitants.To complicate matters, Illayaal is having difficulties at school, Dheepan is contacted by a Tamil warrior who insists Dheepan continue the fight for freedom, and Yalini is becoming attracted to the gang leader nephew of her incoherent charge. This is all on top of the deeper humanistic component of three strangers living together as a family in a small apartment in an entirely foreign culture.\n\nSoon, however, Dheepan and his refugee family begin to pull together as they experience renewed forms of violence. Their challenging suburban life becomes increasingly dangerous due to drug activity and an ensuing turf war that hits too close to home. Dheepan, working primarily as an janitor, takes a stand and declares a no-fire zone between his apartment building and the adjacent housing project much to the disbelief and chagrin of the well-armed gang members. As the turf war breaks out and spills over into the "safe zone," Dheepan shifts gears and his switch is flipped. He becomes an uber-soldier defending and protecting what has become his. This is an extraordinary transformation as he resorts to survival skills presumably developed as a Tamil freedom fighter. The action sequences heightens the drama in its fragmented and rather hazy segments as Dheepan's deep and powerful emotional chords propel him through the violence and chaos until victory is his.\n\nAll in all, I found "Dheepan," to be a very moving film with its riveting action sequences contrasting with its earlier tender, more human sequences. Audiard takes a very timely topic, the displaced refugee, and embodies him and her, with very human characteristics.

It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot, even if some bits of it did lose me.\n\nI've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC mini-series, so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this two-hour film, but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson, because there is a constant tension to the film – cold perhaps, but very tense at times, certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.\n\nThis is not what he does best though, because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness, of an unnecessary function and a pointless "war". This feeling is in the characters, in the set-decoration and in every shot. The men we follow had the height of their import many years ago – now it appears they are mainly fighting their equal numbers on the other side simply because they exist. I really liked this overarching sense of smallness that sat across the film and I enjoyed finding it being employed in even the smallest detail – in the attitude of a minor character through to the cheap "do not unplug" text scrawled on the wall (those that work in older offices will know this feeling). Alfredson is bang on the money with this feeling, it is part of the story and it is brilliantly delivered throughout.\n\nSpeaking of brilliant delivery, the cast is deep in British talent and unsurprisingly they deliver. Oldman may not have won the Oscar but he is great here – working with restraint and doing so much. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. He is the lead here but alongside him is a cast that is hard not to just list – Cumberbach, Hurt, Jones, Firth, Burke, Graham, Hardy and so on; British all perhaps but it says a lot that almost all of the supporting players here will be recognised internationally. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing.\n\nOverall, this is a great film albeit one that is not as easy to follow as those impatient snobs would have you believe. It is OK to struggle with some aspects and it is still easy to enjoy the film. The plot engaged me but what stayed with me more than anything else was how it all seemed so unimportant, how those involved were all working to ignore the irrelevance of their work and how very tired this world seemed – this aspect was very well done and made the film as much as Oldman's strong central performance."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":194843,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"spy,cold war,mole,double agent,woman on top","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Domestic Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3394673689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6's echelons."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019247/","name":"Tomas Alfredson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0350317/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035433/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494170/","name":"John le Carré"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2091799/","name":"Bridget O'Connor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot, even if some bits of it did lose me.\n\nI've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC mini-series, so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this two-hour film, but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson, because there is a constant tension to the film – cold perhaps, but very tense at times, certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.\n\nThis is not what he does best though, because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness, of an unnecessary function and a pointless "war". This feeling is in the characters, in the set-decoration and in every shot. The men we follow had the height of their import many years ago – now it appears they are mainly fighting their equal numbers on the other side simply because they exist. I really liked this overarching sense of smallness that sat across the film and I enjoyed finding it being employed in even the smallest detail – in the attitude of a minor character through to the cheap "do not unplug" text scrawled on the wall (those that work in older offices will know this feeling). Alfredson is bang on the money with this feeling, it is part of the story and it is brilliantly delivered throughout.\n\nSpeaking of brilliant delivery, the cast is deep in British talent and unsurprisingly they deliver. Oldman may not have won the Oscar but he is great here – working with restraint and doing so much. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. He is the lead here but alongside him is a cast that is hard not to just list – Cumberbach, Hurt, Jones, Firth, Burke, Graham, Hardy and so on; British all perhaps but it says a lot that almost all of the supporting players here will be recognised internationally. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing.\n\nOverall, this is a great film albeit one that is not as easy to follow as those impatient snobs would have you believe. It is OK to struggle with some aspects and it is still easy to enjoy the film. The plot engaged me but what stayed with me more than anything else was how it all seemed so unimportant, how those involved were all working to ignore the irrelevance of their work and how very tired this world seemed – this aspect was very well done and made the film as much as Oldman's strong central performance.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":194843,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"spy,cold war,mole,double agent,woman on top","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Domestic Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3394673689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6's echelons.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019247/","name":"Tomas Alfredson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0350317/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035433/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494170/","name":"John le Carré","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2091799/","name":"Bridget O'Connor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Harrington is a little flat at first but once the character grows so does his acting to something more brooding. Gatiss is too cartoonish in places, but at other times he is quite creepy.\n\nHowever, the script does feel underdeveloped and tonally unbalanced, both too bland and too broad. It also too talky, Episode 2 especially is too heavy in talk and rambles, and it does affect the pacing which can be dull. \n\nCharacterisation is also not as rich as it could have been, too many of the characters are too one-dimensional and one doesn't really get to know them.

Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had.

If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson, because there is a constant tension to the film – cold perhaps, but very tense at times, certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.\n\nThis is not what he does best though, because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness, of an unnecessary function and a pointless "war". This feeling is in the characters, in the set-decoration and in every shot. The men we follow had the height of their import many years ago – now it appears they are mainly fighting their equal numbers on the other side simply because they exist. I really liked this overarching sense of smallness that sat across the film and I enjoyed finding it being employed in even the smallest detail – in the attitude of a minor character through to the cheap "do not unplug" text scrawled on the wall (those that work in older offices will know this feeling). Alfredson is bang on the money with this feeling, it is part of the story and it is brilliantly delivered throughout.\n\nSpeaking of brilliant delivery, the cast is deep in British talent and unsurprisingly they deliver. Oldman may not have won the Oscar but he is great here – working with restraint and doing so much. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. He is the lead here but alongside him is a cast that is hard not to just list – Cumberbach, Hurt, Jones, Firth, Burke, Graham, Hardy and so on; British all perhaps but it says a lot that almost all of the supporting players here will be recognised internationally. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing.\n\nOverall, this is a great film albeit one that is not as easy to follow as those impatient snobs would have you believe. It is OK to struggle with some aspects and it is still easy to enjoy the film. The plot engaged me but what stayed with me more than anything else was how it all seemed so unimportant, how those involved were all working to ignore the irrelevance of their work and how very tired this world seemed – this aspect was very well done and made the film as much as Oldman's strong central performance."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":194843,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"spy,cold war,mole,double agent,woman on top","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Domestic Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3394673689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6's echelons."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019247/","name":"Tomas Alfredson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0350317/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035433/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494170/","name":"John le Carré"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2091799/","name":"Bridget O'Connor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.\n\nJulianne Moore is great, as always.

He was quite captivating to watch in 'Color Out of Space' as were the entire cast for that matter.\n\nThis is an extremely visually unique film. The use of colours in the film (a part of the plot - sort of at least) is incredibly beautiful and makes the film very distinct and memorable for that reason alone. Also the film is a lot darker than I expected it to be. Around the halfway point in the film something happens that really took me off-guard and and took the film to another level in terms of brutality.\n\nI feel like Stephen King would like to have his name to a film like this. Back in the day when he still cared about his writing this is the kind of story he would've created. The only downside of the film to me was the ending. It felt a bit flat and uncreative, almost like they couldn't think of a proper and fitting way to conclude it.

Titus Welliver is the perfect Bosch, the rest of the cast are just as brilliant and the writing and production are both spot on. The story line is in fact two Bosch books woven into one and it has been done very cleverly.

I can tell you Lara is thankfully anything but pointless.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1856,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-11-07","keywords":"60th birthday,mother son conflict,piano teacher,suicidal thoughts,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi977779737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771713/","name":"Tom Schilling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3605549/","name":"Mala Emde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090674/","name":"Rainer Bock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1673756/","name":"Jan-Ole Gerster"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051615/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002254/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092424/","name":"Blaz Kutin"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This gives the makers of the film a much larger audience than just Britain. George Peppard and Sophia Loren have significant roles, but are not the stars of the movie. Details like portraying Hanna Reitsch and having accurate, and very good special effects make this far better than most World War II movies. Especially since most of the stars of the movie don't survive.

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's more of a team player effort. Of course, Both main characters, Lieberman and the inspector, have to come together from very diametrical positions of how a case should be solved. The term of 'profiler' is used, and I'm quite sure that's for the audience only, and wasn't known then. But they may have had a similiar name for a killer's extrapolated personality. Acting is really very good, and Mathew Beard is just optimal for Liebermann, exploring new methods of deduction and investigation. Very high production values, meticulously catching the flair of the young 20th century during the short time when Vienna was the capital of a huge empire, where the Jews tried to find their place by assimilating themselves. There is always some dry humor present, which makes the show a very pleasant watch. Directing by Robert Dornhelm in the first episode is great. Tension is built very well until the case is solved in a nice finale. Of course Vienna is the third main Character, as it is shown in most of it's remaining Glory from the old days. There are some small references to the famous 'Third Man', or I thought to recognise them. In this first episode most of the secondary characters did not get much attention, but I hope this will change in later episodes. I hope the coming episodes are equally high in quality to the first one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-18","keywords":"fin de siecle,austria,vienna austria,police detective,vienna police department","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0063914/","name":"Matthew Beard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561029/","name":"Jürgen Maurer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1800670/","name":"Charlene McKenna"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104998/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115148/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078814/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1839162/","name":"Steve Thompson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer - Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1751432729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxMWI2ZDUtYzdkNi00NDc3LWExNDEtNmFkNjVlOTA1NDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxMWI2ZDUtYzdkNi00NDc3LWExNDEtNmFkNjVlOTA1NDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Max Liebermann, a student of Sigmund Freud, helps Detective Rheinhardt in the investigation of a series of disturbing murders around the grand cafes and opera houses of 1900s Vienna."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer.

In fact, I truly believe that it is a small jewel and aspiring cult movie. The setting is surprisingly good, the script, based on a book by Guy Lyon Playfair (one of the Enfield investigators), is magnificent. It does not abuse of any special effects, and it does back to the typical horror- suspense movies of the 70's and 80's like "The Changeling" type. Now that all horror films are gore or a collection of special effects, that is thankful. In addition, the script is full of subtle comic moments, surreal even, perfectly matched with the suspense of the film, that far from falling into the "Scary Movie" manners, what it does is humanize the characters, make them closer to the viewer and endow them with a certain psychological depth; help to this the great performances (along with the great script), of practically all the actors and actresses of this, in my opinion, small great work of art. The girl who plays Janet (Eleanor Worthington Cox) and the actor who plays Grosse (Timothy Spall) are immeasurable, great. The background of the work transcends the simple entertainment cinema (which is, but with quality), and penetrates into areas such as the importance of attachment in relationships, love, youth and adolescence, the importance of family, etc ... Simply great, hopefully this type of cinema more personal (even if it is in the fantastic-terror terrain) popularizes and more works are done as well as this. It is not necessary to spend a million- euro in special effects in a movie so that it can turn out (this film is proof of it), in fact this film gains credibility by using the just and the just, sometimes very handmade. A film conceived for TV, very good and highly recommended!.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4488,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2015-05-03","keywords":"tv mini series,1970s,psychotronic series,based on true story","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001758/","name":"Timothy Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5732956/","name":"Eleanor Worthington-Cox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0828980/","name":"Juliet Stevenson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197929/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Enfield Haunting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi703642905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmZTdlZTQtZGEzOC00OTdiLTkxZGItYmQxMTA1OTliZjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmZTdlZTQtZGEzOC00OTdiLTkxZGItYmQxMTA1OTliZjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Enfield Haunting"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The series is very reminiscent of Agatha Christie's "Marple" (with Geraldine McEwan ) and "Poirot" (with David Suchet). There's just something special about period murder mysteries, perhaps it's the lack of high tech machines that do our sleuthing for us, a la CSI, or maybe it's the romanticism of the period itself. Regardless, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries is expertly produced from exquisite wardrobe &amp; makeup, to lush shooting locations and breathtaking cinematography. Every element of the production is done with such attention to detail, you loose yourself in the story. The two leads, Essie Davis as Miss Phryne Fisher and Nathan Page as Detective Jack Robinson are perfect in their roles. Having watched each episode thus far, I cannot imagine anyone else portraying these delightful characters and their chemistry is undeniable. The entire cast is great, the characters are well thought out and multi-dimensional. The episodes are also well done, peppered with historical information and accuracy. I would highly recommend "Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries" to any mystery buff, it's a modern classic done in the period style of the roaring 20's.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,australia,female protagonist,headstrong woman,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The word, "noble" means something and not all noblemen demonstrate it. The relationships are not predictable, nor the storyline which shows the desperation of those who scrape by--mostly with honor--and some not troubled by honor but wealth. From our first introduction to Ross, he shows his character and it is impossible not to care about him the way he cares about those in his life. I rate it higher than even Downton Abbey, which I have followed with dedication, as I will with Poldark.

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14820,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,australia,female protagonist,headstrong woman,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12047,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

From our first introduction to Ross, he shows his character and it is impossible not to care about him the way he cares about those in his life.

It's more of a team player effort. Of course, Both main characters, Lieberman and the inspector, have to come together from very diametrical positions of how a case should be solved. The term of 'profiler' is used, and I'm quite sure that's for the audience only, and wasn't known then. But they may have had a similiar name for a killer's extrapolated personality. Acting is really very good, and Mathew Beard is just optimal for Liebermann, exploring new methods of deduction and investigation. Very high production values, meticulously catching the flair of the young 20th century during the short time when Vienna was the capital of a huge empire, where the Jews tried to find their place by assimilating themselves. There is always some dry humor present, which makes the show a very pleasant watch. Directing by Robert Dornhelm in the first episode is great. Tension is built very well until the case is solved in a nice finale. Of course Vienna is the third main Character, as it is shown in most of it's remaining Glory from the old days. There are some small references to the famous 'Third Man', or I thought to recognise them. In this first episode most of the secondary characters did not get much attention, but I hope this will change in later episodes. I hope the coming episodes are equally high in quality to the first one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-18","keywords":"fin de siecle,austria,vienna austria,police detective,vienna police department","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0063914/","name":"Matthew Beard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561029/","name":"Jürgen Maurer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1800670/","name":"Charlene McKenna"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104998/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115148/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078814/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1839162/","name":"Steve Thompson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer - Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1751432729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxMWI2ZDUtYzdkNi00NDc3LWExNDEtNmFkNjVlOTA1NDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxMWI2ZDUtYzdkNi00NDc3LWExNDEtNmFkNjVlOTA1NDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Max Liebermann, a student of Sigmund Freud, helps Detective Rheinhardt in the investigation of a series of disturbing murders around the grand cafes and opera houses of 1900s Vienna."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Started out a bit boring, then a few sub plots were introduced that seemed pointless at first. But wow!! By the last 2-3 episodes I couldn't stop watching. The character development is very slow, and we are shown the worst of everyone first, it seems. As the show progresses, we see almost everyone has some redeeming humanity (and secrets, always secrets). The backdrop of all this is the cinematic paradise of the American Southwest circa 1940, and a war story that we all know how it ends. I feel like I was invited on a blind date, only to find by the end that I have made all kinds of new friends. I hope to hear WGN is going ahead with season 2.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8237,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Furthermore, often people give bad marks just because they don't like an actor or director, which is unfortunate. This show is flat out one of the best I have ever seen. I don't ever recall a series with more action... ever! Chris Vance is flat-out an incredible actor. The whole cast is great. The writing is excellent. Luc Besson has created a real winner here. WATCH THIS SHOW&gt;&gt;&gt; You will not be disappointed! Thanks to everyone who created this gem.

Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

 --- Description: The Closer: Created by James Duff. With Kyra Sedgwick, J.K. Simmons, Corey Reynolds, Robert Gossett.

Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16917,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were.

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16917,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As long as the action sequences are well made that is. "xXx: State of the Union" is a fair try in the genre but ultimately falls short.\n\nThe plot is as ridiculous as in the first movie. The NSA-agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) is once again looking in weird places trying to find a new agent that can break the rules and succeed. This time he finds Darius Stone (Ice Cube) in a military prison. Stone is an ex Navy Seal who will help Gibbons fight off a rogue part of the US Military trying to dispose of the president.\n\nSeriously, no one watches these movies for the plot anyway. So that the plot is ridiculous and cheesy is beside the point. No one watches this for the acting either. So that Ice Cube is not as much an actor as a walking scowl is ALSO beside the point. He does about as good a job as Vin Diesel did anyway. What is NOT beside the point though is the fact that "xXx: State of the Union" employs the same method of action filming as many other Hollywood-movies of late. You know the method: "move the camera exceptionally close and shake it like if the camera-man was a spastic". I know that this is to hide the fact that Ice Cube doesn't know how to fight. Still it's incredibly irritating! Also the lack of logic is too evident at times. Like Ice Cube driving a sports car 360km/h on a train track with his tires torn off... Seriously.\n\nOtherwise this had some potential. The technical quality is great, the movie looks really expensive. It has a lot of fun gadgets and crappy one-liners. And the speed of this movie is absolutely insane. Right from the beginning Lee Tamahori steps on it without ever looking back. So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring, there is always something happening on screen. But the flaws in mostly the action department as well as the complete lack of logic disturbs the experience. It's still a lot better than the first movie though. I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.\n\nSo in the end i think this "James Bond on steroids" will probably attract a lot of 15-yearolds that like when things keep moving and lights keep flashing. People who like to see a plot and at least some traces of logic might want to stay away though. It could have been the brainless action movie of the year, but it desperately needs some better action-directing for that.

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims.

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV.

Well, George Clooney definitely took that to heart when he decided to direct and act in Leatherheads. This movie hits back to "It Happened One Night" type of slap stick, or at least that's what it reminded me of. To me it seems like George Clooney is trying to be like the next Clark Gable, Renee Zellwegger, don't get me wrong, I love this girl, she's a great actress, but I wasn't too impressed with her performance in Leatherheads. With her and George it seemed like they were trying so hard to make the slap stick work and really forced it, while the jokes are funny, it doesn't click as well as it should like the old time comedies. The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know wither it wants to be a romantic comedy slap stick or how football was born in America type of comedy, so George Clooney misses more than hits.\n\nSet in the 1920's, Jimmy and his football team are in the birth of football. The problem is that they don't win and their sponsors are fed up with their stunts and loosing streaks. So when they drop the football team, Jimmy looks for a job, but fails, but later he comes across college football star, Carter Rutherford. He offers Rutherford to join the team and the sponsors get back into play. Rutherford is also known war hero and reporter, Lexie Littleton is on the case to find out "the truth" that could possible damage Carter's career. But Jimmy is also attracted Lexie and may have to give up the only way to boost the football team's reputation again for Lexie's story.\n\nWould I recommend Leatherheads? I would say that it's worth a matinée, it's a cute movie and has some fun laughs. I loved the scene with Jimmy and Carter who just punch each other in the face and beg not to hit anywhere else because it's their weak spot. Just I think the editing was a little off, some scenes I don't understand why they were not cut in half or were even needed. George Clooney wasn't looking to make a masterpiece, but I think he took this film in the wrong direction and it's not that impressive. It's a decent movie, worth the watch, but it's not something I would buy.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-05-14","keywords":"football,1920s,story continued during end credits,neo screwball comedy,goofball","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Leatherheads","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi632422681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NTY4ODU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NTY4ODU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Leatherheads Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1024677/","name":"John Krasinski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058884/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0184096/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1445106/","name":"Duncan Brantley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0717733/","name":"Rick Reilly"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova serija u 12 epizoda približit će priče o Brennan, Boothu i Jeffersonian-FBI ekipi, omogućujući vjernim fanovima emisije da se oproste od ovih nezaboravnih likova. Glavni likovi ove mračno zabavne proceduralne drame su usko specijalizirana forenzična antropologinja dr. Brennan i agent FBI-a Seeley Booth. Oni surađuju u istragama ubojstava u kojima su standardne metode identifikacije tijela beskorisne.</desc>

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277469,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's just good fun!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122108,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-10-03","keywords":"conflict of interest,female protagonist,friend,neighborhood,suicide","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000159/","name":"Teri Hatcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005031/","name":"Felicity Huffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189220/","name":"Marcia Cross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028589/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156100/","name":"Marc Cherry"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1644955417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"TT #1"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In some ways, it is. Men are still represented the same way -- to be blunt, idiots -- and it's still very targeted towards females.\n\nHowever what I found is that "Desperate Housewives" contains a very funny satirical, dark edge to its humor that elevates it above "Sex and the City" and some other such shows that were previously on television... as a result it can be enjoyed by men and women -- if you like dark suburban comedies such as "The War of the Roses" and "The 'burbs" you'll probably love this.\n\nIt centers around a neighborhood of housewives who are trying to figure out who may or may not have killed one of their friends, a woman who supposedly committed suicide.\n\nMeanwhile the show focuses on their relationships, trials and tribulations, mainly the character of Teri Hatcher, who is the one we are meant to feel the most sympathy for.\n\nAlthough "Desperate Housewives" is rather silly at times and perhaps a bit too smug and clever for its own good, I find it very easy to watch and one of the better entertainments available on television at the time. I'd recommend it to anyone who can appreciate absurd dark humor set in a realistic environment.

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277469,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His unflinching, brutally honest portrayals of flawed people make him popular with the indie crowd, but it's difficult to recommend his movies to anyone else. It's difficult not to identify with the parade of eternal losers of Solondz's movies, no matter how flawed they are, because, really, these people are us. We might try to deny it, of course, but the truth of the matter is that his movies are just too uncomfortably real for many people to enjoy. You might not be an awkward, depressed girl or an obnoxious, entitled man-child, but there's probably some aspect that you can relate to. If not, then you probably know someone like this. Solondz knows who we are, and he knows our society.\n\nDark Horse continues a rather surreal and artistic direction for Solondz. Fantasy, dreams, and reality all freely intermix. It might leave some audiences a bit confused, but it's usually pretty obvious which are which. In fact, I really enjoyed some of these scenes, because they opened the door to really inventive narrative and metaphor. In some ways, it was like David Lynch, but without the free-form stream-of-consciousness. These scenes really illustrate the characters better than any traditional scene could. The hilariously banal conversations are another nice touch. Anyone who appreciates irony will certainly enjoy them, though the irony-impaired, I think, will possibly hate this movie.\n\nSolondz's characters have arguably never before been so depressed, bitter, and broken. If you're looking for an uplifting story, full of inspirational and likable characters, this is not the movie for you. Solondz is the undisputed master of strangely sympathetic portraits of society's biggest losers and weirdos. This one will hit pretty close to home for many geeks.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"hepatitis b,man wrapped in a towel,collectible,theater poster,poster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi516268569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance blooms between two thirty-somethings in arrested development: an avid toy collector who lives with his parents and a woman who is the dark horse of her family.

My thought is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. I personally enjoy it, along with the Chicago franchise (Fire&amp;PD). The crossover events are especially fun to watch. Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it. And I don't mean to offend but to say it's like a soap opera is kinda funny to me because what is Grey's if not a soap? Most medical dramas have an element of such as well as miraculous cures at the end of the hour.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-11-17","keywords":"shared universe,doctor,emergency room,hospital,medical profession","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3674742/","name":"Nick Gehlfuss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012679/","name":"Marlyne Barrett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001624/","name":"Oliver Platt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104973/","name":"Michael Brandt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351929/","name":"Derek Haas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631709/","name":"Matt Olmstead"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chicago Med: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2863249433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM1MmY5ZDYtNzM0Mi00OWU5LWIxYjYtODA1ZTlhY2FlMzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM1MmY5ZDYtNzM0Mi00OWU5LWIxYjYtODA1ZTlhY2FlMzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Series Premiere Trailer"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

My thought is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. I personally enjoy it, along with the Chicago franchise (Fire&amp;PD). The crossover events are especially fun to watch. Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it. And I don't mean to offend but to say it's like a soap opera is kinda funny to me because what is Grey's if not a soap? Most medical dramas have an element of such as well as miraculous cures at the end of the hour.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-11-17","keywords":"shared universe,doctor,emergency room,hospital,medical profession","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3674742/","name":"Nick Gehlfuss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012679/","name":"Marlyne Barrett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001624/","name":"Oliver Platt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104973/","name":"Michael Brandt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351929/","name":"Derek Haas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631709/","name":"Matt Olmstead"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chicago Med: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2863249433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM1MmY5ZDYtNzM0Mi00OWU5LWIxYjYtODA1ZTlhY2FlMzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM1MmY5ZDYtNzM0Mi00OWU5LWIxYjYtODA1ZTlhY2FlMzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Series Premiere Trailer"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His unflinching, brutally honest portrayals of flawed people make him popular with the indie crowd, but it's difficult to recommend his movies to anyone else. It's difficult not to identify with the parade of eternal losers of Solondz's movies, no matter how flawed they are, because, really, these people are us. We might try to deny it, of course, but the truth of the matter is that his movies are just too uncomfortably real for many people to enjoy. You might not be an awkward, depressed girl or an obnoxious, entitled man-child, but there's probably some aspect that you can relate to. If not, then you probably know someone like this. Solondz knows who we are, and he knows our society.\n\nDark Horse continues a rather surreal and artistic direction for Solondz. Fantasy, dreams, and reality all freely intermix. It might leave some audiences a bit confused, but it's usually pretty obvious which are which. In fact, I really enjoyed some of these scenes, because they opened the door to really inventive narrative and metaphor. In some ways, it was like David Lynch, but without the free-form stream-of-consciousness. These scenes really illustrate the characters better than any traditional scene could. The hilariously banal conversations are another nice touch. Anyone who appreciates irony will certainly enjoy them, though the irony-impaired, I think, will possibly hate this movie.\n\nSolondz's characters have arguably never before been so depressed, bitter, and broken. If you're looking for an uplifting story, full of inspirational and likable characters, this is not the movie for you. Solondz is the undisputed master of strangely sympathetic portraits of society's biggest losers and weirdos. This one will hit pretty close to home for many geeks.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"hepatitis b,man wrapped in a towel,collectible,theater poster,poster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi516268569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance blooms between two thirty-somethings in arrested development: an avid toy collector who lives with his parents and a woman who is the dark horse of her family.

It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":277469,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His unflinching, brutally honest portrayals of flawed people make him popular with the indie crowd, but it's difficult to recommend his movies to anyone else. It's difficult not to identify with the parade of eternal losers of Solondz's movies, no matter how flawed they are, because, really, these people are us. We might try to deny it, of course, but the truth of the matter is that his movies are just too uncomfortably real for many people to enjoy. You might not be an awkward, depressed girl or an obnoxious, entitled man-child, but there's probably some aspect that you can relate to. If not, then you probably know someone like this. Solondz knows who we are, and he knows our society.\n\nDark Horse continues a rather surreal and artistic direction for Solondz. Fantasy, dreams, and reality all freely intermix. It might leave some audiences a bit confused, but it's usually pretty obvious which are which. In fact, I really enjoyed some of these scenes, because they opened the door to really inventive narrative and metaphor. In some ways, it was like David Lynch, but without the free-form stream-of-consciousness. These scenes really illustrate the characters better than any traditional scene could. The hilariously banal conversations are another nice touch. Anyone who appreciates irony will certainly enjoy them, though the irony-impaired, I think, will possibly hate this movie.\n\nSolondz's characters have arguably never before been so depressed, bitter, and broken. If you're looking for an uplifting story, full of inspirational and likable characters, this is not the movie for you. Solondz is the undisputed master of strangely sympathetic portraits of society's biggest losers and weirdos.

The plot of the show involves a circle of four female friends who become engrossed in a missing persons case when the "queen bee" of their group, Allison, goes missing and the remaining friends find themselves being blackmailed by "A" who seems to know an awful lot of their secrets.\n\nUnlike the other ABC Family teen dramas (i.e. - Secret Life of the American Teenager) I found that Pretty Little Liars has much better character development and the actors who portray them are all very believable and talented. Each character has their own interesting subplot which is what really drives the show.

Kevin Costner takes the title role and proves to be handsome enough and swashbuckling enough to do justice to the role during the action scenes. However, during the film's quieter moments, Costner's American accent grates a little amid the Sherwood Forest surroundings.\n\n The story doesn't particularly need explaining, but for people who have lived on Mars for their whole lives here it is. Robin of Locksley, a young soldier, returns from the Crusades to find the city of Nottingham and its surrounding area terrorised by the evil Sherrif of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Robin takes refuge in the nearby Sherwood Forest, where he gathers a band of woodland outlaws who are always stealing money and treasure taken by the Sherrif and giving it back to the poor. His dashing antics impress Maid Marian (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio), a childhood friend, and he quickly becomes popular with the poor and honest folk who nickname him Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves.\n\n The film is very old-fashioned, but it occasionally gives away its 1991 release status with modern touches (the fancy camera-work in which the camera is seemingly fixed upon an arrow as it is fired at a target; the introduction of a Moorish warrior character [Morgan Freeman] to broaden the film's cultural reference; Rickman's self-deprecating pantomimic turn as the wicked Sherrif). On the whole, it is an entertaining film with a good balance between the action and the romance. The best performance - surprisingly - comes from Michael Wincott who oozes menace as the Sherrif's despicable cousin Guy of Gisbourne. There are some quite significant factual errors, the best (by "best" I mean "funniest") of which is when Robin and his Moorish companion stand at the foot of the white cliffs of Dover and Robin tells him: "by nightfall we will dine with my father!" Quite a feat, since Nottinghamshire is about 200 miles away and this pair are travelling on foot!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1991-06-14","keywords":"robin hood character,jerusalem israel,england,modern minstrel,balladeer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2054227737","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyMjE2OTQtOGY1Ny00MGMwLTkyNzgtZjU0NTE0NmY2NGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyMjE2OTQtOGY1Ny00MGMwLTkyNzgtZjU0NTE0NmY2NGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000126/","name":"Kevin Costner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001512/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0721817/","name":"Kevin Reynolds"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0219720/","name":"Pen Densham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914709/","name":"John Watson"}],"duration":"PT2H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Kevin Costner takes the title role and proves to be handsome enough and swashbuckling enough to do justice to the role during the action scenes. However, during the film's quieter moments, Costner's American accent grates a little amid the Sherwood Forest surroundings.\n\n The story doesn't particularly need explaining, but for people who have lived on Mars for their whole lives here it is. Robin of Locksley, a young soldier, returns from the Crusades to find the city of Nottingham and its surrounding area terrorised by the evil Sherrif of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Robin takes refuge in the nearby Sherwood Forest, where he gathers a band of woodland outlaws who are always stealing money and treasure taken by the Sherrif and giving it back to the poor. His dashing antics impress Maid Marian (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio), a childhood friend, and he quickly becomes popular with the poor and honest folk who nickname him Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves.\n\n The film is very old-fashioned, but it occasionally gives away its 1991 release status with modern touches (the fancy camera-work in which the camera is seemingly fixed upon an arrow as it is fired at a target; the introduction of a Moorish warrior character [Morgan Freeman] to broaden the film's cultural reference; Rickman's self-deprecating pantomimic turn as the wicked Sherrif). On the whole, it is an entertaining film with a good balance between the action and the romance. The best performance - surprisingly - comes from Michael Wincott who oozes menace as the Sherrif's despicable cousin Guy of Gisbourne. There are some quite significant factual errors, the best (by "best" I mean "funniest") of which is when Robin and his Moorish companion stand at the foot of the white cliffs of Dover and Robin tells him: "by nightfall we will dine with my father!" Quite a feat, since Nottinghamshire is about 200 miles away and this pair are travelling on foot!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1991-06-14","keywords":"robin hood character,jerusalem israel,england,modern minstrel,balladeer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2054227737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyMjE2OTQtOGY1Ny00MGMwLTkyNzgtZjU0NTE0NmY2NGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyMjE2OTQtOGY1Ny00MGMwLTkyNzgtZjU0NTE0NmY2NGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000126/","name":"Kevin Costner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001512/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0721817/","name":"Kevin Reynolds"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0219720/","name":"Pen Densham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914709/","name":"John Watson"],"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.\n\nThe latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the cliché) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined.\n\nThe texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways.\n\nOn the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching.\n\nJoining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means.\n\nAlong with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nRead all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":697462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2010-03-31","keywords":"dragon,viking,village,father son relationship,island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How to Train Your Dragon: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158218777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiZDUxZTMtMzUxMi00NzYxLTg0NzEtNzViYTY4N2Y2MWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiZDUxZTMtMzUxMi00NzYxLTg0NzEtNzViYTY4N2Y2MWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Young Viking Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third (voice of Jay Baruchel) is sent to the Isle of Berk in the North Sea, where he is to subdue a dragon as a rite of passage."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2395586/","name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213450/","name":"Dean DeBlois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0266260/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213450/","name":"Dean DeBlois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie has as much charm as it has bite, thanks to a fantastic script and Murray's excellent performance. Never dull or cheesy, this wonderful fantasy tale just hits all the right notes, and if anyone knows a better rom-com, please name it. I mean: what other romantic comedies are there where the protagonist commits suicide and you just have to laugh?\n\nI've watched 'Groundhog Day' countless times and, without a doubt, I will watch it again and again (or for as long as I keep waking up to that nerve-wrecking song by Sonny &amp; Cher).

It is simply a star-studded action thriller designed to allow the audience to escape into the world of Chicago hostage squad cops. A wrongfully accused negotiator/cop, played at about 300+ degrees Fahrenheit by Samuel Jackson matches wits with another negotiator, Kevin Spacey, who does his best to keep Jackson from reaching the boiling point. Briefly, Jackson is caught in the middle of an extortion scandal involving the lifting of millions of dollars from the policeman's pension fund. When Jackson's partner becomes aware of the secret heist, he is taken out, and the powers behind the white-collar corporate dealings use Jackson as the scapegoat. Jackson then retaliates by using extra-legal means.\n\nWhat makes this movie are the performances by both Jackson and Spacey, with good performances by the supporting cast, including the late J.T. Walsch who made a career of playing heartless and emotionless middle-age men. And John Spencer is also involved as the Chief of Police, shortly before he was promoted to the White House Chief of Staff in "The West Wing".\n\nThe movie goes a mile a minute but is suffused with an interesting enough storyline to make it well worth the price of admission. Some of what happens is ludicrous when you really think about it, but you tend to just run with it.

It is simply a star-studded action thriller designed to allow the audience to escape into the world of Chicago hostage squad cops. A wrongfully accused negotiator/cop, played at about 300+ degrees Fahrenheit by Samuel Jackson matches wits with another negotiator, Kevin Spacey, who does his best to keep Jackson from reaching the boiling point. Briefly, Jackson is caught in the middle of an extortion scandal involving the lifting of millions of dollars from the policeman's pension fund. When Jackson's partner becomes aware of the secret heist, he is taken out, and the powers behind the white-collar corporate dealings use Jackson as the scapegoat. Jackson then retaliates by using extra-legal means.\n\nWhat makes this movie are the performances by both Jackson and Spacey, with good performances by the supporting cast, including the late J.T. Walsch who made a career of playing heartless and emotionless middle-age men. And John Spencer is also involved as the Chief of Police, shortly before he was promoted to the White House Chief of Staff in "The West Wing".\n\nThe movie goes a mile a minute but is suffused with an interesting enough storyline to make it well worth the price of admission. Some of what happens is ludicrous when you really think about it, but you tend to just run with it. Not a bad way to kill two hours, and you could do a lot worse.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":136419,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-04-28","keywords":"police conspiracy,opening action scene,police shootout,last film role for actor,fbi federal bureau of investigation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Negotiator","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1157038361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTNjMjI1YWEtNjU4YS00N2E0LTlhMzEtOWZiYzFlNzc5ODIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTNjMjI1YWEtNjU4YS00N2E0LTlhMzEtOWZiYzFlNzc5ODIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

After seeing the movie, PLEASE do yourself a favor and read the book.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2004-10-08","keywords":"usa,united states,texas,football,coach","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Peter Berg","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3762141977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWMxNDkzMDItNDVhMS00ZWI3LWI2ZjctNjAyOTkxZjExOGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWMxNDkzMDItNDVhMS00ZWI3LWI2ZjctNjAyOTkxZjExOGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"Ready for action?

Browbeaten, verbally abused, and harassed by everyone in his life, he takes the advice of his close friend (David Cross) to take a self-esteem class taught by a man named "Dr. P" (Billy Bob Thornton), who is quickly found to be the kind of self-esteem teacher to teach you the ways of confidence and self-worth by providing you with even more verbal abuse in your life. Roger's ultimate goal - besides earning respect from others - is to win the heart of his neighbor, an Australian graduate student named Amanda (Jacinda Barrett), who he can't seem to talk to without being met with a panic attack or fainting.\n\nTodd Phillips' School for Scoundrels is a remake of the 1960 film of the same name, which I can only imagine to be a bit nicer and less bossy in its tone and approach to its material. However, despite its over-arching mean-spiritedness as one of its themes, School for Scoundrels actually manages to be a consistently funny comedy, mostly thanks to its capable band of actors, all of whom have had some work in the comedy field and know just what to say and how to say it when the time is right.\n\nFor starters, consider Billy Bob Thornton, who is simply fearless as Dr. P here. Thornton has a way of assimilating well to any given role, be it a foul-mouthed mall-Santa, a questionable folk from the backwoods, or a browbeating self-esteem teacher. Thornton works well here because he's as brash and as off-color as the material, often assisted by his character's assistant "Lesher," played by Michael Clarke Duncan. Now consider Jon Heder who, before this, only got to show his skills in one of the most lackluster comedies of the last decade. Heder is a solid, sympathetic character here, especially for those who can see his characters' struggles and hunger for acceptance and are willing to buy into it. Some characters in films are the reason for their own problems (take virtually any Adam Sandler film from the nineties), but Heder's Roger is simply a bit geeky and a tad uncoordinated, and for that, is unfortunately the target for abuse and ridicule. On those notes alone, his character is easy to side with because he is relatively blameless.\n\nAlongside Heder are the likes of Sarah Silverman as Amanda's friend who continues to give Roger a hard time, Horatio Sanz, Aziz Ansari, David Cross, Dan Fogler, Luis Guzmán, Jim Parsons, and Ben Stiller (however, in a role of questionable value), all of whom very competent comedians who accentuate the quick-witted qualities that got them to that level in the first place. While School for Scoundrels gets by almost entirely on the charisma of its actors, Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong's writing shouldn't go unnoticed. For the most part, the writing duo create an unabashedly fun, silly comedy with enough consistent laughs to warrant a recommendation.\n\nThe only struggle for the film is how it wants to achieve its climax, in this case, making the entire "get the girl" subplot too silly and way too overblown. The film was grounded in a certain, goofy reality up until maybe the eighty-minute mark, and for that reason, the film becomes a bit of a struggle to continue to buy into during its last twenty-five minutes. Regardless, it can't derail the comedic talent at hand, along with Jon Heder's Roger, who, for once, isn't picked on because of his own stupidity but for his own genial manner and geeky appearance. He's a character I can see many identifying with.\n\nThree years after the release of School for Scoundrels (which bombed at the box office and has now, eight years later, faded into almost complete obscurity), Todd Phillips hit a comedy homerun, financially, after directing all three Hangover films, effectively transcending his career into heavily-raunchy material and leaving geniality behind with School for Scoundrels. This is kind of an upsetting fact because this film has the unsung ability to identify when the two sequels leaching off the original Hangover were nothing but an annoyance to moviegoers. The film at hand rarely achieves comedic heights, but its dramatic ones are worth noting and appear to have been grossly shortchanged.\n\nStarring: Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Heder, Jacinda Barrett, Sarah Silverman, Horatio Sanz, David Cross, Dan Fogler, Luis Guzmán, Ben Stiller, Jim Parsons, and Aziz Ansari.

This film, along with the excellent Goodfellas, Awakenings, Night and the City, A Bronx Tale, and Cape Fear highlighted a great actor's resume. He hasn't done many great films in a while, but his acting chops speak for themselves. He stars here as David Merrill, a blacklisted director in Hollyweird, who's basically accused of being a communist and certain government factions want him to name names. His performance, although subdued, is very solid as he struggles with the decision to either report his friends, who are thought to be Communist in order to rescue his once promising career, or refuse to give up any names so their lives and careers won't be destroyed also. There's a moving scene between Merrill and congress as they bombard him with questions and accusations. This is probably the most memorable scene, but I thought it tries to wrap the film up in a neat little ball, as opposed to letting us know exactly what went on in those supposedly communist meetings Merrill was a part of, and what was discussed there and who attended these meetings.\n\nGeorge Wendt does a commendable job as Bunny Baxter, even though it's difficult to see him other than Norm from Cheers, but I digress. Annette Benning and Patricia Wettig also give solid performances in this forgotten little film based on a true story."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8318,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1991-03-15","keywords":"hollywood blacklist,reference to darryl f zanuck,reference to darryl f. zanuck,year 1951,prologue","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000906/","name":"Annette Bening"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001841/","name":"George Wendt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film, along with the excellent Goodfellas, Awakenings, Night and the City, A Bronx Tale, and Cape Fear highlighted a great actor's resume. He hasn't done many great films in a while, but his acting chops speak for themselves. He stars here as David Merrill, a blacklisted director in Hollyweird, who's basically accused of being a communist and certain government factions want him to name names. His performance, although subdued, is very solid as he struggles with the decision to either report his friends, who are thought to be Communist in order to rescue his once promising career, or refuse to give up any names so their lives and careers won't be destroyed also. There's a moving scene between Merrill and congress as they bombard him with questions and accusations. This is probably the most memorable scene, but I thought it tries to wrap the film up in a neat little ball, as opposed to letting us know exactly what went on in those supposedly communist meetings Merrill was a part of, and what was discussed there and who attended these meetings.\n\nGeorge Wendt does a commendable job as Bunny Baxter, even though it's difficult to see him other than Norm from Cheers, but I digress. Annette Benning and Patricia Wettig also give solid performances in this forgotten little film based on a true story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8318,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1991-03-15","keywords":"hollywood blacklist,reference to darryl f zanuck,reference to darryl f. zanuck,year 1951,prologue","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000906/","name":"Annette Bening","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001841/","name":"George Wendt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. \n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch.

But I do usually see them because the originals are good. Checking this out in theaters for me didn't require any trailers, because its based on the Harry Potter universe. What's not to like about that?\n\nThis film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.\n\nFor the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.\n\nThe visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the "fantastic" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.\n\nAfter the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects.

As a big Dinklage's fan, and considering that it was a world premiere, it was easy enough to go check it out. I'm glad I did. This movie is one about the brain and its struggles, but it does so with a big heart. It's funny and touching with a good balance, and the acting is top notch (I'm actually a bigger Dinklage's fan after the movie). The underlying themes about psychiatry as science and its potential negative effect on personality, the nature of identity, the complex interaction of desire and fear are inhabiting the film and are as relevant today as they were at the time. In summary, a great entertaining movie with a deeper layer... and a stellar Dinklage!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1910,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-01-03","keywords":"patient,sex scene,based on true story","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Three Christs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4280205081","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0YjRmZGItOTgwZi00NzM1LWEwOWItMTcwYzUxMTM5YzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0YjRmZGItOTgwZi00NzM1LWEwOWItMTcwYzUxMTM5YzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227759/","name":"Peter Dinklage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0925966/","name":"Bradley Whitford"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000816/","name":"Jon Avnet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088618/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303030/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0512601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0623357/","name":"Eric Nazarian"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000816/","name":"Jon Avnet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8130461/","name":"Milton Rokeach"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As a big Dinklage's fan, and considering that it was a world premiere, it was easy enough to go check it out. I'm glad I did. This movie is one about the brain and its struggles, but it does so with a big heart. It's funny and touching with a good balance, and the acting is top notch (I'm actually a bigger Dinklage's fan after the movie). The underlying themes about psychiatry as science and its potential negative effect on personality, the nature of identity, the complex interaction of desire and fear are inhabiting the film and are as relevant today as they were at the time. In summary, a great entertaining movie with a deeper layer... and a stellar Dinklage!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1910,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-01-03","keywords":"patient,sex scene,based on true story","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Three Christs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4280205081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0YjRmZGItOTgwZi00NzM1LWEwOWItMTcwYzUxMTM5YzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0YjRmZGItOTgwZi00NzM1LWEwOWItMTcwYzUxMTM5YzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227759/","name":"Peter Dinklage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0925966/","name":"Bradley Whitford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000816/","name":"Jon Avnet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088618/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303030/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0512601/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0623357/","name":"Eric Nazarian","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000816/","name":"Jon Avnet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8130461/","name":"Milton Rokeach"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The mall is now closing forever.."","reviewBody":"How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.\n\nThe movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.\n\nSeeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.\n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.\n\nAs Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.\n\nRhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.\n\nFirst time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.\n\nThe horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.\n\nAll to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'\n\nHowever, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.\n\nIt's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.\n\nIt's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.\n\nGood acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.\n\n8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":246662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror"],"datePublished":"2004-06-02","keywords":"survival horror,mall,nurse,shopping mall,zombie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Zack Snyder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1692647449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"From 'Dawn of the Dead' and '300' to 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' and 'Army of the Dead,' we break down the stunning visual trademarks of director Zack Snyder."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001631/","name":"Sarah Polley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001616/","name":"Mekhi Phifer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086710/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010962/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013658/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

The mall is now closing forever.."","reviewBody":"How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.\n\nThe movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.\n\nSeeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.\n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.\n\nAs Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.\n\nRhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another.

Think "Chocolat". Think "Amelie". Think "What dreams may come". Perhaps even, "Being John Malkovich". And this year, it's time to think big... "Big Fish", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H"agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.\n\nAfter cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of "Big Fish: The Animated Series" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories?

Ignore the highfalutin critics and watch this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-06-19","keywords":"remake,italian remake,remake of chilean film,italian remake of chilean film,f rated","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390539801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljNzU4NzQtZTY4MS00Zjg2LTlhNWEtNGY1MThjZDM2MDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljNzU4NzQtZTY4MS00Zjg2LTlhNWEtNGY1MThjZDM2MDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"A woman seeking treatment for her stress, suddenly finds herself unable to filter herself when she speaks.

But "Finding Nemo" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the "Toy Story" movies and in "Monsters Inc.," but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.\n\nHumor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in "Finding Nemo," as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of "Far Side" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.\n\nFar from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.\n\nThe story employs the same basic formula used in "Toy Story," in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.\n\nOf course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, "Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat." That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":988305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-03","keywords":"pufferfish,shark,great barrier reef,short term memory loss,protective father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2687214105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home.

Kevin Kline is perfectly cast in spirit as the songwriter extraordinaire who stormed Broadway as Hollywood beckoned. His marriage to Linda Porter (a terrific Ashley Judd) is a relationship of lasting love fraught with infidelity and heartbreak in which Porter is portrayed as an insatiable artist whose homoerotic dalliances were legend. The timeline spans the 1920's through the 1950's. This is not so much a simple biopic but, rather, an interesting depiction of Porter's constant struggle to find happiness in love and life and it proves to be an addictive intoxication. As his accepting and understanding wife grows increasingly frustrated with his lies and deception amid his growing list of male suitors, Porter's life and health begin to unravel. \n\nServing as a framework for the life events is a curious narration of sorts by an aged Porter and a mysterious host/angel (a nice theatrical turn by Jonathan Pryce). This bracketing narration is reminiscent of A Christmas Carol, and there are striking similarities to the classic All That Jazz in narrative and tone. The main story is told in a series of mini-vignettes; some scenes are almost too brief. Then there are the songs. It is truly phenomenal just how many wonderful Porter songs became standards. The recreations of many of his top hits are interspersed throughout the film and are performed often by top vocalists including some amusing cameos by Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Alanis Morissette, and Natalie Cole. The songs serve to parallel and punctuate the life events throughout the story in much the same way paintings served as a co-narrative in Frieda.\n\nAlthough production values are good for a period and location piece, it feels a little less grand in scope than it ought to be. Perhaps that works in the films favor as a more intimate story. Standout credit goes to the makeup effects especially showing the aging of Kevin Kline's character. The camera work and editing are imaginative especially in a series of circular tracking shots which seamlessly meld one timeframe with another.

Kevin Kline is perfectly cast in spirit as the songwriter extraordinaire who stormed Broadway as Hollywood beckoned. His marriage to Linda Porter (a terrific Ashley Judd) is a relationship of lasting love fraught with infidelity and heartbreak in which Porter is portrayed as an insatiable artist whose homoerotic dalliances were legend. The timeline spans the 1920's through the 1950's. This is not so much a simple biopic but, rather, an interesting depiction of Porter's constant struggle to find happiness in love and life and it proves to be an addictive intoxication. As his accepting and understanding wife grows increasingly frustrated with his lies and deception amid his growing list of male suitors, Porter's life and health begin to unravel. \n\nServing as a framework for the life events is a curious narration of sorts by an aged Porter and a mysterious host/angel (a nice theatrical turn by Jonathan Pryce). This bracketing narration is reminiscent of A Christmas Carol, and there are striking similarities to the classic All That Jazz in narrative and tone. The main story is told in a series of mini-vignettes; some scenes are almost too brief. Then there are the songs. It is truly phenomenal just how many wonderful Porter songs became standards. The recreations of many of his top hits are interspersed throughout the film and are performed often by top vocalists including some amusing cameos by Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Alanis Morissette, and Natalie Cole. The songs serve to parallel and punctuate the life events throughout the story in much the same way paintings served as a co-narrative in Frieda.\n\nAlthough production values are good for a period and location piece, it feels a little less grand in scope than it ought to be. Perhaps that works in the films favor as a more intimate story. Standout credit goes to the makeup effects especially showing the aging of Kevin Kline's character. The camera work and editing are imaginative especially in a series of circular tracking shots which seamlessly meld one timeframe with another. The music is timeless and enjoyable even when sung in pedestrian fashion by Kline. And regarding Kline, he deserves an Oscar nomination for a richly etched portrait of a tortured soul whose search for true love spanned his entire life. Perhaps in the hands of Bob Fosse or Baz Luhrmann, this could have really launched into a wildly imaginative send-off of a musical genius, but director Irwin Winkler (a respected producer turned director like Alan Pakula) has done Cole Porter proud.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11195,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H"agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.\n\nAfter cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of "Big Fish: The Animated Series" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories?

Upon watching, I discovered that The Way Back is not a purely basketball film but a story of a man stumbling through life and using the sport as a branch to prevent him from hitting the ground.\n\nBen Affleck puts a on compelling performance of a man battling his demons and despite basketball managing to bring some happiness into his life, he can never trully heal his scars. Considering how difficult it is to get creative with sports movies, through its narrative, this film manages to put its own touch which will make basketball fans enjoy the grit, realism and attitude towards the game. Music deserves a separate mention as it adds impact to the dramatic nature of the film.\n\n#moviesshmovies","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39986,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2020-03-06","keywords":"alcoholism,basketball movie,basketball coach,cemetery,underdog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2639839001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzYmVkY2QtNTZlMy00MzE4LWE3NDktZWEzMGE2MjZmZmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzYmVkY2QtNTZlMy00MzE4LWE3NDktZWEzMGE2MjZmZmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) once had a life filled with promise. In high school, he was a basketball phenom with a full university scholarship, when suddenly, for reasons unknown, he walked away from the game, forfeiting his future. Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself. As the boys start to come together as a team and win, Jack may have finally found a reason to confront the demons that have derailed him.

Kevin Kline is perfectly cast in spirit as the songwriter extraordinaire who stormed Broadway as Hollywood beckoned. His marriage to Linda Porter (a terrific Ashley Judd) is a relationship of lasting love fraught with infidelity and heartbreak in which Porter is portrayed as an insatiable artist whose homoerotic dalliances were legend. The timeline spans the 1920's through the 1950's. This is not so much a simple biopic but, rather, an interesting depiction of Porter's constant struggle to find happiness in love and life and it proves to be an addictive intoxication. As his accepting and understanding wife grows increasingly frustrated with his lies and deception amid his growing list of male suitors, Porter's life and health begin to unravel. \n\nServing as a framework for the life events is a curious narration of sorts by an aged Porter and a mysterious host/angel (a nice theatrical turn by Jonathan Pryce). This bracketing narration is reminiscent of A Christmas Carol, and there are striking similarities to the classic All That Jazz in narrative and tone. The main story is told in a series of mini-vignettes; some scenes are almost too brief. Then there are the songs. It is truly phenomenal just how many wonderful Porter songs became standards. The recreations of many of his top hits are interspersed throughout the film and are performed often by top vocalists including some amusing cameos by Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Alanis Morissette, and Natalie Cole. The songs serve to parallel and punctuate the life events throughout the story in much the same way paintings served as a co-narrative in Frieda.\n\nAlthough production values are good for a period and location piece, it feels a little less grand in scope than it ought to be. Perhaps that works in the films favor as a more intimate story. Standout credit goes to the makeup effects especially showing the aging of Kevin Kline's character. The camera work and editing are imaginative especially in a series of circular tracking shots which seamlessly meld one timeframe with another. The music is timeless and enjoyable even when sung in pedestrian fashion by Kline. And regarding Kline, he deserves an Oscar nomination for a richly etched portrait of a tortured soul whose search for true love spanned his entire life. Perhaps in the hands of Bob Fosse or Baz Luhrmann, this could have really launched into a wildly imaginative send-off of a musical genius, but director Irwin Winkler (a respected producer turned director like Alan Pakula) has done Cole Porter proud."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11195,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162821,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

She's in for a rude awakening when her bosses team her with Mike Chadway, a hardcore TV personality who promises to spill the ugly truth on what makes men and women tick. Although I think the movie is a little predictable and with some corny moments, it is also very enjoyable and funny.

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

    <desc lang="hr">Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija"Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka. Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija "Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka u potrazi za ljubavlju, stabilnom vezom, razumjevanjem, seksom... Carrie Bradshaw je njujorška novinarka koja svoja opažanja o ljubavi i strasti objavljuje u kolumni "Seks i grad". Inspiracije joj ne nedostaje, jer sve što mora jeste saslušati svoje prijateljice dok joj se povjeravaju ili prepričavaju svoj posljednji izlazak. Uz nju su Samantha, vlasnica PR agencije, koja je na samačkoj sceni vidjela i isprobala sve, galeristica Charlotte koja još vjeruje da ljubav pobjeđuje sve i cinična Miranda, advokatica u velikoj kompaniji koja ima najmanje vremena za romanse, jer joj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života. Tema za Carriene kolumne je i Faca, zgodni i misteriozni tajkun koji joj uvijek ubrza otkucaje srca. Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon i Sarah Jessica Parker uče nas važne lekcije o seksu, ljubavi, muškim i ženskim tajnama, uspješnim i neuspješnim taktikama, ispunjenim očekivanjima, skrivenim strahovima. Kada su u pitanju muškarci, veze i odnosi, ne možemo a da se ne zapitamo - da li smo zaista naučili sve?</desc>

We've found a new hit show!","reviewBody":"LOL. I know. The title of this post is too cliché, but I couldn't resist. In any case, I found the pilot of "Eureka" to be totally refreshing. The makers of the show took issues and aspects of long standing science fiction, added a new twist and location, and a ton of humour, creating in the process a fun new show that both amuses and mystifies.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed seeing science fiction elements that have been proved interesting, stimulating, and well liked in the past. Throughout it all, while not too much language was used that I consider far above my own understanding, it still gave me the impression of "Hmmm... They know what they are talking about. Maybe some of this really is possible." I love that about television shows.\n\nLeaving behind the sci fi subject matter, I was also impressed with the acting within and writing of the show. The pilot showed a serious side, with veins of humour throughout. The acting showed great compatibility and believability of the characters. I found myself liking some characters and getting annoyed at others. I love being drawn into a show like that.\n\nAlthough some things can be considered predictable, and indeed I guessed a number of things before they happened or were revealed, I was still held in suspense and laughing from beginning to end. I can't wait to see more, and I totally recommend this show to everyone I come across. I think you all will enjoy it just as much as I did.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50809,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-07-18","keywords":"scientist,problem solving,pacific northwest,small town,alternate reality","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272399/","name":"Colin Ferguson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724757/","name":"Salli Richardson-Whitfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1569714/","name":"Erica Cerra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184676/","name":"Andrew Cosby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1958727/","name":"Jaime Paglia"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eureka: The Complete Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3793855769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Eureka: The Complete Series"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

By S4 mid-point, its turned into the most dreadful, ham-acted, soap opera where the artifact mysteries are largely overwhelmed by the childish acting - especially Pete who appears to have gone from being slightly immature macho man to an emotional 7yrs old. He reminds me a lot of Seeley Booth in Bones on a bad acting day.\n\nEven Myky is suffering from the same affliction - she was the sensible one and now is hyper/silly girl which doesn't sit well. These two are meant to be top notch Secret Service agents in their late 20s for heaven's sake, not Buffy extras.\n\nI can only assume the writing team has changed, or the producers are aiming at a younger/less demanding demographic.

As Artemis and Hunter slowly build trust, she discovers that he is part of a team led by the Admiral (Ron Perlman). Facing a danger so great it could threaten to destroy their world, the brave warriors combine their unique abilities to band together for the ultimate showdown.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1388074/","name":"Tony Jaa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

Well, maybe I was in for a surprise. You never know. So I took the risk and rented the film. But in the first moments of the film, I noticed that this one was not different at all - it was just another brick in the wall.\n\nTo begin with, apart from the differences of sex and looks there's nothing to really differentiate the characters in this film. Other films are able to provide simple characters (even if one-dimensional ones) with whom we can identify with. This film gives us a very superficial glimpse of the characters, their relationships, conflicts.. What we see in "All the boys love Mandy Lane" is just a bunch of stereotyped American teenagers like we've seen so many times before.\n\nAnd how is Mandy Lane? Mandy Lane, as portrayed by Amber Heard, is just your typical high school girl. There are many girls like her - in any high school there are dozens of Mandy Lanes. Amber Heard has nothing really distinctive about her. She's pretty, that's all. Then, why do all the boys love Mandy Lane? This is a film, that's why.\n\nThat said, let's go to the film. As you well know, all the guys are mad about Mandy Lane. The boys (with the help of the girls) prepare a party. Mandy Lane is invited to this party. The party is to take place in an isolated ranch. No one had succeeded till now in scoring Mandy. The objective of this party is to ease things out. A girl in the group wants to make it with a guy, there are rivalries, frustrations, and last but not least, there's someone that loves Mandy so much that he/she is ready to kill for her. But make no mistake, anyone will guess from the beginning who the killer is, but prepare yourself for a wild twist that will put everything upside down.\n\nIf the script had managed to give us flesh and body characters and describe in more detail the relationship among the characters (their emotions, their conflicts...), this film could have been a memorable slasher teen flick. Had the film been done in the right way, there would be in it a growing sense of fear, of encirclement. Conflicts, fights, suspicion, and death advancing on and on.. outside just the empty fields... but the film is unable to build up the suspense. \n\n"All the boys love Mandy Lane" is just a passable entertainment and nothing more. If you want to see a film with more substance try "High Tension" (Haute Tension), a very good french slasher flick.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32321,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-10-15","keywords":"female nudity,teenage sexuality,mystery killer,cheerleader practice,serial killer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1243326745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MTE4NTMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcyNzAxMDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MTE4NTMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcyNzAxMDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of high-schoolers invite Mandy Lane, a good girl who became quite hot over the summer, to a weekend party on a secluded ranch.

The dialogue is deeply cheesy and often terrible. The special effects are atrocious. And season four has developed the unfortunate habit of winking to its fans a little too often.\n\nAnd yet, the whole thing has such effusive love both in front of and behind the camera that I can't help but be caught up by it. The actors are clearly having the time of their lives with goofy material, and that enthusiasm is infectious. WayHaught is one of the best ships in recent memory not just because it's fairly well-written, but because Dominique Provost-Chalkley and Katherine Barrell are clearly invested in their characters and doing right by them. And no matter how corny or ridiculous Wynonna's antics become, Melanie Scrofano anchors the show with her fearless performance.\n\nIn short, the definition of guilty pleasure TV. Give it at least the first five episodes to hit its stride and don't take it too seriously - it certainly doesn't - by then you won't even think about looking back.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"based on comic,lesbian,lesbian relationship,idw comics,wyatt earp","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234276/","name":"Melanie Scrofano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747653/","name":"Tim Rozon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3176450/","name":"Dominique Provost-Chalkley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202933/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wynonna Earp Season Two","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi16366361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everyone has demons, but hers are real."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Wynonna Earp: With Melanie Scrofano, Tim Rozon, Dominique Provost-Chalkley, Katherine Barrell.

The dialogue is deeply cheesy and often terrible. The special effects are atrocious. And season four has developed the unfortunate habit of winking to its fans a little too often.\n\nAnd yet, the whole thing has such effusive love both in front of and behind the camera that I can't help but be caught up by it. The actors are clearly having the time of their lives with goofy material, and that enthusiasm is infectious. WayHaught is one of the best ships in recent memory not just because it's fairly well-written, but because Dominique Provost-Chalkley and Katherine Barrell are clearly invested in their characters and doing right by them. And no matter how corny or ridiculous Wynonna's antics become, Melanie Scrofano anchors the show with her fearless performance.\n\nIn short, the definition of guilty pleasure TV. Give it at least the first five episodes to hit its stride and don't take it too seriously - it certainly doesn't - by then you won't even think about looking back.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"based on comic,lesbian,lesbian relationship,idw comics,wyatt earp","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234276/","name":"Melanie Scrofano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747653/","name":"Tim Rozon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3176450/","name":"Dominique Provost-Chalkley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202933/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wynonna Earp Season Two","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi16366361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everyone has demons, but hers are real."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We've found a new hit show!","reviewBody":"LOL. I know. The title of this post is too cliché, but I couldn't resist. In any case, I found the pilot of "Eureka" to be totally refreshing. The makers of the show took issues and aspects of long standing science fiction, added a new twist and location, and a ton of humour, creating in the process a fun new show that both amuses and mystifies.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed seeing science fiction elements that have been proved interesting, stimulating, and well liked in the past. Throughout it all, while not too much language was used that I consider far above my own understanding, it still gave me the impression of "Hmmm... They know what they are talking about. Maybe some of this really is possible." I love that about television shows.\n\nLeaving behind the sci fi subject matter, I was also impressed with the acting within and writing of the show. The pilot showed a serious side, with veins of humour throughout. The acting showed great compatibility and believability of the characters. I found myself liking some characters and getting annoyed at others.
