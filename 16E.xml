It was better than I initially thought that it would be. I think that it touched on a subject that seems to be taboo in today's society. I will admit that the character Kenya had major issues to deal with, and she did't give Simon a fair shake in the beginning. She did however portray how African American women relate to each other and how most of us feel about the taboo that is interracial dating. There were many times in the movie when I really felt sorry for the way she behaved towards this genuinely nice guy. I did like the way the relationship developed, it wasn't forced and it didn't seem fake. It dealt with a lot of issues from both sides. I must admit that I watched it more than once because I thought it was that good. it teaches you to be open to other options, don't limit yourself because you might miss out on something great.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12865,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was better than I initially thought that it would be. I think that it touched on a subject that seems to be taboo in today's society. I will admit that the character Kenya had major issues to deal with, and she did't give Simon a fair shake in the beginning. She did however portray how African American women relate to each other and how most of us feel about the taboo that is interracial dating. There were many times in the movie when I really felt sorry for the way she behaved towards this genuinely nice guy. I did like the way the relationship developed, it wasn't forced and it didn't seem fake. It dealt with a lot of issues from both sides. I must admit that I watched it more than once because I thought it was that good. it teaches you to be open to other options, don't limit yourself because you might miss out on something great.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12865,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I liked it.","reviewBody":"STARSKY &amp; HUTCH\n\nI had seen this film for sale in my local DVD shop so cheap that I had to buy it. Everyone I had spoken to that had seen it had told me that this film was terrible. Every review I had read about it says it is really bad  but my attitude towards it was "How bad can it be?". The truth is  I actually quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other, but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.\n\nThe comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good, but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.\n\nThe action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid, Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard. It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car  I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show, but I know the car. During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming.

I liked it.","reviewBody":"STARSKY &amp; HUTCH\n\nI had seen this film for sale in my local DVD shop so cheap that I had to buy it. Everyone I had spoken to that had seen it had told me that this film was terrible. Every review I had read about it says it is really bad  but my attitude towards it was "How bad can it be?". The truth is  I actually quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other, but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.\n\nThe comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good, but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.\n\nThe action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid, Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard. It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car  I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show, but I know the car. During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming. These are awesome, but it is a shame to see the lovely cars getting smashed up.\n\nI like the actors in this movie. The film stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These guys are funny guys, but sometimes it just doesn't work. I thought Ben played his part well and Owen played his part well too, but for some reason the chemistry between them both felt like something was missing.

It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith.

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":336857,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Films like "Children of Men", "Looper", and "The Road" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : "Children of Men" was an ode to life, "Looper" felt a lot like a modern-day western, "The Road" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, "Elysium", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "District 9", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.\n\n"Elysium" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.\n\nThe first third of "Elysium" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in "District 9". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in "District 9", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in "Elysium". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.\n\nThen the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.\n\nOverall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while "Elysium" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of "Elysium", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":424635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date.

The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production.

But it's as full of the feel-good factor as anything else in this genre and worth seeing for that alone.\n\nKristin Scott Thomas is pitch-perfect as the posh colonel's wife whose vision of the kind of choir they need is at odds with that of the newly-promoted sergeant-major's missus (Sharon Horgan, also spot-on).\n\nThe rehearsals and performance scenes are not as much fun as those in SISTER ACT, and the women aren't as engaging as THE CALENDAR GIRLS were, but the director, Peter Cattaneo, who gave us THE FULL MONTY in 1997, brings the same full-heartedness to this belated follow-up. Predictable or not, the widowing of one of the women is very movingly presented, and the finale in the Albert Hall should bring a tear to the flintiest eye. It brought one to mine.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4012,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But it's as full of the feel-good factor as anything else in this genre and worth seeing for that alone.\n\nKristin Scott Thomas is pitch-perfect as the posh colonel's wife whose vision of the kind of choir they need is at odds with that of the newly-promoted sergeant-major's missus (Sharon Horgan, also spot-on).\n\nThe rehearsals and performance scenes are not as much fun as those in SISTER ACT, and the women aren't as engaging as THE CALENDAR GIRLS were, but the director, Peter Cattaneo, who gave us THE FULL MONTY in 1997, brings the same full-heartedness to this belated follow-up. Predictable or not, the widowing of one of the women is very movingly presented, and the finale in the Albert Hall should bring a tear to the flintiest eye. It brought one to mine.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4012,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThe complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child. And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.\n\n Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any 'real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that 'one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.\n\nThe Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.\n\nHowever it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.\n\nBut if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThe complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child. And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.\n\n Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any 'real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that 'one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.\n\nThe Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.\n\nHowever it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.\n\nBut if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!) Go see this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!) Go see this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!)

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At one time, Dick Cavett said Ali was his best friend; their affinity barrels through the screen.\n\nCavett's respectful, sophisticated, witty and honest conversations about life, race, religion, and political injustice with Ali highlight the goodheartedness and intelligence of his guest. Ali's entertaining boosting and light and serious poetry give us a glimpse of the remarkable conscientious objector who embodied his moral code.\n\n"There are probably no great compliments that I can pay my next guest that he hasn't already paid himself but I happily join him and millions of others. He is without a doubt one of the greatest sports figures the world has ever known. Just in case he can hear me, he is the greatest sports figure-charming, good looking and a heck of a nice guy." Dick Cavett introducing Ali.\n\n"They seemed to go to the edge of the racial debate in this country," recalls Reverend Al Sharpton of the interviews.\n\nExtraordinary footage of Ali in and out of the ring, having sleepovers with Dick Cavett, and speaking at events, gives a powerful snapshot of his life. Ali, said by some to be a mouthpiece for the Nation of Islam, challenged the U.S. government's attempt to draft him. In June 1967, Ali was convicted of violating the Selective Service Act and was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $100,000 for objecting to fighting in the Vietnam War.\n\n"I ain't got nothing against them Vietcong." ~ Muhammad Ali\n\nAfter he won his gold medal, Ali went to a diner in his hometown and was denied service. After that, he spoke up potently, insistently, and often poetically for civil rights. Ali told Cavett how much Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X meant to him.\n\nCavett, concerned about the government claims against him for objecting to be drafted, asked if Ali was ready to go prison; he was.\n\nPresident Johnson's three member Presidential Draft Board ruled Ali's objection to be invalid and that he was not entitled to conscientious objector status as a minister of the Islamic religion. In April 1966 Ali wrote his local draft board protesting that two years of military service would cause him serious financial loss in being unable to pursue his livelihood as a boxer.\n\nHe was stripped of his boxing license by the State of New York and title by the World Boxing Association when he converted to Islam. The World Boxing Council, however, recognized him as champ throughout his battle with the Government.\n\nWhen, trembling from Parkinson's disease, he carried the Olympic torch at the 1996 games in Atlanta, Ali, a legend, represented strength in hard times and a beacon of light who stood for his convictions of freedom and equality.\n\n"But I think it almost had nothing to do with boxing. It had to do with him. He was this beautiful, charismatic, dynamic person who could've done anything." Cavett on Ali\n\nCassius Clay, who took boxing lessons after a bully stole his bicycle as a kid, was 29 and 0 when they took his title away. Nobody ever hit him or knocked him down. When he came back after over three years away in his prime, his fight with Joe Frazier was dubbed "The Fight of the Century." Frazier won in fifteen rounds. Ali ended his career being 56 - 5, but still the greatest.\n\nSome quotes by Ali ~\n\n"You can't hit what you can't see; I float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!"\n\n"The hype was part of my job, like skipping rope."\n\n"Cassius Clay is a slave name. I didn't choose it, and I didn't want it. I am Muhammad Ali, a free name, and I insist people using it when speaking to me and of me."\n\nMohammad Ali received the Otto Yamaoka peace medal for his "life-long engagement in the American civil rights movement and the global cultural emancipation of blacks, as well as his work as a UN Goodwill ambassador."\n\nWell deserved. I already respected Muhammad Ali, but came away from this film with the highest admiration of the man. I highly recommend this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Documentary","Sport","Talk-Show"],"datePublished":"2020-02-28","keywords":"produced by director,sports documentary,heavyweight boxer,muslim man,talk show host","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000738/","name":"Muhammad Ali","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107736/","name":"Jimmy Breslin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1920738/","name":"Robert S.

Well. You won't see anything of it, not a single known place, nothing. You won't hear no one speaking with the typical local accent. So, if it would be the dullest place in France, it wouldn't make any difference. But as the series itself is dull, it's alright... Caïn is an egocentric who lost the use of his legs by his own fault. That makes him bitter and cynical. But he still feels he is a hero. The main characters--that is the police force--are all poorly developed, and they all have a dark past; the plots are ludicrous and always very predictable. The series begin with the warning that it is not suited for persons under 10 years of age.

Well. You won't see anything of it, not a single known place, nothing. You won't hear no one speaking with the typical local accent. So, if it would be the dullest place in France, it wouldn't make any difference. But as the series itself is dull, it's alright... Caïn is an egocentric who lost the use of his legs by his own fault. That makes him bitter and cynical. But he still feels he is a hero. The main characters--that is the police force--are all poorly developed, and they all have a dark past; the plots are ludicrous and always very predictable. The series begin with the warning that it is not suited for persons under 10 years of age. I strongly believe that this is a mistake: in fact, the warning should be that the series it is not suited for persons over 10 years of age. Simply because the whole show is an insult to the viewer intelligence.

The screenplay of the movie is nicely woven and with some good twists and turns the movie will keep you glued to the screen.\n\nActing is superb and stunts are the strongest factor of the movie as the movie is full of stunts. Cinematography is beautiful and locations are also very beautiful.\n\nOverall a great movie of the franchise and a must watch for all the action lovers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":349143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The screenplay of the movie is nicely woven and with some good twists and turns the movie will keep you glued to the screen.\n\nActing is superb and stunts are the strongest factor of the movie as the movie is full of stunts.

Komedija o velikoj sretnoj obitelji i njezinim neugodnim, često urnebesnim i na koncu prekrasnim trenucima viđenima kroz oči njezinih pripadnika. Srednje dijete Matt napokon se oženilo svojom istinskom ljubavi Colleen. Odlučni su pod svaku cijenu dobiti dijete. Tetošeni najmlađi brat Greg i njegova žena Jen ne mogu naći ravnotežu između posla, odgoja malog djeteta i priprema za drugo dijete.

    <title lang="hr">Navy CIS LA</title>
    <desc lang="hr">NCIS Los Angeles je serija o istraživanju zločina učinjenih protiv članova ratne mornarice. Specijalni agent "G" Callen kameleon je koji se pretvara u bilo koga ne bi li se infiltrirao u kriminalno podzemlje, a njegov je partner specijalni agent Sam Hanna, bivši američki Navy SEAL koji se borio u Afganistanu i Iraku. Timu pomaže sveznajuća Henrietta "Hetty" Lange koja nadgleda osoblje i zadatak joj je osigurati timu sve, od nadzornih mikrokamera do automobila. Specijalna agentica Kensi Blye, iznimno inteligentna kći ubijenog marinca, živi za adrenalin koji stvara rad na tajnome zadatku. Marty Deeks iskusan je detektiv losanđeleske policije kojega je Hetty dovela u tim. Tehnički operator Eric Beale svladao je svaki uređaj i računalo u Operacijskome centru. Analitičarka Nell Jones osvojila je poštovanje tima svojim savršeno točnim procjenama u različitim situacijama. Jedan od članova tima je i Owen Granger, stoički i katkad razdražljivi pomoćnik ravnatelja tajanstvene prošlosti poznate samo Hetty. Naoružani najnovijom high-tech opremom i redovito u situacijama opasnim po život, članovi ove usko povezane jedinice oslanjaju se jedni na druge ne bi li učinili ono što je potrebno za zaštitu nacionalnih interesa!</desc>

When Kirigi and the Order of the Hand present her with her next job she takes it and heads out to kill Mark Miller, a man who must die to account for an act committed by his grandfather years before his birth. However when she actually meets Mark and his young daughter, Elektra has a change of heart and joins the Millers to defend them from the Order?\n\nHaving seen my fair share of films I rarely find one that is totally without value, so often I'll give things a try even if I fear the worst. More often than not bad films have some good but generally fudge the mix and has some average parts that drag it down. However having seen Elektra I can honestly say that if you're looking for a template to make a bad film then this is as good a place to come as any. First of all the plot could be written on a postage stamp and it is as bad as people say. It lacked anything to make e interested and I honestly didn't care about the detail, but it would have been nice to have had a bit of development of the story. Speaking of development, don't expect any in your characters either  Elektra's past is a collection of flashbacks and "sudden waking-up" moments but nothing more than that; she is just a bit of eye-candy who will "find her heart again" at some point and the sad thing is that she is the best developed character in the film.\n\nWith such a thin frame to work within, Garner does nothing that look determined or, as she "finds her heart again", simpers and weeps for the camera. She cannot walk properly because someone has decided that "strutting" makes a woman look sexier (I blame Destiny's Child) and she has no presence at all (this from someone who continues to watch Alias even as it gets sillier and sillier). However beside Prout, Garner looks like the next big thing because Prout is so toe-curlingly awful as the cute-kid that it is a wonder that she got cast at all. Visnjic has nothing to do and it is shame that he got involved. Terence Stamp does nothing more than take the cash and support from Tagawa, Lee and others is average at best. A clue to a bad film is when it uses lesbian teasing to get the teenage boys in  it happened in 2004's Taxi and it happens here too. The direction is just as bad as the acting; the action scenes are terrible and, outside of these the film has no idea what to do and thus just rushes to the next poor action scene, loaded with poor special effects throughout.\n\nOverall this is a pretty terrible film that has nothing of value within it. The characters are poorly developed at best and none of the cast can do anything with them at all  Garner is all at sea in a collection of pouts, poses and strutting walks. The story is hollow and is the minimum needed to bring the film to the screen (and it shows). The director makes the action scenes unexciting and just a collection of poor CGI, meanwhile using music in a hamfisted attempt to make the audience have any emotional attachment with the product. Even die-hard Garner fans will struggle to enjoy this dog  January and already I think I've seen one of my least favourite films of the year."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88705,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

I think this theory is right. I was disappointed by Harry Potter 5 at first, but watching it now for a year later and nearly forgetting about the book, I found it the best in the series.\n\nThe same might as well go with this film. I was disappointed. If you don't know, this film is based on 5 books. However, the movie ignores the 4th book, which is probably because of budget issues and/or limited running time. Still, I can't help but complain. There could've been more creative production designs to see, more action, and more magical creatures.\n\nApart from that, I felt that the film was well put together, especially the fact that they skipped a lot in the books. The special effects are very good, as well as the action scenes. I also may feel this film pushed the PG rating. It certainly is not as intense as Harry Potter 3 but there might be about 2 to 3 scenes that could make this film a PG-13 rating.\n\nThe performances here are decent, although not captivating. The film may be a bit fast paced, if you asked me. Overall, this is a decent adaption to another fantasy book. If you have read the books, you might be disappointed. If you have not, enjoy it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-03-26","keywords":"gryphon,competition,boy,dancing,father figure","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Spiderwick Chronicles","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498204953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Spiderwick Chronicles Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092961/","name":"Sarah Bolger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914132/","name":"Mark Waters"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456732/","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1183854/","name":"David Berenbaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000626/","name":"John Sayles"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I think this theory is right. I was disappointed by Harry Potter 5 at first, but watching it now for a year later and nearly forgetting about the book, I found it the best in the series.\n\nThe same might as well go with this film. I was disappointed. If you don't know, this film is based on 5 books. However, the movie ignores the 4th book, which is probably because of budget issues and/or limited running time. Still, I can't help but complain. There could've been more creative production designs to see, more action, and more magical creatures.\n\nApart from that, I felt that the film was well put together, especially the fact that they skipped a lot in the books. The special effects are very good, as well as the action scenes. I also may feel this film pushed the PG rating. It certainly is not as intense as Harry Potter 3 but there might be about 2 to 3 scenes that could make this film a PG-13 rating.\n\nThe performances here are decent, although not captivating. The film may be a bit fast paced, if you asked me. Overall, this is a decent adaption to another fantasy book. If you have read the books, you might be disappointed. If you have not, enjoy it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-03-26","keywords":"gryphon,competition,boy,dancing,father figure","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Spiderwick Chronicles","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498204953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Spiderwick Chronicles Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092961/","name":"Sarah Bolger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914132/","name":"Mark Waters"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456732/","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1183854/","name":"David Berenbaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000626/","name":"John Sayles"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Good Trouble? More like Bad Decisions. Callie and Mariana continue to make one bad decision after another and they have surrounded themselves with a whole menagerie of people who do the same. They are supposed to now be a law school graduate and an MIT graduate. If they made decisions like they continue to do now while they were in college, neither would have graduated or landed their jobs. The writers are letting them down by continuing to write them as the teenage girls they were rather than the women they should have become.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5209,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-01-08","keywords":"live","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2314596/","name":"Maia Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2028116/","name":"Cierra Ramirez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5264136/","name":"Zuri Adele"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287645/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425394/","name":"Joanna Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1401678/","name":"Bradley Bredeweg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656739/","name":"Peter Paige"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Promo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi153598489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Callie and Mariana Foster move to Los Angeles and begin their lives as young adults.

But thankfully I watched it on a pirate DVD bought for two dollars from a dodgy looking bloke on Sadovaya Triumfalnaya in Moscow. He liked my girlfriend's red shoes and said they looked like the shoes of a Princess, which she is of course. I like her red shoes too, they are very nice shoes. They have embroidery and flat heels, but they got very wet when we got caught in the rain the day we went to Novospassky Monastery. Neither of us had a jacket or an umbrella so we got pretty wet but it was worth it because the monastery is beautiful. If you ever go to Moscow you should pay this place a visit, it's stunningly beautiful. Go to Taganskaya on the Circular line and it's a five minute walk along Kamenshiki Street, or at least it should be if you go with someone who knows how to read a street map. Still, it was a nice walk in the rain and we got there eventually even though the red shoes got very wet. Now, being that Novospassky is a Russian Orthodox monastery, women must cover their heads and must also cover their shoulders and should not be wearing trousers or short skirts. Red shoes are OK. So just inside the main gate there is a big box of scarves, shawls and wrap around skirts for the use of any women that may be unsuitably attired for entry into the church, and I must say that my beautiful girlfriend looked rather wonderful wearing all these things. I have pictures if you would like to see them. The inside of the church is decorated with painted walls and ceilings and there are stunning golden icons that look fabulous in the candlelight. There are no electric lights. The Russian choir sings and the priests walk around among the congregation, who stand and chant, there are no seats. It is one of the most spiritual experiences you'll ever have. Quite extraordinary. It is almost like being transported back to some medieval age. Anyway, why am I telling you all of this? Quite simply because it is much more interesting than talking about this movie. As I said, I, or should I say we, watched it on a dodgy pirate DVD that was on sale the day after the movie opened in Moscow. This, as it turned out, was a very good thing because it meant that I couldn't see or hear the movie very well so we turned it off after 20 minutes and that's the best way to watch it in my opinion. \n\nThe red shoes still look great though."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40196,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"duration":"PT1H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Having fallen on somewhat hard times, he, nevertheless, is reluctant to attempt his next assignment. The boss directs him to Scotland, where he is to use modern technology to PROVE once and for all that there is no Nessie Monster. There is no real choice but for Dempsey to get on a plane. When he lands, he almost drives over a pretty local lady, Laura (Joely Richardson). In short order, he finds out that she has the only rooming house and, after some begging, she lets him a room. Also in the house is her beautiful young daughter, Isabella (Kirsty Graham). Of all of the Scots, Izzy is the most welcoming to Dempsey. Hiring a boat and crew, Dempsey begins his exploration. This greatly displeases the bailiff (Ian Holm) but the lawman can do little to stop the efforts. As time goes on, no monster does appear, so Dempsey is soon ready to go back to the States. However, one day, Izzy reveals some secrets, big ones. Also, Laura, despite her outward dislike for Dempsey, may, in fact, be attracted to the brash American. Is there romance ahead? First, this film has a terrific setting, the beautiful country around Loch Ness. If you always wishes to go to Scotland but, have little money and big flying anxieties, you will be enchanted with the view. Then, the main actors are quite good, with Danson doing a variation of his smug humor and Richardson looking great and sporting a fine accent. Holm, Graham and all of the others support them nicely. The production also features fine costumes, an arresting script, gorgeous photography and a steady direction. In short, look for Loch, you fans of romance and family-friendly features.

Having fallen on somewhat hard times, he, nevertheless, is reluctant to attempt his next assignment. The boss directs him to Scotland, where he is to use modern technology to PROVE once and for all that there is no Nessie Monster. There is no real choice but for Dempsey to get on a plane. When he lands, he almost drives over a pretty local lady, Laura (Joely Richardson). In short order, he finds out that she has the only rooming house and, after some begging, she lets him a room. Also in the house is her beautiful young daughter, Isabella (Kirsty Graham). Of all of the Scots, Izzy is the most welcoming to Dempsey. Hiring a boat and crew, Dempsey begins his exploration. This greatly displeases the bailiff (Ian Holm) but the lawman can do little to stop the efforts. As time goes on, no monster does appear, so Dempsey is soon ready to go back to the States. However, one day, Izzy reveals some secrets, big ones. Also, Laura, despite her outward dislike for Dempsey, may, in fact, be attracted to the brash American. Is there romance ahead? First, this film has a terrific setting, the beautiful country around Loch Ness. If you always wishes to go to Scotland but, have little money and big flying anxieties, you will be enchanted with the view. Then, the main actors are quite good, with Danson doing a variation of his smug humor and Richardson looking great and sporting a fine accent. Holm, Graham and all of the others support them nicely. The production also features fine costumes, an arresting script, gorgeous photography and a steady direction. In short, look for Loch, you fans of romance and family-friendly features. It's lovely.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1996-02-09","keywords":"nessie,loch,monster,scientist,loch ness","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001101/","name":"Ted Danson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000613/","name":"Joely Richardson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000453/","name":"Ian Holm"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0376487/","name":"John Henderson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299301/","name":"John Fusco"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

These are two very talented and funny actors, and I was hoping for something amusing when these two were put together on screen. Without further ado, I have to say that What's Your Number is lowest common denominator garbage. The film has only reprehensible characters and only bad things to say about them. It's the type of movie where no one person can have a conversation without talking about some sort of sexual activity. Humorist Erma Bombeck once had a quote that went "There is a thin line that separates laughter and pain, comedy and tragedy, humor and hurt." Unfortunately, What's Your Number is only the latter. This film feels like it doesn't even care, and therefore doesn't even try to get any laughs, and it doesn't. Not one laugh is presented in this film, not one smile is earned in this film, and a lot of anger is deserved in this film. What's Your Number goes through the cliché cycles that every other romantic comedy has been through this year. What's the point to all of this? Why waste millions of dollars and talented people to just make the same old same old? Why do movies like this get green lit? These are all questions that should be asked from studios after having seen What's Your Number."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

These are two very talented and funny actors, and I was hoping for something amusing when these two were put together on screen. Without further ado, I have to say that What's Your Number is lowest common denominator garbage. The film has only reprehensible characters and only bad things to say about them. It's the type of movie where no one person can have a conversation without talking about some sort of sexual activity. Humorist Erma Bombeck once had a quote that went "There is a thin line that separates laughter and pain, comedy and tragedy, humor and hurt." Unfortunately, What's Your Number is only the latter. This film feels like it doesn't even care, and therefore doesn't even try to get any laughs, and it doesn't. Not one laugh is presented in this film, not one smile is earned in this film, and a lot of anger is deserved in this film. What's Your Number goes through the cliché cycles that every other romantic comedy has been through this year. What's the point to all of this? Why waste millions of dollars and talented people to just make the same old same old? Why do movies like this get green lit? These are all questions that should be asked from studios after having seen What's Your Number.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Better than the 1953 classic in some ways","reviewBody":"First - a quick rebuttal: The peanut butter sandwich which seemed to stick to the window impossibly. This was a very visually interesting scene. In fact, the scene was shot from inside the house, and Cruise was shot in reflection against the window - so there is no problem here other than the reviewer not thinking what they were seeing through.\n\nNow on to the review...\n\nThis film follows Tom Cruise - playing a not-very-adult divorced father - and his two kids through the Wellsian version of The War of the Worlds. Despite the fact that the film focuses exclusively on the harrowing experiences of this somewhat dysfunctional family, in a very basic way it preserves the elements of the original novel. As with Wells' book, a science savvy viewer will pick up on the biological plausibility of the main plot and realize the brilliance of Wells original points. Scientifically educated viewers will also recognize the geological impossibility of it. Neither of these facts should detract from the entertainment value of this interesting and exciting film. After all, it is a testament to Wells' genius that a novel written nearly 100 years ago still holds our attention today, and is still regarded as an intelligent take on improbable events.\n\nAn alien species, about which nothing is really known, has been planning to take over and terraform earth for millenia, or perhaps much longer. Using unknown technology, they manage to emplace operatives in enormous tripod machines equipped with horrendous weapons that basically carbonize any life forms they take aim at. The tripods had been implanted deep in the earth long before the advent of our species. There simply is no stopping the invasion. Cruise, whose character is not really built for heroism, digs deep into his soul to protect his children as they attempt to make it to Boston to reunite with his estranged wife and her new family.\n\nBefore I discuss the technical merits of the film, and the lavish production values, I feel that I need to make a comment on Dakota Fanning. Ms. Fanning gives one of the best performances I have ever seen a sub-12 year old give in The War of the Worlds. She is a match for Cruise, and actually manages to steal several scenes from him. The acting in this film is uniformly good, but Fanning really stood out.\n\nSpielberg and his team make seemingly impossible film visions come alive in a uniquely well realized manner. War of the Worlds is one of the most visually stunning films I have seen in a long time. Though I would not call the special effects innovative, they are, more importantly, convincing and never over-done. The nearly first person story telling technique is both original and effective, and the non-heroism of Cruise's character makes for a much more compelling plot than I expected to see. There are indeed some problems with believability, but let me ask - why would anybody go to this film expecting something more realistic than a fairy tale?\n\nRecommended for Wells fans, fans of the original 1953 adaptation, and action sci-fi fans. Mildly recommended to the average cinema-goer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":423565,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Approach with low expectations, and you'll be moderately satisfied.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8754,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1992-03-06","keywords":"hood,jockstrap,boxing,debt,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gladiator (1992)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1202323737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhNjJmMmEtYzg1NS00NWY2LWFmNmYtMjU4YmRhNmQ1MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhNjJmMmEtYzg1NS00NWY2LWFmNmYtMjU4YmRhNmQ1MDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338614/","name":"James Marshall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001133/","name":"Brian Dennehy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0380705/","name":"Rowdy Herrington"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038243/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587429/","name":"Djordje Milicevic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436543/","name":"Robert Mark Kamen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0450361/","name":"Lyle Kessler"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I went to see it with a Japanese friend, and she loved it too.\n\nSo the plot wasn't full of 'save the world' ambitions and the good guy wasn't a millionaire playboy, but who cares? It was a gorgeous straightforward film about two people meeting at a certain time in their lives.\n\nI read a quote recently about someone who'd seen the movie and came out wanting to hug everyone they met - and I totally agree. I cycled home humming the tunes and feeling like I haven't felt from a film since seeing 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I know, I know - totally different films - but the zen-like feeling after seeing them both...\n\nFrom a Dublin dweller, it was fun to watch the geography, as the film makers played with the locations in that certain venues were on the same street - yet it looked like the actors had to walk through town to get to them. It definitely hindered the 'who do I know in the public street' shots moments! But was interesting, as helped make Dublin be a different city to what the residents would be used to.\n\nMy recommendation is to just go and see it if you're on for seeing something uncomplicated, feel-good without being too mushy, comedic moments that everyone can relate to and some singer-songwriter music thrown in.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112282,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I went to see it with a Japanese friend, and she loved it too.\n\nSo the plot wasn't full of 'save the world' ambitions and the good guy wasn't a millionaire playboy, but who cares? It was a gorgeous straightforward film about two people meeting at a certain time in their lives.\n\nI read a quote recently about someone who'd seen the movie and came out wanting to hug everyone they met - and I totally agree. I cycled home humming the tunes and feeling like I haven't felt from a film since seeing 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I know, I know - totally different films - but the zen-like feeling after seeing them both...\n\nFrom a Dublin dweller, it was fun to watch the geography, as the film makers played with the locations in that certain venues were on the same street - yet it looked like the actors had to walk through town to get to them. It definitely hindered the 'who do I know in the public street' shots moments! But was interesting, as helped make Dublin be a different city to what the residents would be used to.\n\nMy recommendation is to just go and see it if you're on for seeing something uncomplicated, feel-good without being too mushy, comedic moments that everyone can relate to and some singer-songwriter music thrown in.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112282,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's not meant to be. It's meant to be entertaining and that's exactly what it is.","reviewBody":"When the credits started, I had a big smile on my face.\n\nWhat is your perception of 2 Guns? Whether you've seen the trailer or read the comic, you might have an idea what sort of movie this is. If so, you will be correct and happy you decided to watch it.\n\nThe big surprise many seem to have is the fact that this movie is based on the 2 GUNS comic Boom! Studios put out in 2007. I'll admit, despite the fact that I've always read a lot of Boom's comics, this series somehow completely snuck by. I did read the series before watching the movie. Whether or not you should do that, we'll get to that in minute.\n\nThe movie stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. That in itself is pretty impressive. These two actors crank up the charisma during the movie. You can't help but enjoy their presence on screen.\n\nThese two guys are planning on robbing a bank. It turns out it wasn't a simple bank and they ended up with way more than they thought. The twists and turns avalanche upon them as they discover others that are interested in the money plus the fact that they don't know each other as well as they thought. If you've watched the trailer, you probably know more about the movie than you should.\n\nWashington and Wahlberg are great together. For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable. But there are still plenty of twists to catch you off guard. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you'll even find yourself flinching or cringing a little at times.\n\nShould you or should you not read the comic first?\n\nThat really depends on how much you want to know ahead of time. Some of the twists weren't revealed in the trailers. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic, something pretty rare for a "comic book movie." There are obviously some minor differences but if you have read it before, you'll smile hearing some lines taken directly from the comic. Washington's casting is a bit of a departure. I felt as if his character and Wahlberg's were closer in age in the comic. But seeing the two together, it absolutely does not matter. These two made the movie fun.\n\nYou're probably aware this isn't a piece of fine art. It's not meant to be. Usually at this point in the summer, all the "big" Hollywood movies have been released. This is a movie that gives you a reason to go back to the theaters one more time.\n\nIt's more than just about Washington and Wahlberg. Those two could have easily carried the burden of being the box office draw. We are also treated to great performances by Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, James Marsden and Paula Patton. That's what makes the movie even more of a pleasant surprise. You get a sense that some thought and care was put into the making of this movie. Not only is it faithful to the comic, the filmmakers also made sure it had a great cast and delivered a really good quality production.\n\nThe movie is rated R. Clearly there is quite a bit of violence. There's plenty of shooting, killing and explosions. It gets a little over the top but that's what you should expect from this kind of movie. There is also some brief nudity and plenty of profanity. In other words, this isn't a family film. What it is is a movie you go see with your friends. Buy some popcorn, lean back in your seat and just enjoy the movie and have a great time.\n\nI mentioned leaving the theater with a smile. It's not a "feel good" movie. But it will make you laugh and give you a good time. That's exactly what I want for my money. It's fun and absurd with over the top action. Do I want a sequel? Boom! Studios did release 3 GUNS this week. I would indeed love to see these two return to the characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200836,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not meant to be. It's meant to be entertaining and that's exactly what it is.","reviewBody":"When the credits started, I had a big smile on my face.\n\nWhat is your perception of 2 Guns? Whether you've seen the trailer or read the comic, you might have an idea what sort of movie this is. If so, you will be correct and happy you decided to watch it.\n\nThe big surprise many seem to have is the fact that this movie is based on the 2 GUNS comic Boom! Studios put out in 2007. I'll admit, despite the fact that I've always read a lot of Boom's comics, this series somehow completely snuck by. I did read the series before watching the movie. Whether or not you should do that, we'll get to that in minute.\n\nThe movie stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. That in itself is pretty impressive. These two actors crank up the charisma during the movie. You can't help but enjoy their presence on screen.\n\nThese two guys are planning on robbing a bank. It turns out it wasn't a simple bank and they ended up with way more than they thought. The twists and turns avalanche upon them as they discover others that are interested in the money plus the fact that they don't know each other as well as they thought. If you've watched the trailer, you probably know more about the movie than you should.\n\nWashington and Wahlberg are great together. For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable. But there are still plenty of twists to catch you off guard. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you'll even find yourself flinching or cringing a little at times.\n\nShould you or should you not read the comic first?\n\nThat really depends on how much you want to know ahead of time. Some of the twists weren't revealed in the trailers. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic, something pretty rare for a "comic book movie." There are obviously some minor differences but if you have read it before, you'll smile hearing some lines taken directly from the comic. Washington's casting is a bit of a departure. I felt as if his character and Wahlberg's were closer in age in the comic. But seeing the two together, it absolutely does not matter. These two made the movie fun.\n\nYou're probably aware this isn't a piece of fine art. It's not meant to be. Usually at this point in the summer, all the "big" Hollywood movies have been released. This is a movie that gives you a reason to go back to the theaters one more time.\n\nIt's more than just about Washington and Wahlberg. Those two could have easily carried the burden of being the box office draw. We are also treated to great performances by Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, James Marsden and Paula Patton. That's what makes the movie even more of a pleasant surprise. You get a sense that some thought and care was put into the making of this movie. Not only is it faithful to the comic, the filmmakers also made sure it had a great cast and delivered a really good quality production.\n\nThe movie is rated R. Clearly there is quite a bit of violence. There's plenty of shooting, killing and explosions. It gets a little over the top but that's what you should expect from this kind of movie. There is also some brief nudity and plenty of profanity. In other words, this isn't a family film. What it is is a movie you go see with your friends. Buy some popcorn, lean back in your seat and just enjoy the movie and have a great time.\n\nI mentioned leaving the theater with a smile. It's not a "feel good" movie. But it will make you laugh and give you a good time. That's exactly what I want for my money. It's fun and absurd with over the top action. Do I want a sequel? Boom! Studios did release 3 GUNS this week. I would indeed love to see these two return to the characters.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200836,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Heck, a lot has changed since the LAST Harry Potter film was released in 2011. The franchise helped change our modern interpretation of what a film series can be. And this prequel spin-off is proof of that. While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.\n\nIn the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.\n\nThe Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them.

Heck, a lot has changed since the LAST Harry Potter film was released in 2011. The franchise helped change our modern interpretation of what a film series can be. And this prequel spin-off is proof of that. While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.\n\nIn the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.\n\nThe Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films. By the time we got to the last few Harry Potter movies, we weren't exactly looking for a brisk narrative.

Nova priča zatječe Dianu Prince kako neprimjetno živi među smrtnicima u živahnim, elegantnim 1980-ima - eri hedonizma i želje za posjedovanjem. Iako je u potpunosti razvila svoje moći, ona ostaje pritajena, bavi se prikupljanjem drevnih artefakta, a herojska djela izvodi samo potajno. Međutim, Diana će uskoro morati skupiti svu svoju snagu, mudrost i hrabrost kad se sukobi s Maxwellom Lordom i Cheetom, zlikovkom koja posjeduje nadljudsku snagu i spretnost.</desc>

Now, the better part of a decade later, the series is back, and it hasn't changed much at all. If you enjoyed the original, you'll probably like this one. If not, steer clear. That said, I enjoyed Rise of an Empire more than its predecessor, for two main reasons. The first is that I didn't know how it would end. Even before 300 came out, people knew about Thermopylae and the futile last stand that happened there. It made it too difficult to invest in the characters, and essentially forced me to sit drumming my fingers until their inevitable death. This was, fortunately, not the case here. The second reason is Eva Green. Best known for her breakout role in 2006's Casino Royale, her performance in Rise of an Empire ranges from terrifyingly understated to unintentionally comic, and steals the spotlight at every opportunity. But even she cannot hold up this movie by herself, since the film, for all its merits, relies on little more than its visual effects and art direction.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-05","keywords":"violent sex,greek,army,navy,antiquity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982128409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Greek general Themistokles attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia vengeful commander of the Persian navy."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0822982/","name":"Sullivan Stapleton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372176/","name":"Lena Headey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729171/","name":"Noam Murro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199432/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426500/","name":"Kurt Johnstad"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588340/","name":"Frank Miller"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: 300: Rise of an Empire: Directed by Noam Murro. With Sullivan Stapleton, Eva Green, Lena Headey, Hans Matheson.

Now, the better part of a decade later, the series is back, and it hasn't changed much at all. If you enjoyed the original, you'll probably like this one. If not, steer clear. That said, I enjoyed Rise of an Empire more than its predecessor, for two main reasons. The first is that I didn't know how it would end. Even before 300 came out, people knew about Thermopylae and the futile last stand that happened there. It made it too difficult to invest in the characters, and essentially forced me to sit drumming my fingers until their inevitable death. This was, fortunately, not the case here. The second reason is Eva Green. Best known for her breakout role in 2006's Casino Royale, her performance in Rise of an Empire ranges from terrifyingly understated to unintentionally comic, and steals the spotlight at every opportunity. But even she cannot hold up this movie by herself, since the film, for all its merits, relies on little more than its visual effects and art direction.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-05","keywords":"violent sex,greek,army,navy,antiquity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982128409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Greek general Themistokles attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia vengeful commander of the Persian navy.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0822982/","name":"Sullivan Stapleton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372176/","name":"Lena Headey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729171/","name":"Noam Murro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199432/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426500/","name":"Kurt Johnstad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588340/","name":"Frank Miller"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Overall Shadow is an exceptionally well made martial arts film, one that uses slow burn to a wonderful effect, never distancing itself from the viewer, but still able to build a strong hero and villain organically.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13690,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought I'd seen it all by now, but Shadow only goes to show there's probably a lot more to see. Overall Shadow is an exceptionally well made martial arts film, one that uses slow burn to a wonderful effect, never distancing itself from the viewer, but still able to build a strong hero and villain organically.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13690,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My family however, despite my best efforts, will watch the occasional episode but have never embraced the Star Trek world as I have. My husband took me along to the premier of Star Trek in London last night and thank you JJ you converted him in one film, I have been trying for 25 years!

Nova priča zatječe Dianu Prince kako neprimjetno živi među smrtnicima u živahnim, elegantnim 1980-ima - eri hedonizma i želje za posjedovanjem. Iako je u potpunosti razvila svoje moći, ona ostaje pritajena, bavi se prikupljanjem drevnih artefakta, a herojska djela izvodi samo potajno. Međutim, Diana će uskoro morati skupiti svu svoju snagu, mudrost i hrabrost kad se sukobi s Maxwellom Lordom i Cheetom, zlikovkom koja posjeduje nadljudsku snagu i spretnost.</desc>

 --- Description: Hra: Directed by Alejandro Fernández Almendras. With Vladimíra Benoni, Sarah Havacova, Sarah Hlavácová, Danica Jurcová. The world of a young theatre director in a small Czech town crumbles after he decides to realize his dream of adapting an overly ambitious play based on Euripides' classic 'Fedra'. He loses his two main actors during rehearsals and the municipality threatens to cut funding due to the play's political content. Petr falls for young actress Karolina, playing the lead. Tensions at his home grow: he's not much of a present husband and a father. Shortly before the premiere both women leave him. His wife's had enough and Karolina simply disappears. Petr attempts to save his masterpiece, but the play is a fiasco. Devastated, he tries to regain last pieces left of his life.

After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.\n\nThis is cinema at its very best.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1518045,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"duration":"PT2H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.\n\nThis is cinema at its very best.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1518045,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"duration":"PT2H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.\n\nReturn of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson.

In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin &amp; Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.\n\nThis is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)\n\nThe worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1679342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9},"duration":"PT3H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.\n\nHowever, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.\n\nOverall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.\n\nHowever, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.\n\nOverall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the kind of film that feels like it was written by an adolescent girl cherrypicking reblogged Tumblr quotes from her wall to suffice as the theme for the film. It's the kind of film you'll love if you find the idea of "getting lost to find yourself" a profound concept.\n\n"Paper Towns," finally, is the kind of film where the love interest is named Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne), whose vacuous personality is mistaken for mystery and enigma. She is defined by her absent gazes into the world, her love for "random capitalization" in her writing because "the rules are so unfair to the letters in the middle of words," and her statements about her town, Orlando, Florida, being a paper town with "paper houses and paper people." \n\nShe also happens to be the apple of Quentin's (the former "Naked Brothers Band" lead singer Nat Wolff) eye since she moved in his subdivision when they were young; he considers living next to her his sole miracle in life. However, the two have significantly drifted since their youthful days of innocence, until one night when Margo climbs into his window and says that she has nine things to do that night and needs a getaway driver. Stunned that the love of his life has waltzed through his window for the first time in years, Quentin takes Margo and peels off in his minivan to exact revenge on Margo's cheating boyfriend and her friends who didn't help her in her time of need.\n\nUpon having the greatest night of his life, Quentin wakes up the next morning and sees Margo isn't at school that day, and eventually, notices she's missing the entire week. Her parents aren't concerned, for Margo does this a lot, but Quentin and his friends - the incessant Ben (Austin Abrams) and the geeky "Radar" (Justice Smith) - begin to uncover clues as to why Margo may have disappeared and where to. With that, the three teens, including Margo's best friend Lacey (Halston Sage) and Radar's girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair), try to track down her whereabouts.\n\n"Paper Towns"'s immediate problem is it's nowhere as intelligent or witty as it thinks it is. Its themes are all rehashed to the point of breeding contempt and its characters, particularly Margo, are so broadly drawn that they work against the film, which is clearly trying to breathe that fabled freshness into the teen film genre (it always feels like Quentin's going to stop the film with his narration saying the dreaded "this isn't your average teen movie" line).\n\nStrangely, though, the most contemptible character throughout this whole film is Margo for more reasons than her empty personality. She's the kind of person who thinks it's okay to drop her friends and family without giving them any inkling as to what's wrong with her because she's trying to find herself. Finally, when somebody does something for her, particularly Quentin, she takes it with a grain of salt and goes about selfishly trying to advance herself rather than consider what she means to others. She's on the verge of growing up and being Amy Schumer's Amy character from "Trainwreck," a contemptible, lost soul who takes advantage of people she meets.\n\nFurthermore, the humor of "Paper Towns" is another thing that's frustrating. One moment, the film is trying to wow you with a "deep" dialogue about what lies beneath the surface of people, and the next, a character accidentally spills a can in which he urinated into all over himself and his friends. Once more, this is a film that's trying to be one thing but can't escape what it ultimately is: trite, frequently immature, and mostly empty exercise that has nothing revolutionary to say despite thinking it does.\n\nHowever, don't fault the cast here, for they clearly give it their best shot. Their energy and charisma bring to life more than writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (who wrote "The Spectacular Now," a film you should see instead of this one) do. Nat Wolff, an actor I've consistently admired for his good-natured, everyboy appearance and personality, does strong work here in that realm and is assisted by capable performers like Smith and Sage (Delevingne would likely be better if she had a character to play).\n\n"Paper Towns" is cut from the same cloth as "The Fault in Our Stars" (author John Green, who wrote the book on which this film is based, also wrote that one and Neustadter and Weber also penned that screenplay) in that it tries to take a different direction for its adolescent characters but crumbles under the lackluster deviations from reality it so often takes. On top of that, unlike "The Fault in Our Stars," which was burdened by sentimentality and cringeworthy attempts at a perceived coolness, "Paper Towns" winds up being precisely what it didn't want to be - a paper film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97585,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's the kind of film you'll love if you find the idea of "getting lost to find yourself" a profound concept.\n\n"Paper Towns," finally, is the kind of film where the love interest is named Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne), whose vacuous personality is mistaken for mystery and enigma. She is defined by her absent gazes into the world, her love for "random capitalization" in her writing because "the rules are so unfair to the letters in the middle of words," and her statements about her town, Orlando, Florida, being a paper town with "paper houses and paper people." \n\nShe also happens to be the apple of Quentin's (the former "Naked Brothers Band" lead singer Nat Wolff) eye since she moved in his subdivision when they were young; he considers living next to her his sole miracle in life. However, the two have significantly drifted since their youthful days of innocence, until one night when Margo climbs into his window and says that she has nine things to do that night and needs a getaway driver. Stunned that the love of his life has waltzed through his window for the first time in years, Quentin takes Margo and peels off in his minivan to exact revenge on Margo's cheating boyfriend and her friends who didn't help her in her time of need.\n\nUpon having the greatest night of his life, Quentin wakes up the next morning and sees Margo isn't at school that day, and eventually, notices she's missing the entire week. Her parents aren't concerned, for Margo does this a lot, but Quentin and his friends - the incessant Ben (Austin Abrams) and the geeky "Radar" (Justice Smith) - begin to uncover clues as to why Margo may have disappeared and where to. With that, the three teens, including Margo's best friend Lacey (Halston Sage) and Radar's girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair), try to track down her whereabouts.\n\n"Paper Towns"'s immediate problem is it's nowhere as intelligent or witty as it thinks it is. Its themes are all rehashed to the point of breeding contempt and its characters, particularly Margo, are so broadly drawn that they work against the film, which is clearly trying to breathe that fabled freshness into the teen film genre (it always feels like Quentin's going to stop the film with his narration saying the dreaded "this isn't your average teen movie" line).\n\nStrangely, though, the most contemptible character throughout this whole film is Margo for more reasons than her empty personality. She's the kind of person who thinks it's okay to drop her friends and family without giving them any inkling as to what's wrong with her because she's trying to find herself. Finally, when somebody does something for her, particularly Quentin, she takes it with a grain of salt and goes about selfishly trying to advance herself rather than consider what she means to others. She's on the verge of growing up and being Amy Schumer's Amy character from "Trainwreck," a contemptible, lost soul who takes advantage of people she meets.\n\nFurthermore, the humor of "Paper Towns" is another thing that's frustrating. One moment, the film is trying to wow you with a "deep" dialogue about what lies beneath the surface of people, and the next, a character accidentally spills a can in which he urinated into all over himself and his friends. Once more, this is a film that's trying to be one thing but can't escape what it ultimately is: trite, frequently immature, and mostly empty exercise that has nothing revolutionary to say despite thinking it does.\n\nHowever, don't fault the cast here, for they clearly give it their best shot. Their energy and charisma bring to life more than writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (who wrote "The Spectacular Now," a film you should see instead of this one) do. Nat Wolff, an actor I've consistently admired for his good-natured, everyboy appearance and personality, does strong work here in that realm and is assisted by capable performers like Smith and Sage (Delevingne would likely be better if she had a character to play).\n\n"Paper Towns" is cut from the same cloth as "The Fault in Our Stars" (author John Green, who wrote the book on which this film is based, also wrote that one and Neustadter and Weber also penned that screenplay) in that it tries to take a different direction for its adolescent characters but crumbles under the lackluster deviations from reality it so often takes. On top of that, unlike "The Fault in Our Stars," which was burdened by sentimentality and cringeworthy attempts at a perceived coolness, "Paper Towns" winds up being precisely what it didn't want to be - a paper film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97585,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few. Adonis "Donny" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series. Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies. On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out. Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle. Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason. In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nothing unique at all about this movie as a matter of fact. The hot young teens could not be more stereotyped and formulated. It was easy to guess what was coming next. \n\nAlthough, replacing the slashing moments with alien abductions was a step in the right direction, but does not make the movie.\n\nIf you catch it catch, but not worth going out of the way to see it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15347,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2014-10-17","keywords":"alien abduction,no survivors,videotape,vietnam war veteran,military cover up","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi377794329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMyNzM4OTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgxNDE4MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMyNzM4OTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgxNDE4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of friends on a weekend trip to a cabin in the woods find themselves terrorized by alien visitors.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020329/","name":"Brittany Allen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2238815/","name":"Freddie Stroma","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1536605/","name":"Jesse Moss"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4017355/","name":"Colin Minihan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0447381/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0413004/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452893/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4017355/","name":"Colin Minihan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3425513/","name":"Stuart Ortiz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4155547/","name":"The Vicious Brothers"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
