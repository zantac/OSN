One of Cage's best, and a severely under-rated film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":129311,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-05-05","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,sexual sadism,snuff film,male frontal nudity,female full frontal nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"8mm","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4078878489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZhMDc0Y2YtYTgxMi00MGRkLWEwNGMtYWE2ZGQzM2RjNDViXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZhMDc0Y2YtYTgxMi00MGRkLWEwNGMtYWE2ZGQzM2RjNDViXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Home Video Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001618/","name":"Joaquin Phoenix","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001254/","name":"James Gandolfini"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030084/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012600/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001825/","name":"Andrew Kevin Walker"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are magic on the screen and the music is sensational. My friend, Alia, from UCLA, had raved about this film and wanted me to see it, and I am so glad that I did. I found not only the music and dancing, but the story set in the jungle of a big city of young black men and a young white man struggling to survive and come up with fulfilling lives, to be a journey that is true to the lives of so many young men and women today in metropolitan cities in the USA.\n\nDuane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg have created a film in STEP UP that just hits your heart and soul with the character development created through the actors music and dance, and the sets and costumes which fit each character.

Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are magic on the screen and the music is sensational. My friend, Alia, from UCLA, had raved about this film and wanted me to see it, and I am so glad that I did. I found not only the music and dancing, but the story set in the jungle of a big city of young black men and a young white man struggling to survive and come up with fulfilling lives, to be a journey that is true to the lives of so many young men and women today in metropolitan cities in the USA.\n\nDuane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg have created a film in STEP UP that just hits your heart and soul with the character development created through the actors music and dance, and the sets and costumes which fit each character. I didn't want this film to end, but the last scene is just the one you wanted to see and feel. With STEP UP, you have a strong story, incredible music, wonderful young actors in a diverse world, and the hope that now their young lives can really begin.

Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex, who died between films, had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim, Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":160101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-05-07","keywords":"repeat sequel,scantily clad female,cheating death,single mother,woman in jeopardy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Destination 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi799277337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyNzRmMTktNWIxOS00ZWRiLTgyNzEtZjZmY2JiZmRiNmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyNzRmMTktNWIxOS00ZWRiLTgyNzEtZjZmY2JiZmRiNmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":160101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-05-07","keywords":"repeat sequel,scantily clad female,cheating death,single mother,woman in jeopardy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Destination 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi799277337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyNzRmMTktNWIxOS00ZWRiLTgyNzEtZjZmY2JiZmRiNmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyNzRmMTktNWIxOS00ZWRiLTgyNzEtZjZmY2JiZmRiNmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

However then I am reviewing this film based on this one solely. I thoroughly enjoyed, found the action top notch, well directed and fast paced. I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan.

I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan.

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Luther sees a Caribbean cruise poster in a Chicago travel agency window, and he begins to plan the trip. First he must see how he will pay for the trip, so he comes up with an idea that if they skipped Christmas, they could go. He will save money by not buying a tree, having a party, or putting up decorations. The neighbors think he is crazy and want him to at least put Frosty the Snowman on his roof for the local decoration contest. The battle begins between the Kranks and their neighbors.

The movie was based on a John Grisham book, 'Skipping Christmas'. It is a cute Christmas story with a lot of funny slapstick sketches.

After accidentally swapping phones, McQuarry starts getting calls from women who are part of a group of people who meet purely for casual sexual encounters. During one of these, McQuarry meets a blonde woman whom he becomes close to. When he's attacked and she disappears, he discovers more going on than he realized....\n\nFrom the above plot description some people can figure out where the story is heading. I for one did.

I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist!

Candice Renoir ima četvero djece, a nije radila deset godina kako bi pratila njezinog muža u inozemstvu. Sada rastavljena od muža, preuzima posao voditeljice istražnog tima javne sigurnosti na jugu Francuske. Na čelu ovog novog tima, ona mora dokazati da je dobra u svom poslu. Iskustvo, vještina promatranja , analitičke sposobnosti i oštroumnost pomažu joj u rješavanju istraga.</desc>

Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu.

The interpretations of Michael Sheen who plays as Lucian, Rhona Mitra who plays as Sonja and Bill Nighy who plays as Viktor were simply outstanding.\n\nFinally I have to tell you that I strongly recommend this movie such as all of the Underworld movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-02-04","keywords":"vampire,slave,werewolf,prequel,sword fight","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3494969369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MzgwNzAxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEzNTEwMg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MzgwNzAxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEzNTEwMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An origins story centered on the centuries-old feud between the the race of aristocratic vampires known as Death Dealers, and their onetime slaves, the Lycans.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593961/","name":"Rhona Mitra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790688/","name":"Michael Sheen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851281/","name":"Patrick Tatopoulos"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564286/","name":"Danny McBride","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085736/","name":"Dirk Blackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564586/","name":"Howard McCain"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The photography is stunning and the story is meant to make you think - not pander to the usual formulaic plot.

In the past few years more and more horrors have relied on jump scares to make up for the true scariest part of any horror film, the sense of dread. Dread is felt in this movie almost immediately because it combines so well with the tone, another forgotten about ingredient in horrors.\n\nThere is no real way to explain the plot of this film without it coming across like a more twisted game of "tag," which played a part in exactly how many people I could talk into seeing it after the mixed feelings from the trailer. That being said, the film breaks a lot of the norms set by today's "scary" films. This is a movie that knows what it's doing, and its main concern is to make the audience feel as if they are a part of the experience with the sense of realism. With the enemy being as far-fetched as it may come across in conversation, it's easy to get caught up in the surroundings of the characters looking for "it." Having to watch over the characters' shoulders throughout the movie makes it all the more frightening when something IS seen, and there's never a sense of safety.\n\nIt Follows takes a good deal from the greats in the horror genre, namely Halloween. I recall a great deal of times thinking "wait, that was in Halloween," where the background is scarier than what could pop up out of the shadows with some loud sound surrounding it. The score in this movie is simply unnerving and remarkable. It adds to the tone and creates an even more frightening and uncomfortable feeling when "it" has appeared. It was as if I were watching a great Carpenter movie in the theater, and it's been a great while since such a possessing and haunting score has come along. It truly is like another character in the movie, but used so well it adds to already-present uneasy feeling that one has while watching.\n\nIt Follows delivers where other recent horrors have failed, it creates memorable moments and characters which the audience feels for. Also unlike recent films, there is no way to predict what direction the movie will take, and there is finally not a completely predictable ending. Horror movies have taken easy ways out and desensitized the audience throughout by having things jump on screen which make the "big moments" feel insignificant and forgettable because audiences have been jumped at so much they just don't care anymore and they're ready to see "the monster die" (I'm oversimplifying of course, but the intent is clear). Meanwhile, this film has (quietly) some of the most memorable terrifying sequences of the decade thus far.\n\nOf course, I'd have a useless review if I didn't address the performances of It Follows. All of the other elements I've brought up in the review were almost created by, and greatly assisted by, the acting. If the acting is bad (which is a common thing in horrors), then it's hard to make anything else believable, which distances the audiences and takes away a lot of the sense of terror. The acting is so real by the cast that they make this plot seem genuine. They're not the usual teens that the audience can scream "why did they not think of.." or "I would've.." at. They address the horrifying situations as real people would, they're not magically filled with some convenient insight and they're not face-palmingly idiotic, either.\n\nIn a year filled with soon-to-be many blockbusters and money makers, It Follows will be remembered by many as one of the best of the year. It is a film that embodies all things horror, and pays great homage to what made people adore the genre. Like a good brand of medication, without the side-effects, It Follows is what the genre needed and is, to me, one of the best horror films of the decade to this point.

This film has amazed me of the right balance, timing, touch, probability, possibility, and still continues to be a wonderful piece of storytelling at my 20th viewing. The premise is most simple, bordering on a soap opera plot. A gray-area guy wakes up against the corrupt and evil surrounding he used to be all right with. He gets to the bottom of his personal and professional life, and wants to crusade against all the wicked hands that feed him. The central theme here is anguish, which I do not know any worldly and sane person not to have. It is a story of greed, money, betrayal, violence, and self-doubts. A few secrets of this film's success, as far as performances go, I believe, are the followings: 1) the likable nature of George Clooney's character 2) the absolutely non-penetrative nature of the character of Tilda Swinton 3) the wonderful madness of the character of Tom Wilkinson 4) the cold-blooded charm of the character of Sydney Pollack. These four main players are with realism and acting internalization. The director Tony Gilroy must have been a great explainer to get all the characters understand inside-out of what they are, aren't, up to, and not up to, otherwise it would have led to shallower performances. I think it is rare to find a film enable us to understand and take a strange compassion towards the so-called "bad guys" (in this case, including one very bad girl). The reason is that everyone operates in fear and instability. No one is God and no one is Satan by design. "Michael Clayton" becomes the film's title because the bucks stop here. You can follow his final departure from the Grand Ball Room to the escalator and into a taxi, whose driver is instructed to "just drive for the $50's worth", and you can judge if Michael Clayton of the world can continue to be a shock absorber for them all, being Gods or Satans. My opinion is: it is a worthily meditative ending of a worthy film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":161232,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-12-26","keywords":"business,lawyer,poker game,faking a death,audio surveillance","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Michael Clayton","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2795045145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg1YTFlMmMtNzVlZC00ZTgyLWFjNDktNmVmNjIzZjVjMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg1YTFlMmMtNzVlZC00ZTgyLWFjNDktNmVmNjIzZjVjMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

Unsure it will reach out to politicians and other non-IT people. Will probably shoot over everyone's head","reviewBody":"Saw this at the Berlinale 2016, where it was programmed as part of the official Competition section. I have to start with a full disclaimer, by confessing that information security has been my full time occupation for at least 25 years. As such it was not my intention to learn something new when viewing this documentary about the infamous Stuxnet worm, jointly developed by Israel and US, targeting Iranian reactors and obstructing the production of nuclear material. Yet I'm very interested in each and every vehicle (movie, book, newspaper article, whatever) to make non-IT people aware of the issues at hand, if only to provide material for an open debate about the pros and cons of "cyber warfare" with much wider implications than the average layman realizes.\n\nAs observed with previous movies about IT-related issues (WikiLeaks, Snowden, Steve Jobs etcetera) it is very difficult to sit it through while being (like myself) someone who worked in IT all his life. We saw numerous fragments of Assembler, flashing lights from network equipment, heavily populated cable bundles, and many screens showing various sorts of abracadabra, all supposedly intending to look technical for an average layman. Another problem is that several talking heads ducked when asked specific questions about Stuxnet, the latter being the main topic of this movie. Most of them had the usual excuse *Even when I knew about it, I cannot elaborate". Luckily, we heard not once the excuse "I can tell you about it but after that I have to shoot you", usually intended as a humorous escape from hot questions without appearing offensive or overly defiant. Several high ranking officials only wanted to speak out in general terms, thereby avoiding Stuxnet and other concrete projects, by explaining what they found wrong, especially about the secrecy that most found exaggerated and unnecessary. As such, their contributions were still useful, albeit not exactly touching the subject at hand.\n\nNevertheless, I heard a few new things I had not thought about yet. Firstly, Stuxnet was not designed to become so visible as it did. People at the NSA were furious when seeing that Israel extended v1.1 of the software to be more aggressive, making it spread and allowing it to surface, while that never had been the intention. The net result is that other countries may find justification to counter with similar software, now the US has provided for a precedent. Secondly, many people in CIA and NSA express their concerns about over-classification, preventing an open debate on future policies and rules of engagement in cyber space, like similar rules developed in the past for army, navy and air force. Cyber weapons are the fourth category, and it may take 20 to 30 years to create clear rules and policies for it. Lastly, the net effect that Stuxnet had on Iranian nuclear program, has proved to be negligible in the long run. There was a noticeable dip in the production statistics, but it triggered Iran to invest extra in centrifuges. An extra side effect was that Iran invested in cyber powers of their own, by attracting talented people on this field of expertise. As of now, it looks like they succeeded in overpowering the western world in this so-called cyber war. In other words, due to Stuxnet we lost our head start, and it is doubtful we will ever regain that.\n\nThere was one talking head with distorted voice and face, who appeared many times throughout the story. In hindsight, she was reading collected texts from several people working in NSA, CIA etcetera, all of them having useful insights on the matter but unable to come forward. Being reasonably versed in these issues, I am of the opinion that these texts sound genuine and seem to really come from people with intimate knowledge, which would otherwise be kept from the public. One example is that they internally made fun about "air gapped", the common defense against infections from the outside. They knew several ways to get over this obstacle, e.g. by infecting vendors responsible for installing and updating software in the plant, more or less working like so-called watering hole attacks. Reading these texts as done here, was an artificial but necessary addition to the documentary. In a final scene the one reading the texts revealed herself as an actress who had no personal involvement in the issues, but was effectively used as a vehicle to get this information across. During the press conference organized by the Berlinale it was explained that this was the only way to obtain and release this information, if only to protect the sources since harsh policies have been issued to deal with information leakage.\n\nAll in all, I'm not sure the message will land where it should land, namely with non-IT people who should know about the implications of "cyber warfare", having an impact on our future that cannot be underestimated. I don't think that a documentary that takes nearly 2 hours, will achieve said goal. Nevertheless, I applaud every honest attempt. The documentary is well made and tries to present a balanced view on the matter. Well made, but probably shooting over everyone's head and defeating its well-intended purposes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9478,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2016-07-08","keywords":"iran,cyber attack,computer worm,hacking,stuxnet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3677533209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"a documentary thriller about the world of cyberwar.

Unsure it will reach out to politicians and other non-IT people. Will probably shoot over everyone's head","reviewBody":"Saw this at the Berlinale 2016, where it was programmed as part of the official Competition section. I have to start with a full disclaimer, by confessing that information security has been my full time occupation for at least 25 years. As such it was not my intention to learn something new when viewing this documentary about the infamous Stuxnet worm, jointly developed by Israel and US, targeting Iranian reactors and obstructing the production of nuclear material. Yet I'm very interested in each and every vehicle (movie, book, newspaper article, whatever) to make non-IT people aware of the issues at hand, if only to provide material for an open debate about the pros and cons of "cyber warfare" with much wider implications than the average layman realizes.\n\nAs observed with previous movies about IT-related issues (WikiLeaks, Snowden, Steve Jobs etcetera) it is very difficult to sit it through while being (like myself) someone who worked in IT all his life. We saw numerous fragments of Assembler, flashing lights from network equipment, heavily populated cable bundles, and many screens showing various sorts of abracadabra, all supposedly intending to look technical for an average layman. Another problem is that several talking heads ducked when asked specific questions about Stuxnet, the latter being the main topic of this movie. Most of them had the usual excuse *Even when I knew about it, I cannot elaborate". Luckily, we heard not once the excuse "I can tell you about it but after that I have to shoot you", usually intended as a humorous escape from hot questions without appearing offensive or overly defiant. Several high ranking officials only wanted to speak out in general terms, thereby avoiding Stuxnet and other concrete projects, by explaining what they found wrong, especially about the secrecy that most found exaggerated and unnecessary. As such, their contributions were still useful, albeit not exactly touching the subject at hand.\n\nNevertheless, I heard a few new things I had not thought about yet. Firstly, Stuxnet was not designed to become so visible as it did. People at the NSA were furious when seeing that Israel extended v1.1 of the software to be more aggressive, making it spread and allowing it to surface, while that never had been the intention. The net result is that other countries may find justification to counter with similar software, now the US has provided for a precedent. Secondly, many people in CIA and NSA express their concerns about over-classification, preventing an open debate on future policies and rules of engagement in cyber space, like similar rules developed in the past for army, navy and air force. Cyber weapons are the fourth category, and it may take 20 to 30 years to create clear rules and policies for it. Lastly, the net effect that Stuxnet had on Iranian nuclear program, has proved to be negligible in the long run. There was a noticeable dip in the production statistics, but it triggered Iran to invest extra in centrifuges. An extra side effect was that Iran invested in cyber powers of their own, by attracting talented people on this field of expertise. As of now, it looks like they succeeded in overpowering the western world in this so-called cyber war. In other words, due to Stuxnet we lost our head start, and it is doubtful we will ever regain that.\n\nThere was one talking head with distorted voice and face, who appeared many times throughout the story. In hindsight, she was reading collected texts from several people working in NSA, CIA etcetera, all of them having useful insights on the matter but unable to come forward. Being reasonably versed in these issues, I am of the opinion that these texts sound genuine and seem to really come from people with intimate knowledge, which would otherwise be kept from the public. One example is that they internally made fun about "air gapped", the common defense against infections from the outside. They knew several ways to get over this obstacle, e.g. by infecting vendors responsible for installing and updating software in the plant, more or less working like so-called watering hole attacks. Reading these texts as done here, was an artificial but necessary addition to the documentary. In a final scene the one reading the texts revealed herself as an actress who had no personal involvement in the issues, but was effectively used as a vehicle to get this information across. During the press conference organized by the Berlinale it was explained that this was the only way to obtain and release this information, if only to protect the sources since harsh policies have been issued to deal with information leakage.\n\nAll in all, I'm not sure the message will land where it should land, namely with non-IT people who should know about the implications of "cyber warfare", having an impact on our future that cannot be underestimated. I don't think that a documentary that takes nearly 2 hours, will achieve said goal. Nevertheless, I applaud every honest attempt. The documentary is well made and tries to present a balanced view on the matter. Well made, but probably shooting over everyone's head and defeating its well-intended purposes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9478,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2016-07-08","keywords":"iran,cyber attack,computer worm,hacking,stuxnet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3677533209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"a documentary thriller about the world of cyberwar.

They raise the baby as their own, but soon moral challenges arise and they find themselves at an important crossroad.\n\nI'm impressed by how beautiful "The Light Between Oceans" is. The scenery is so beautiful that it makes me want to visit that place and feel its serenity. The pain of the couple and their reasons for making such a decision is well portrayed in the film, and I do feel for them for having live with the consequences of their wrongs. The story is really beautiful because it is a story of love, and paradoxically tells that sometimes the right thing to do may not be the right thing to do. It is so hard to determine what is right and what is wrong in this situation, thereby creating a conflict which keeps the film captivating. I'm deeply moved by both Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander's performances. The film haunts me after it finishes, and I'm still affected by it and ruminating about it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54945,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2016-09-02","keywords":"lighthouse,husband wife relationship,lighthouse keeper,loss of husband,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2715005977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NzQwMTY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExMDA5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NzQwMTY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExMDA5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A drama centered around a lighthouse keeper and his wife who live off the coast of Western Australia.

Unsure it will reach out to politicians and other non-IT people. Will probably shoot over everyone's head","reviewBody":"Saw this at the Berlinale 2016, where it was programmed as part of the official Competition section. I have to start with a full disclaimer, by confessing that information security has been my full time occupation for at least 25 years. As such it was not my intention to learn something new when viewing this documentary about the infamous Stuxnet worm, jointly developed by Israel and US, targeting Iranian reactors and obstructing the production of nuclear material. Yet I'm very interested in each and every vehicle (movie, book, newspaper article, whatever) to make non-IT people aware of the issues at hand, if only to provide material for an open debate about the pros and cons of "cyber warfare" with much wider implications than the average layman realizes.\n\nAs observed with previous movies about IT-related issues (WikiLeaks, Snowden, Steve Jobs etcetera) it is very difficult to sit it through while being (like myself) someone who worked in IT all his life. We saw numerous fragments of Assembler, flashing lights from network equipment, heavily populated cable bundles, and many screens showing various sorts of abracadabra, all supposedly intending to look technical for an average layman. Another problem is that several talking heads ducked when asked specific questions about Stuxnet, the latter being the main topic of this movie. Most of them had the usual excuse *Even when I knew about it, I cannot elaborate". Luckily, we heard not once the excuse "I can tell you about it but after that I have to shoot you", usually intended as a humorous escape from hot questions without appearing offensive or overly defiant. Several high ranking officials only wanted to speak out in general terms, thereby avoiding Stuxnet and other concrete projects, by explaining what they found wrong, especially about the secrecy that most found exaggerated and unnecessary. As such, their contributions were still useful, albeit not exactly touching the subject at hand.\n\nNevertheless, I heard a few new things I had not thought about yet. Firstly, Stuxnet was not designed to become so visible as it did. People at the NSA were furious when seeing that Israel extended v1.1 of the software to be more aggressive, making it spread and allowing it to surface, while that never had been the intention. The net result is that other countries may find justification to counter with similar software, now the US has provided for a precedent. Secondly, many people in CIA and NSA express their concerns about over-classification, preventing an open debate on future policies and rules of engagement in cyber space, like similar rules developed in the past for army, navy and air force. Cyber weapons are the fourth category, and it may take 20 to 30 years to create clear rules and policies for it. Lastly, the net effect that Stuxnet had on Iranian nuclear program, has proved to be negligible in the long run. There was a noticeable dip in the production statistics, but it triggered Iran to invest extra in centrifuges. An extra side effect was that Iran invested in cyber powers of their own, by attracting talented people on this field of expertise. As of now, it looks like they succeeded in overpowering the western world in this so-called cyber war. In other words, due to Stuxnet we lost our head start, and it is doubtful we will ever regain that.\n\nThere was one talking head with distorted voice and face, who appeared many times throughout the story. In hindsight, she was reading collected texts from several people working in NSA, CIA etcetera, all of them having useful insights on the matter but unable to come forward. Being reasonably versed in these issues, I am of the opinion that these texts sound genuine and seem to really come from people with intimate knowledge, which would otherwise be kept from the public. One example is that they internally made fun about "air gapped", the common defense against infections from the outside. They knew several ways to get over this obstacle, e.g. by infecting vendors responsible for installing and updating software in the plant, more or less working like so-called watering hole attacks. Reading these texts as done here, was an artificial but necessary addition to the documentary. In a final scene the one reading the texts revealed herself as an actress who had no personal involvement in the issues, but was effectively used as a vehicle to get this information across. During the press conference organized by the Berlinale it was explained that this was the only way to obtain and release this information, if only to protect the sources since harsh policies have been issued to deal with information leakage.\n\nAll in all, I'm not sure the message will land where it should land, namely with non-IT people who should know about the implications of "cyber warfare", having an impact on our future that cannot be underestimated. I don't think that a documentary that takes nearly 2 hours, will achieve said goal. Nevertheless, I applaud every honest attempt. The documentary is well made and tries to present a balanced view on the matter. Well made, but probably shooting over everyone's head and defeating its well-intended purposes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9478,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2016-07-08","keywords":"iran,cyber attack,computer worm,hacking,stuxnet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3677533209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"a documentary thriller about the world of cyberwar.

I'm sure there are many more like this one that would be great for film as an avenue for people to learn about.\n\n SYNOPSIS: During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a "hero" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.\n\nDIRECTION: Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.\n\nWRITING: The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).\n\nACTING: The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is "of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film? I mean Sam Rockwell was great in this film too, but he's another one of those "yea, but he's too good to nominate. Wouldn't be fare." Paul Walter Hauser shows so much emotion and is SO good at being a man who is holding in his anger, because he respects law enforcement too much. Then in the scenes where he breaks are just tremendous. I will be sorely disappointed if he is not nominated this year.\n\nCONCLUSION: Richard Jewell is a great story about one of American's greatest heroes who probably didn't get enough praise for the job that he did. The story itself and Paul Walter Hauser was enough for me to really enjoy this film, unfortunately there were some flaws with the story with some of the characters and some of the writing. In the end, I would definitely recommend this film for anyone to watch. Richard Jewell is the nicest man I have never met and this is just another story to show that doesn't matter how kind and genuine you are, you'll always have someone try to tear you down.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm sure there are many more like this one that would be great for film as an avenue for people to learn about.\n\n SYNOPSIS: During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a "hero" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.\n\nDIRECTION: Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.\n\nWRITING: The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).\n\nACTING: The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is "of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film? I mean Sam Rockwell was great in this film too, but he's another one of those "yea, but he's too good to nominate. Wouldn't be fare." Paul Walter Hauser shows so much emotion and is SO good at being a man who is holding in his anger, because he respects law enforcement too much. Then in the scenes where he breaks are just tremendous. I will be sorely disappointed if he is not nominated this year.\n\nCONCLUSION: Richard Jewell is a great story about one of American's greatest heroes who probably didn't get enough praise for the job that he did. The story itself and Paul Walter Hauser was enough for me to really enjoy this film, unfortunately there were some flaws with the story with some of the characters and some of the writing. In the end, I would definitely recommend this film for anyone to watch. Richard Jewell is the nicest man I have never met and this is just another story to show that doesn't matter how kind and genuine you are, you'll always have someone try to tear you down.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The superbly dramatic theme music, followed immediately by Richard Burton's striking Welsh narration, are utterly entrancing. The rest of the film is not bad, either!\n\nIn January 1879, during the Boer War, at Isandhlwana in South Africa, over one thousand British troops are annihilated by King Cetshwayo's Zulu army. Standing between the four thousand Zulus and victory is the mission station at Rorke's Drift and about one hundred and forty British soldiers, some of whom are wounded. Commanding the military operation is the young Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker, also co-producer of the film) with Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine, in his first major film role). Against the unimaginable odds, the British troops - the B Company of the 24th Regiment of Foot, South Wales Borderers - manage, with exceptional courage and stoicism, to hold off the Zulu attacks until morning. The valour of the men defending Rourke's Drift resulted in the awarding of eleven Victoria Crosses. The roll of honour is recited by Richard Burton at the film's end.\n\nBaker and Caine are very convincing in the two lead roles as Chard and Bromhead, the rival lieutenants from different social classes who come to respect and even like each other. Their first meeting emphasises the psychological as well as the physical distance between them. Chard, the Engineer Officer, in his shirt-sleeves, is up to his waist in water; Bromhead, the upper-class blue-blood, in his helmet and fine cloak, is on horseback, having just returned from hunting. However, as the battle progresses, this rivalry is forgotten as their prime concern is the job in hand. Their exchange when Chard is injured and Bromhead goes to his aid is telling. By the end of the film, as they stand together in the burnt-out ruins of the hospital, they are equals.\n\nThe incredibly virile Stanley Baker (one wants to say, "Fwhoar!" every time he appears on screen) co-produced the film because, like most Welshmen, he was extremely patriotic and wanted to publicise the bravery of the Welsh soldiers at Rorke's Drift. Michael Caine auditioned originally for the part of Hook but was offered instead the part of Bromhead as his looks were considered more suited to those of an upper-class officer than a Cockney private.\n\nGood support is given by the other actors in the supporting roles. James Booth as Private Henry Hook is probably the most memorable character, portrayed (historically inaccurately) as the company ne'er-do-well, yet who wakes up to his duty at the moment of crisis and fights almost to the death. Jack Hawkins and Ulla Jacobssen are effective as the well-meaning but naive father-and-daughter missionaries, the Witts. The outstanding bravery and selflessness of the other (mainly) Welsh soldiers is brought out by all the actors in the subordinate roles. \n\nWhat I think is very admirable about 'Zulu' is its lack of jingoism. Far from it crowing about British supremacy over the natives, it portrays the bravery of the Zulus as equal to or even greater than that of the British. At the end of the battle, there is no great rejoicing; it was just a job which had to be done because they were there. In the ruins of the hospital, when Chard asks Bromhead how he feels, Bromhead replies, "Sick." Their dialogue continues: \n\nBromhead: There's something else. I feel ashamed. Was that how it was for you? The first time?\n\nChard: First time? Do you think I could stand this butcher's yard more than once?\n\nBromhead: I didn't know. \n\nChard: I told you. I came up here to build a bridge.\n\nNo more needs to be said.\n\nAlthough the character names and events are factual, the film does sometimes sacrifice historical accuracy for dramatic effect. How much real rivalry there was between Chard and Bromhead is unclear - although it is true that Bromhead ceded command to Chard. Private Hook was not the thief and ne'er-do-well as played by James Booth. Colour Sergeant Bourne was a short man and quite unlike Nigel Green in appearance. Most of the Victoria Cross winners were English, not Welsh. And the film itself was shot not at Rorke's Drift but at a location some miles away.\n\nInterestingly, neither Chard nor Bromhead lived to a great age. Both died in their forties, Chard of mouth cancer in 1897 and Bromhead of fever on active service a few years before. Neither ever married. Nevertheless, their names are immortalised in 'Zulu' - as are the deeds of the tremendously brave men, Welsh, English and Zulu, at Rorke's Drift on 22nd/23rd January 1879.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The superbly dramatic theme music, followed immediately by Richard Burton's striking Welsh narration, are utterly entrancing. The rest of the film is not bad, either!\n\nIn January 1879, during the Boer War, at Isandhlwana in South Africa, over one thousand British troops are annihilated by King Cetshwayo's Zulu army. Standing between the four thousand Zulus and victory is the mission station at Rorke's Drift and about one hundred and forty British soldiers, some of whom are wounded. Commanding the military operation is the young Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker, also co-producer of the film) with Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine, in his first major film role). Against the unimaginable odds, the British troops - the B Company of the 24th Regiment of Foot, South Wales Borderers - manage, with exceptional courage and stoicism, to hold off the Zulu attacks until morning. The valour of the men defending Rourke's Drift resulted in the awarding of eleven Victoria Crosses. The roll of honour is recited by Richard Burton at the film's end.\n\nBaker and Caine are very convincing in the two lead roles as Chard and Bromhead, the rival lieutenants from different social classes who come to respect and even like each other. Their first meeting emphasises the psychological as well as the physical distance between them. Chard, the Engineer Officer, in his shirt-sleeves, is up to his waist in water; Bromhead, the upper-class blue-blood, in his helmet and fine cloak, is on horseback, having just returned from hunting. However, as the battle progresses, this rivalry is forgotten as their prime concern is the job in hand. Their exchange when Chard is injured and Bromhead goes to his aid is telling. By the end of the film, as they stand together in the burnt-out ruins of the hospital, they are equals.\n\nThe incredibly virile Stanley Baker (one wants to say, "Fwhoar!" every time he appears on screen) co-produced the film because, like most Welshmen, he was extremely patriotic and wanted to publicise the bravery of the Welsh soldiers at Rorke's Drift. Michael Caine auditioned originally for the part of Hook but was offered instead the part of Bromhead as his looks were considered more suited to those of an upper-class officer than a Cockney private.\n\nGood support is given by the other actors in the supporting roles. James Booth as Private Henry Hook is probably the most memorable character, portrayed (historically inaccurately) as the company ne'er-do-well, yet who wakes up to his duty at the moment of crisis and fights almost to the death. Jack Hawkins and Ulla Jacobssen are effective as the well-meaning but naive father-and-daughter missionaries, the Witts. The outstanding bravery and selflessness of the other (mainly) Welsh soldiers is brought out by all the actors in the subordinate roles. \n\nWhat I think is very admirable about 'Zulu' is its lack of jingoism. Far from it crowing about British supremacy over the natives, it portrays the bravery of the Zulus as equal to or even greater than that of the British. At the end of the battle, there is no great rejoicing; it was just a job which had to be done because they were there. In the ruins of the hospital, when Chard asks Bromhead how he feels, Bromhead replies, "Sick." Their dialogue continues: \n\nBromhead: There's something else. I feel ashamed. Was that how it was for you? The first time?\n\nChard: First time? Do you think I could stand this butcher's yard more than once?\n\nBromhead: I didn't know. \n\nChard: I told you. I came up here to build a bridge.\n\nNo more needs to be said.\n\nAlthough the character names and events are factual, the film does sometimes sacrifice historical accuracy for dramatic effect. How much real rivalry there was between Chard and Bromhead is unclear - although it is true that Bromhead ceded command to Chard. Private Hook was not the thief and ne'er-do-well as played by James Booth. Colour Sergeant Bourne was a short man and quite unlike Nigel Green in appearance. Most of the Victoria Cross winners were English, not Welsh. And the film itself was shot not at Rorke's Drift but at a location some miles away.\n\nInterestingly, neither Chard nor Bromhead lived to a great age. Both died in their forties, Chard of mouth cancer in 1897 and Bromhead of fever on active service a few years before. Neither ever married. Nevertheless, their names are immortalised in 'Zulu' - as are the deeds of the tremendously brave men, Welsh, English and Zulu, at Rorke's Drift on 22nd/23rd January 1879.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":300792,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Stepan refuses, but Anna finds a card of a restaurant owned by the Russian Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) inside the diary and she visits the old man trying to find a lead to contact Tatiana's family. When she mentions the existence of the diary, Semyon immediately offers to translate the document. However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) had raped Tatiana when she was fourteen years old and forced her to work as prostitute in a brothel of their own. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia "Vory v Zakone", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family.

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":300792,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":300792,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"duration":"PT2H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A battle of the sexes comedy that has sex appeal but no romance, Intolerable Cruelty is a film that reaches for the golden age of Hollywood but only touches the bronze.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-12-24","keywords":"woman wears eyeglasses,strong female character,lake tahoe,reference to henry viii,deception","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Intolerable Cruelty","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi781320473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000671/","name":"Billy Bob Thornton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0709070/","name":"Robert Ramsey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0832043/","name":"Matthew Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738908/","name":"John Romano"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Masterful storytelling when combined with expert filmmaking is a treasure to be appreciated and enjoyed, even if the story is not so pleasant. Such is the case with this gem from writer-director Karim Ainouz, who adapted the screenplay with Murilo Hauser and Ines Bortagaray from the novel "The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao" by Martha Bathala. Based in Rio de Janiero, the film blends the vibrant colors of the area with the traditional and restrictive Latin American family expectations of the 1950's.\n\nThe story spans 5 or 6 decades, and when we first meet sisters Euridice and Guida, it's clear they share a tight emotional bond that goes deeper than blood. Though their personalities differ greatly, they are both ahead of their time and out of step with the conventions of the era. Euridice (a strong performance by Carol Duarte) longs for independence and aspires to be a concert pianist after a hoped-for Conservatory in Vienna, while Guida (a powerhouse Julia Stockler) is a dreamer seeking true love, and whose party girl ways must be kept hidden from their conservative father. Both young ladies are spirited, yet respectful.\n\nTheir lives are forever altered when Guida runs off to Greece with her sailor lover. As is too often the case with young dreamers, she returns home once her spontaneous choices prove to be poor judgment. Her father rejects his pregnant daughter since, in his eyes, she has disgraced the family. The parents mislead Guida about her sister's whereabouts, so Guida assumes Euridice is off at conservatory fulfilling her dreams. This sets Guida off on her own solitary path.\n\nIn actuality, Euridice has married and experienced one of the worst ever wedding nights, featuring what is likely cinema's most unsexy bathroom lovemaking scene. There is an element of horror films to this segment of the film, as the sisters are living their worst nightmares, while being separated from each other ... unable to communicate. The male-dominated Latin culture and family traditions prevent their mother from 'disobeying' the father's order, so the cruel lie continues as the sisters unknowingly live their lives within the same town. There is even one excruciatingly painful-to-watch scene that finds them in the same restaurant at the same time, yet oblivious to the presence of the other.\n\nEach woman's inner-strength pushes them forward. Guida (now Gisele) befriends a wise former prostitute Filomena (an excellent Barbara Santos) who becomes her mentor in poverty. Euridice tries to make the best of her situation while keeping her dream alive. Mostly what we have is a tragic story without one specific tragedy - other than the daughter spurned by her father. There are so many moments of pain and frustration, with undelivered mail being among the worst. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Helene Louvart, and it reminds us that 'life happens', and it's not all love and Bach. This is an emotional and heart-breaking story, and devotees of The Lifetime Channel will likely be disappointed in the ending. For me, I have no qualms about the emotional wringer the film puts viewers through - even after the opening scene foreshadowing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7456,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-21","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,erection,male explicit nudity,erect penis,uncircumcised penis","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3375480601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNhMDI1ZTYtNzU2Ny00NGIzLTlmN2MtYjg4OGY0MjUxNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNhMDI1ZTYtNzU2Ny00NGIzLTlmN2MtYjg4OGY0MjUxNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rio de Janeiro, 1950.

Masterful storytelling when combined with expert filmmaking is a treasure to be appreciated and enjoyed, even if the story is not so pleasant. Such is the case with this gem from writer-director Karim Ainouz, who adapted the screenplay with Murilo Hauser and Ines Bortagaray from the novel "The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao" by Martha Bathala. Based in Rio de Janiero, the film blends the vibrant colors of the area with the traditional and restrictive Latin American family expectations of the 1950's.\n\nThe story spans 5 or 6 decades, and when we first meet sisters Euridice and Guida, it's clear they share a tight emotional bond that goes deeper than blood. Though their personalities differ greatly, they are both ahead of their time and out of step with the conventions of the era. Euridice (a strong performance by Carol Duarte) longs for independence and aspires to be a concert pianist after a hoped-for Conservatory in Vienna, while Guida (a powerhouse Julia Stockler) is a dreamer seeking true love, and whose party girl ways must be kept hidden from their conservative father. Both young ladies are spirited, yet respectful.\n\nTheir lives are forever altered when Guida runs off to Greece with her sailor lover. As is too often the case with young dreamers, she returns home once her spontaneous choices prove to be poor judgment. Her father rejects his pregnant daughter since, in his eyes, she has disgraced the family. The parents mislead Guida about her sister's whereabouts, so Guida assumes Euridice is off at conservatory fulfilling her dreams. This sets Guida off on her own solitary path.\n\nIn actuality, Euridice has married and experienced one of the worst ever wedding nights, featuring what is likely cinema's most unsexy bathroom lovemaking scene. There is an element of horror films to this segment of the film, as the sisters are living their worst nightmares, while being separated from each other ... unable to communicate. The male-dominated Latin culture and family traditions prevent their mother from 'disobeying' the father's order, so the cruel lie continues as the sisters unknowingly live their lives within the same town. There is even one excruciatingly painful-to-watch scene that finds them in the same restaurant at the same time, yet oblivious to the presence of the other.\n\nEach woman's inner-strength pushes them forward. Guida (now Gisele) befriends a wise former prostitute Filomena (an excellent Barbara Santos) who becomes her mentor in poverty. Euridice tries to make the best of her situation while keeping her dream alive. Mostly what we have is a tragic story without one specific tragedy - other than the daughter spurned by her father. There are so many moments of pain and frustration, with undelivered mail being among the worst. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Helene Louvart, and it reminds us that 'life happens', and it's not all love and Bach. This is an emotional and heart-breaking story, and devotees of The Lifetime Channel will likely be disappointed in the ending. For me, I have no qualms about the emotional wringer the film puts viewers through - even after the opening scene foreshadowing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7456,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-21","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,erection,male explicit nudity,erect penis,uncircumcised penis","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3375480601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNhMDI1ZTYtNzU2Ny00NGIzLTlmN2MtYjg4OGY0MjUxNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNhMDI1ZTYtNzU2Ny00NGIzLTlmN2MtYjg4OGY0MjUxNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rio de Janeiro, 1950.

Then just like any action, the producers decided to throw more money at the same people hoping for the same result. Usually all this leads to is everything being the same but with more explosions and a bigger pay-check to get the same people back..

This is one of the many self aware jokes that the film keeps throwing at us. Usually staying fixed on joking that it's a sequel would get repetitive after a while, but the film just keeps handling it in different ways to keep the laughs coming. \n\nIt works because of the clever writing which parodies every detail of an action sequel, keeping the jokes fresh and original. They'll make a joke out of everything from the fact that things getting destroyed in car chases costs a lot in the budget to even John Woo's doves being randomly thrown in. At times some of the jokes don't work quite as well, but there's enough hilarious moments packed in to make sure the laughs keep coming and mocks every possible detail of the action sequel. \n\nOn top of this, the actors know how to make the jokes work with all the actors having the same charm as last time. Ice Cube gets his angry boss role down to the note, mastering the angry stare and yelling almost every line of dialogue he gets. The cameos from the villains be as over the top as you can get. And just like before, both Hill and Tatum bring their A game in their ultimate bromance together. It was one of the key elements of the first film and the actors chemistry remains just as funny and enjoyable here.

Ovoga puta njihova misija ih vodi na fakultet gdje će pokušati stati na kraj tajanstvenom narko bossu.Nakon što su prošli kroz srednju školu (dvaput), policajce Schmidta i Jenka očekuju velike stvari nakon što preuzmu tajni zadatak i nađu se na lokalnom fakultetu. Ali nakon što Jenko upozna svoju srodnu dušu u atletskom timu, a Schimdta preokupiraju predavanja boemske umjetnosti, obojica započinju ozbiljno preispitivati svoje partnerstvo.Ubrzo se njih dvojica neće samo susresti s problemom rješavanja slučaja zbog kojeg su uopće došli na fakultet – već će morati otkriti posjeduju li volju i želju da stupe u prijateljski odnos kakav imaju stariji, ozbiljni ljudi. Ako uspiju nadvladati adolescenciju i iz mladića postanu muškarci, odlazak na fakultet bi mogla biti najbolja stvar koja im se ikada dogodila.</desc>

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence. Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show.

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence. Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show. I do hope that there are quite a few new series planned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence. Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show. I do hope that there are quite a few new series planned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Provenza, who you probably wouldn't mind punching in the face ... then episodes later, he's one of your favorite characters on the show. The characters is what makes this show good, and the crimes only further bring out their own .. uh .. character. The script dialog is also very witty.

Sidney vodi miran život, ili ga je barem vodio - sve dok nije naišao na ubojstvo. Godina je 1953. Sidney Chambers (James Norton) je vikar u Grantchesteru, selu nedaleko od Cambridgea. Sidney vodi miran život, ili ga je barem vodio - sve dok nije naišao na ubojstvo... Zatekavši se u opasnom svijetu laži, izdaje i umorstva, Sidney ubrzo shvaća da mu poznavanje ljudske psihe te povjerenje koje ljudima ulijeva omogućavaju da iznimno vješto obavlja svoj novi ''detektivski'' posao. Sidneyju se u toj mračnoj strani svijeta pridružuju ljubazan, ali od života umoran inspektor Geordie Keating (Robson Green), naivni i dobrohotni kapelan Leonard Finch (Al Weaver) te njegova stroga i vječno nezadovoljna domaćica gđa Maguire (Tessa Peake-Jones). Međutim, kriminal nije jedino što Sidneyju zadaje brige. Sidney je zanesen lijepom i pametnom Amandom (Morven Christie), ali izgubio je svaku nadu da će ikada osvojiti njezino srce onoga trenutka kada je postao svećenikom. Možete li i dalje vidjeti samo najbolje u ljudima kada svijet umorstava od čovjeka traži da u njima vidi samo najgore?</desc>

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

Fox has always canceled good shows. Look at their track record Dark Angel, Terminator The Sarah Conner Chronicles Family Guy (yes they brought it back but they were still stupid enough to cancel it) Firefly, Dollhouse, Lucifer (than Satan himself for Netflix righting that Wrong) Gifted &amp; Brooklyn Nine Nine. I'm sure there are more but those are the ones that I felt were canceled to soon. Fox never knows what to do with shows that...well if I'm honest any show. The people they pick to run the network are great at green lighting shows that don't fit the status quo of primetime but they never have the know how to promote it or the courage to wait and for those shows to click with fans &amp; critics. They also foolishly play fast and loose with time slots and preempt their new shows for sports with such regularity that it's no wonder when a shows 3 episode's ratings dropped from episode 1 &amp; 2 when the episode if you're lucky aired at midnight and you're DVR caught it but more than likely it didn't air and go figure people didn't watch the 3rd episode when episode 2 aired 6 weeks earlier. Out of sight out of mind. Or in Next's case episode 3 didn't even air on the network but on Hulu. Yet they wonder why viewership isn't what they want. Now has Fox been run by well anyone with a brain they would've aired the episodes during the time when everyone was stuck at home struggling to find something of quality to watch but then that would involve Fox actually having someone who actually knew anything about well anything.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"san francisco california,disney,20th television,die hard scenario","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805476/","name":"John Slattery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1223326/","name":"Fernanda Andrade"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1134612/","name":"Michael Mosley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078110/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330850/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0738806/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0182873/","name":"Manny Coto"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi712752665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJkOTNmYzQtZTQ4OC00NmRhLWI0ZWMtYmUxZDAxZjIwZmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJkOTNmYzQtZTQ4OC00NmRhLWI0ZWMtYmUxZDAxZjIwZmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"When a Silicon Valley pioneer discovers that one of his own creations --  a powerful A.I. -- might spell global catastrophe, he teams up with a cybercrime agent to fight a villain unlike anything we've ever seen:  one whose greatest weapon against us is ourselves."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Fox has always canceled good shows. Look at their track record Dark Angel, Terminator The Sarah Conner Chronicles Family Guy (yes they brought it back but they were still stupid enough to cancel it) Firefly, Dollhouse, Lucifer (than Satan himself for Netflix righting that Wrong) Gifted &amp; Brooklyn Nine Nine. I'm sure there are more but those are the ones that I felt were canceled to soon. Fox never knows what to do with shows that...well if I'm honest any show. The people they pick to run the network are great at green lighting shows that don't fit the status quo of primetime but they never have the know how to promote it or the courage to wait and for those shows to click with fans &amp; critics. They also foolishly play fast and loose with time slots and preempt their new shows for sports with such regularity that it's no wonder when a shows 3 episode's ratings dropped from episode 1 &amp; 2 when the episode if you're lucky aired at midnight and you're DVR caught it but more than likely it didn't air and go figure people didn't watch the 3rd episode when episode 2 aired 6 weeks earlier. Out of sight out of mind. Or in Next's case episode 3 didn't even air on the network but on Hulu. Yet they wonder why viewership isn't what they want. Now has Fox been run by well anyone with a brain they would've aired the episodes during the time when everyone was stuck at home struggling to find something of quality to watch but then that would involve Fox actually having someone who actually knew anything about well anything.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"san francisco california,disney,20th television,die hard scenario","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0805476/","name":"John Slattery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1223326/","name":"Fernanda Andrade","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1134612/","name":"Michael Mosley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078110/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330850/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0738806/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0182873/","name":"Manny Coto"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi712752665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJkOTNmYzQtZTQ4OC00NmRhLWI0ZWMtYmUxZDAxZjIwZmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJkOTNmYzQtZTQ4OC00NmRhLWI0ZWMtYmUxZDAxZjIwZmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"When a Silicon Valley pioneer discovers that one of his own creations --  a powerful A.I. -- might spell global catastrophe, he teams up with a cybercrime agent to fight a villain unlike anything we've ever seen:  one whose greatest weapon against us is ourselves."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot . This is all well and good but illustrates the fact highly regarded novels often don't lend themselves to great cinema . Let's not forget two of the most memorable movies of the 1970s THE GODFATHER and JAWS were based on novels dismissed as trash","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195164,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"spy,cold war,mole,double agent,woman on top","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Domestic Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3394673689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6's echelons."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019247/","name":"Tomas Alfredson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0350317/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035433/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494170/","name":"John le Carré"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2091799/","name":"Bridget O'Connor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot . This is all well and good but illustrates the fact highly regarded novels often don't lend themselves to great cinema . Let's not forget two of the most memorable movies of the 1970s THE GODFATHER and JAWS were based on novels dismissed as trash","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195164,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"spy,cold war,mole,double agent,woman on top","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Domestic Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3394673689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6's echelons.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019247/","name":"Tomas Alfredson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0350317/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035433/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494170/","name":"John le Carré","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2091799/","name":"Bridget O'Connor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

WOW. I can't stop watching it - this is an addictive show, no doubt.\n\nI love the cast - each girl plays her character so very well. (HANNA IS MY FAVE) All are believable. And, geez the plot twists keep you on your toes, don't they???!!!! The boys are good, too...and the moms. A great deal of chemistry between the actors and actresses- which helps this series work at a very high level.\n\nLots of drama that you care about- lots of love, attraction, heartbreak, confusion, gossip, and a crime or two here and there!\n\nBeginning of the 2nd Season and I just found out something I literally could NOT believe. (I won't tell you- you should go find out).\n\nSo glad I found this show- just finished watching BREAKING BAD..and, although I thoght that was a great show, too...it was so dark, ttis one is generally not "dark," but it does have some seriously heavy plot lines....it's no lightwsight, belive e.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158964,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-06-08","keywords":"neo noir,murder,stalker,torture,kidnapping","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069079/","name":"Troian Bellisario","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1667364/","name":"Ashley Benson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1423955/","name":"Lucy Hale"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050794/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142434/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183230/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454783/","name":"I.

A night out prior to the offer seals the LA based Dylan to relocate and take up the offer, with plenty of activities thrown in that if it's not Jamie being his only friend in a new, big city, they would serve as activities that would fit in for an awesome date night out.

Deny all you want, but one cannot help but to agree that the fairer sex will have things rough if pacts of this nature turn sour, and expectedly in a movie they always do, otherwise everyone will be happy without adversary, frustration and challenges to overcome and provide that change in strength of character.\n\nAnd it is this power of the cliché that absolutely calls the shots in films like these. You know what will happen, but want to see them happen anyway even though you're multiple steps ahead of every character. And it is precisely these expectations that anyone would want to see covered, and try as the filmmakers want it is the clichés that they find hard to break away from, even if characters here proclaim very early on that romance in their world shouldn't be like an unbelievable Hollywood film, but in what would be art imitating art, look who's talking to begin with.

He has that boyish charm that the camera just loves, and being a real life singer meant covering a number of songs here, from Stereophonics to Kris Kross made it look all too easy. Mila Kunis plays her role as the emotionally damaged girl with aplomb, and shares an effective chemistry with Timberlake that makes this film a delight to sit through, even if as mentioned the story's cliché and we know just about how these two nice looking people will likely get together. \n\nThe supporting characters while one dimensional almost always threaten to steal the show, from Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's sex crazed mom extending the lifespan of a running joke involving the nationality of Jamie's unseen dad, Woody Harrelson as the gay colleague of Dylan who always have innuendos offhand to share, Jenna Elfman who plays Dylan's sister and Richard Jenkins starring as Dylan's dad who's suffering from advancing Alzheimer's disease, which is especially poignant as it deals with the subplot of how a family copes with a loved one who's behaviour develops erratically, and holding the key to a pivotal personal experience to share and turn things around.\n\nWith Andy Samberg and Emma Stone making cameos (the latter being extremely crazy as a fanatical John Meyer fan), Friends With Benefits has its main leads to thank for in milking quite the cliché story for the masses, who are likely to make a beeline just to see those two in some down and dirty action, not that you get to see a lot to begin with anyway.

It is a great movie, executed brilliantly and it deserves the praise it gets.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356752,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-08-12","keywords":"spy,rogue agent,computer hacker,mission,capture","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3396513817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTM2NDU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwNTUwNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTM2NDU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwNTUwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272581/","name":"Rebecca Ferguson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719637/","name":"Jeremy Renner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021593/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312367/","name":"Bruce Geller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1510800/","name":"Drew Pearce"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However then I am reviewing this film based on this one solely. I thoroughly enjoyed, found the action top notch, well directed and fast paced. I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan. Kate Beckinsale is great as Selene as well as the other supporting actors.

However then I am reviewing this film based on this one solely. I thoroughly enjoyed, found the action top notch, well directed and fast paced. I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan. Kate Beckinsale is great as Selene as well as the other supporting actors. The Lycans and vampires were an interesting take in this, as well as the final scene involving Selene having to fight the giant Lycan. The 3D was believable and so were the gimmicks.

As it turns out, the actual story, according to the bonus features on the DVD was even more melodramatic than the film's.

All in all I found it an enjoyable and enlightening story - the triumph of a unique individual whose determination, empathy, and sense of moral duty ultimately outweigh her abrasiveness and lack of social graces. And largely why she triumphs is her partnership with an intelligent and decent lawyer in Ed Masry. What a refreshing departure from the usual Hollywood stereotype! On many occasions, he effectively counters Erin's prejudices with rational explanations how and why the legal system works the way it does, and why lawyers behave the way they do. With her passion and his reason, they make a great team.

I do have Out Of Sight on my to see list coming up soon and I do need to give Traffic another watch before I make any final assessment on him. Although Soderbergh is frequently the director, cinematography and editor on his projects, he may be efficient but he's far too clinical, pushing the audience as an observer that it's difficult to feel emotionally involved in his films. I can't get excited for his half-baked premises that most likely haven't been fulfilled to their potential. However, Behind The Candelabra may be the first film I've seen of his that suits his style ideally. His style is still distant and voyeuristic, but in this bizarre world where Liberace adopts his lover for a son and pays for plastic surgery to make him look like himself, it feels more deliberate to keep us at a distance.\n\nInstead, the scenes of dramatic conflict, decision and choice are played off for jokes and it's really effective, always earning belly laughs with its brilliant one-liners without feeling like it's silly. Perhaps its nervous laughter but it makes for an entertaining and interesting film. Michael Douglas is terrific as Liberace. I've never seen him take a character on like this. He's nearly up there with Sean Penn's Milk. It feels like it's been a while since Matt Damon has been in films I've wanted to watch and with this and Elysium, I've forgotten how reliable a lead he is. The characters inhabit a flashy world, but its kept on the costumes and sets which are incidental more than anything and the style of the film is kept subtle, besides a great choice of swooping cameras. It does have its flaws with nearly soap opera-esque structure and conflict but my expectations were very low so this is a pleasant surprise.

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story.

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story. I for the most part was disappointed, it could have been so much better, all the had to do was pay attention to the source material, and not just scan over it. Also the re-writing of many of the characters is inconceivable to me, no idea why they would do it. \n\nMeh...

It's a bit flat but perfectly enjoyable for younger kids. Making the Once-ler human, though? BRILLIANT. Hear me out. The original Once-ler was a faceless force of destruction, a shadowy embodiment of greed. This Once-ler is just a stupid kid with a dream, a guy who wants to change the world.

Companies don't sit around all day cackling about how much smog they're pumping into the atmosphere; it's a process, and something that happened gradually. Obliviousness is just as dangerous as maliciousness, and that's a really powerful lesson. This can happen to YOU if you're not careful; anybody can hurt the planet if they don't pay attention.

There's nothing offensive about it (besides the miserable marketing) and my little brother enjoyed it as a fun movie. I enjoyed it for giving us a deeper--and in my opinion, very powerful--character type: the accidental villain, the everydude who makes a horrible mistake that the environment suffers for.

Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.\n\nDeadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.\n\nFrom the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":958120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-02-17","keywords":"breaking the fourth wall,anti hero,sex scene,mercenary,revenge","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Even-More-Voiced-Over Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi567457049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A groundbreaking 4th wall breaking trailer breakdown of a character who breaks the 4th wall, including extra voice-over on a trailer that includes a voice-over. 8 walls + 4 breaks + 2 voice overs = 1 game-changing superhero."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072555/","name":"Morena Baccarin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2554352/","name":"T.J.

This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater. It's no wonder other countries believe Americans lack respect for everyone and everything. Hollywood apparently does and wants everyone to know it. Unfortunately, the general public is judged by Hollywood--the American delivery system. It's not worth the money to see it.

I love to watch a good chic-flick. However, I was so disappointed. This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater. It's no wonder other countries believe Americans lack respect for everyone and everything. Hollywood apparently does and wants everyone to know it. Unfortunately, the general public is judged by Hollywood--the American delivery system. It's not worth the money to see it. If you can get it on DVD for a buck, then judge for yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":76903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-06-02","keywords":"sexually empowered woman,promiscuous woman,sex comedy,kissing a married woman,sex in bed","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi196609817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4NjUzMzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5NTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4NjUzMzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5NTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sex and the City -- Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455078/","name":"Michael Patrick King"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455078/","name":"Michael Patrick King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124299/","name":"Candace Bushnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"],"duration":"PT2H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I recommend watching in German with the English sub-titles, the language is so cool too and of course the music is some really cool German hip hop.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-08","keywords":"business,female front nudity,strippers,adult movie theater,unprotected sex","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1391248/","name":"Kida Khodr Ramadan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7194136/","name":"Veysel Gelin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3137668/","name":"Almila Bagriacik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312451/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352514/","name":"Hanno Hackfort","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1293138/","name":"Bob Konrad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472277/","name":"Richard Kropf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Staffel 3 [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761132313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Od kreatorice / scenaristice / zvijezde Isse Rae, serija "Nesigurna" bavi se nerazdvojnom grupom prijateljica, milenijalki i crnkinja koje navigiraju neugodnim i formativnim iskustvima u srcu L. A.-a. Iako je sputava Molly, dugogodišnja najbolja prijateljica i korporativna odvjetnica koja se sjajno snalazi pred raznim odborima, ali ne i s osjećajima, Issa je strastvena graditeljica zajednice iz Inglewooda čija neodlučnost često omete njezinu viziju. Radnja se nastavlja nedugo nakon što su obje prijateljice dobile nogu od svojih partnera. Peta i posljednja sezona prati naše glavne junakinje, uz smiješnu Kelli i zahtjevnu Tiffany, kako pokušavaju stati na noge i nastaviti sa životom.</desc>

The gangster theme is pretty cool and as a Muslim it's also interesting to hear Asalamalaikum and Alhamdulillah so many times in a show about gangsters. Anyway, great show, super gritty and tough but very entertaining.

The characters are flawed, but honest. I live in the states, so I don't know how realistic this show is, but it really takes you into these neighborhoods in Germany and gives you a feel of what life is like there. The gangster theme is pretty cool and as a Muslim it's also interesting to hear Asalamalaikum and Alhamdulillah so many times in a show about gangsters. Anyway, great show, super gritty and tough but very entertaining. I recommend watching in German with the English sub-titles, the language is so cool too and of course the music is some really cool German hip hop.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-08","keywords":"business,female front nudity,strippers,adult movie theater,unprotected sex","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1391248/","name":"Kida Khodr Ramadan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7194136/","name":"Veysel Gelin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3137668/","name":"Almila Bagriacik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312451/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352514/","name":"Hanno Hackfort","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1293138/","name":"Bob Konrad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472277/","name":"Richard Kropf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Staffel 3 [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761132313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze. In a part equally poorly written, she made far more of her scenes than the writers gave her. \n\nThe most interesting character in the film was certainly Rick Yune, as Graves' 'enforcer', Zao. Charismatic, ruthless, and nearly unstoppable, Zao was nearly a primal force, far more menacing than Graves at his worst.\n\nWhile a sword-fight sequence between Bond and Graves provided a rare film highlight, and certainly ranks as one of the film series' more memorable sequences, much of the rest of the production was silly, with the story set at a break-neck pace to 'hide' the absurdities. The climax, as a solar 'ray' destroyed the minefield between North and South Korea, allowing an 'invasion' to occur, as 007 and Jinx attempted to commandeer the aircraft controlling the 'ray', stands as one of the most ludicrous finales to a Bond film since MOONRAKER.\n\nAlthough DIE ANOTHER DAY would become Pierce Brosnan's highest-grossing Bond, to date, the film, despite heavily promoting Halle Berry's presence, failed to crack the 'Top Ten' box office attractions in the U.S., and disappointed many fans, worldwide.\n\nWith the purchase of MGM by Sony, which has wanted to produce a Bond film for years (the studios were entangled in a legal suit that ended just as DIE began production), surprising changes were in store...CASINO ROYALE, the only Fleming title NOT owned by Eon Productions was named as the next 007 adventure...and Pierce Brosnan was FIRED (a sad finish for an actor who'd worked so hard to make 007 viable in the new millennium!)

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box.

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box. I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

HBO donosi premijeru treće sezone za "Emmy" nominirane humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. Dok prati vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), serija duhovito kritizira svakodnevnu uredsku politiku drugog najvažnijeg ureda u zemlji. Nakon otkrića na kraju druge sezone da se predsjednik neće kandidirati za nove izbore, treća sezona počinje tako što Selina, željna promaknuća, vrbuje stranačke aktiviste Iowe na potpisivanju svoje nove knjige "Neki novi počeci". Uskoro se Selina i njezino osoblje vraćaju u Washington za Mikeovo vjenčanje i saznaju da je ministar obrane Maddox dao ostavku.</desc>

The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it. \n\nIt did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.\n\n"When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), "I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'...."The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely," he said. "But look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner."\n\n"The old postscript sent the message that, for political reasons, Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them."(Sept/Oct., 2012, thestar.com)".\n\nSo the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there. \n\nSince the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.\n\nI can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does, even after the changed postscripts.\n\nStill, a really entertaining and riveting film, very well done, and easily worth seeing. As a matter of fact, don't miss it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"iran,hostage,u.s. embassy,escape,american embassy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537319449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.

The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it. \n\nIt did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.\n\n"When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), "I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'...."The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely," he said. "But look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner."\n\n"The old postscript sent the message that, for political reasons, Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them."(Sept/Oct., 2012, thestar.com)".\n\nSo the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there. \n\nSince the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.\n\nI can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does, even after the changed postscripts.\n\nStill, a really entertaining and riveting film, very well done, and easily worth seeing. As a matter of fact, don't miss it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"iran,hostage,u.s. embassy,escape,american embassy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537319449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

HBO donosi premijeru treće sezone za "Emmy" nominirane humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. Dok prati vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), serija duhovito kritizira svakodnevnu uredsku politiku drugog najvažnijeg ureda u zemlji. Nakon otkrića na kraju druge sezone da se predsjednik neće kandidirati za nove izbore, treća sezona počinje tako što Selina, željna promaknuća, vrbuje stranačke aktiviste Iowe na potpisivanju svoje nove knjige "Neki novi počeci". Uskoro se Selina i njezino osoblje vraćaju u Washington za Mikeovo vjenčanje i saznaju da je ministar obrane Maddox dao ostavku.</desc>

Zapravo, ona se taman počinje izvlačiti iz problema... kad se globalna pandemija spoji s obiteljskom krizom i natjera je na neistraženi teritorij. U glavnoj je ulozi Abby McEnany.</desc>

Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija "Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka u potrazi za ljubavlju, stabilnom vezom, razumjevanjem, seksom... Carrie Bradshaw je njujorška novinarka koja svoja opažanja o ljubavi i strasti objavljuje u kolumni "Seks i grad". Inspiracije joj ne nedostaje, jer sve što mora jeste saslušati svoje prijateljice dok joj se povjeravaju ili prepričavaju svoj posljednji izlazak. Uz nju su Samantha, vlasnica PR agencije, koja je na samačkoj sceni vidjela i isprobala sve, galeristica Charlotte koja još vjeruje da ljubav pobjeđuje sve i cinična Miranda, advokatica u velikoj kompaniji koja ima najmanje vremena za romanse, jer joj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života. Tema za Carriene kolumne je i Faca, zgodni i misteriozni tajkun koji joj uvijek ubrza otkucaje srca. Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon i Sarah Jessica Parker uče nas važne lekcije o seksu, ljubavi, muškim i ženskim tajnama, uspješnim i neuspješnim taktikama, ispunjenim očekivanjima, skrivenim strahovima. Kada su u pitanju muškarci, veze i odnosi, ne možemo a da se ne zapitamo - da li smo zaista naučili sve?</desc>

This film is directed and edited by them and I was seeking for some effective scares. The first act was very formulaic, a group of teenagers decide to spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods now already I am disappointed. The dialogue was moronic along with the characters it is impossible to describe their stupidity as they continue to make poor choices within the situations. It got to the point where I became angry and annoyed but that eventually cooled off after the second act where the exceptional character development finally kicked in, I must agree there were a few cool scenes here and there but the film fails to provide any scares or intelligence within the plot. But during the third act the film explores inside of the spaceship and extends a little on the experimentations the aliens perform on the humans, which is exactly what any alien fan wanted to see, although there were a few scenes that left me confused weather to think this film is a horror or a comedy. After I gave this film a chance it started dosing off to a romantic thriller with the characters apologising and showing affection for each other again, and from that moment the whole film managed to collapse. My expectations were destroyed and the film itself remains a mystery since nothing really makes much sense. I would of appreciated more of an appearance of the aliens and a functioning plot, likable characters and classic "vicious brothers" scares. I will recommend this film to anyone who will watch with an open mind because watching this and expecting it to be the next alien will leave you vastly dissatisfied.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15448,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2014-10-17","keywords":"alien abduction,no survivors,videotape,vietnam war veteran,military cover up","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi377794329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMyNzM4OTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgxNDE4MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMyNzM4OTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgxNDE4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of friends on a weekend trip to a cabin in the woods find themselves terrorized by alien visitors.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020329/","name":"Brittany Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2238815/","name":"Freddie Stroma"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1536605/","name":"Jesse Moss"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4017355/","name":"Colin Minihan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0447381/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0413004/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452893/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4017355/","name":"Colin Minihan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3425513/","name":"Stuart Ortiz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4155547/","name":"The Vicious Brothers"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
