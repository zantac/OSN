Julius Caesar (Gerard Klein) and Augustus -nephew and heir of Cesar- fight against Pompeyo who's vanquished in Munda and Farsalia . At the 'Idus of March' Julio Cesar is killed by Bruto and Casio . Marco Antonius (Maximo Ghini) and Augustus (Benjamin Sadler as young Augustus Gaius Octavius) defeat them in Filipos . The second triumvirate is formed : Marco Antonio rules over Egypt , Lepido in Africa and Augustus governs over Rome and Hispania where he defeats Cantabros and Astures . Marco Antonius is married to Octavia (Elena Ballesteros) , Augustus's sister . After that , Marco Antonio was wedded to Cleopatra (Anna Valle) . Augustus declares war on both of them and after a successful military campaign , they are defeated by Augustus in ¨Actium¨ and he becomes the sole ruler of the Roman Empire . During his rule , Rome not only experiences a period of peace and prosperity , it is also an age in which both art and culture flourish . Augusto married Livia Drusilla (Charlotte Rampling) who becomes his most important political adviser , she had formerly given birth one son , named Tiberio . Julia (Vittoria Belvedere) , who was born in a previous marriage of Octavio , marries general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (Ken Duken) and had two children : Cayo and Lucio , early deceased . Tiberius will inherit the Roman Empire .\n\nThe movie runtime is overlong , it results to be a bit boring but it will appeal to history buffs . It's an European co-production made by some countries to put money in this lavish TV picture : Germany , France , Spain and England . The dialog , photography , costumes and art direction combine to cast a potent and powerful TV movie . Imposing sets , lavish gowns , good stars , opulent interiors , including great spectacle of crowd scenes well staged . As part of the contract deal , the British/Spanish/Italian/German productions hired players from each of the nations that financed the big budget for the making of the film ; as Spanish actors : Juan Diego Botto , Elena Ballesteros ; German : Ken Duken , Gottfried John ; Italian : Anna Valle , Vittoria Beldevere , Valeria D'Obici , Michelle Bevilacqua ; French : Charlotte Rampling , Gerard Klein ; and British : Peter O'Toole ; some of the players spoke good English with fluent accents , others were dubbed . \n\nFirst-rate set design by the production designer Titus Vossberg , whom the movie is dedicated , the film is very atmospheric , Roman time is well designed . The appropriate sets are based on actual Roman decorations and evocative villas . Scenarios are overwhelming : the Roman Forum , Roman Capitol , the temples , atrium...the settings are spectaculars . The wall painting of the study , Augustus' bedroom , corridors , Julia's lounges , Cleopatra's galleries were all inspired by the authentic wall paintings that originally came from villas and palaces belonging to high aristocracy and emperors . Giovanni Galasso's cinematography and Pino Donaggio's music are excellent. Direction by Roger Young is nice and adequate . Rating 6.5/10 . Charming , well worth seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-11-30","keywords":"grandmother murders grandson,caesar augustus,reference to augustus caesar,reference to augustus,reference to caesar augustus","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Augusta","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1052246297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAwYmM2YjktMTYzOC00ZGIxLTljMGYtYTliMTI4ZGVmOTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAwYmM2YjktMTYzOC00ZGIxLTljMGYtYTliMTI4ZGVmOTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000564/","name":"Peter O'Toole"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001648/","name":"Charlotte Rampling"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069722/","name":"Vittoria Belvedere"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002726/","name":"Roger Young"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064546/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068775/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042536/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0503609/","name":"Eric Lerner"}],"duration":"PT3H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Never have I seen a kiddie flick come along which is so clean, and yet still so entertaining at the same time. This odd blend of one of the best (The Matrix) and worst (Baby Geniuses) movies of 1999 is surprisingly exciting for something so "PG", and director and writer Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) manages to create loads of fun while still keeping the violence level down.\n\nHe manages to do all this by being incredibly inventive with his special effects. "Spy Kid's" is a visual fun house of ideas which are all so playfully intuned with kids and their level of interest. He comes up with things such as movable thumb people and floors that fall apart like puzzle pieces. Rodriguez also has a lot of fun with this topic, putting in loads of high tech equipment and transportation, which offer kids and adults an incredible ride which is most always played for humor and thrills.\n\nThe basic set up for "Spy Kids" is this. Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) were both spies working for different agencies, when a "hit" put out on each other brings them closer together. They decide to put away the spy work and live normal lives as husband and wife, and soon father and mother.\n\nBut the perfect family they dream about is far from. Their kids are keeping secrets from them, a trait from their former job that they feel they have passed on to their children. Their daughter Carmen (Alexa Vega) is skipping school, while Juni (Daryl Sabara) is being bullied at school and instead of telling his parents, just makes up a couple of imaginary friends.\n\nThey see how their past lives have affected their children, but before they can correct their wrong, their past catches up with them. They are thrown back into the spy game to investigate the capture of several other spies, but only end up being captured themselves.\n\nThe culprit also just happens to be Juni's favorite televison star, Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). Floop is after a brain prototype that Gregorio created years ago. If he can implant that into the heads of his robot and mutant henchmen, nothing can stop him from taking over the world and becoming the number one rated show on TV. But his other human henchmen Minion (played dastardly well by Tony Shalhoub) has other plans. Back home, the feuding siblings must learn to work together in order to save their parents and the world as they are tossed into the spy game as well.\n\nIt seems as if the best kids movies always have a family-like theme to them, and "Spy Kids" is no exception. Much of this movie is exciting, but then there are those other parts, which are to cuteness what Charlie's Angels was to sexy clad women. Some may accuse Rodriguez of turning corny on us all of a sudden, but luckily he is also working with some very funny material here, as well as with newcomer Daryl Sabara.\n\nHis partner Alexa Vega also comes off very strong in her role as his sister. Together they are a very good crime fighting team, and I look forward to seeing them in upcoming sequels. Alan Cumming is also very good, turning in an absent minded Willy Wonka style performance that also fits in very well with Rodriguez's style for this movie, which seems to be based largely around an amusement park surrounding a James Bond movie.\n\nHis film may be corny for older kids, but this is for the young ones and chances are you will never find a movie as decent and fun for them as this one is for a long time. Out of four stars, Spy Kids definitely scores a three."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112364,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-12-26","keywords":"machete cortez character,secret agent,rescue,spy,espionage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spy Kids","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1271963161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzRlMDU4M2YtYTQ1OC00ZDc0LTlmM2YtZTI0ZTQyOWM0NzcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzRlMDU4M2YtYTQ1OC00ZDc0LTlmM2YtZTI0ZTQyOWM0NzcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891786/","name":"Alexa PenaVega"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754512/","name":"Daryl Sabara"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035848/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Never have I seen a kiddie flick come along which is so clean, and yet still so entertaining at the same time. This odd blend of one of the best (The Matrix) and worst (Baby Geniuses) movies of 1999 is surprisingly exciting for something so "PG", and director and writer Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) manages to create loads of fun while still keeping the violence level down.\n\nHe manages to do all this by being incredibly inventive with his special effects. "Spy Kid's" is a visual fun house of ideas which are all so playfully intuned with kids and their level of interest. He comes up with things such as movable thumb people and floors that fall apart like puzzle pieces. Rodriguez also has a lot of fun with this topic, putting in loads of high tech equipment and transportation, which offer kids and adults an incredible ride which is most always played for humor and thrills.\n\nThe basic set up for "Spy Kids" is this. Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) were both spies working for different agencies, when a "hit" put out on each other brings them closer together. They decide to put away the spy work and live normal lives as husband and wife, and soon father and mother.\n\nBut the perfect family they dream about is far from. Their kids are keeping secrets from them, a trait from their former job that they feel they have passed on to their children. Their daughter Carmen (Alexa Vega) is skipping school, while Juni (Daryl Sabara) is being bullied at school and instead of telling his parents, just makes up a couple of imaginary friends.\n\nThey see how their past lives have affected their children, but before they can correct their wrong, their past catches up with them. They are thrown back into the spy game to investigate the capture of several other spies, but only end up being captured themselves.\n\nThe culprit also just happens to be Juni's favorite televison star, Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). Floop is after a brain prototype that Gregorio created years ago. If he can implant that into the heads of his robot and mutant henchmen, nothing can stop him from taking over the world and becoming the number one rated show on TV. But his other human henchmen Minion (played dastardly well by Tony Shalhoub) has other plans. Back home, the feuding siblings must learn to work together in order to save their parents and the world as they are tossed into the spy game as well.\n\nIt seems as if the best kids movies always have a family-like theme to them, and "Spy Kids" is no exception. Much of this movie is exciting, but then there are those other parts, which are to cuteness what Charlie's Angels was to sexy clad women. Some may accuse Rodriguez of turning corny on us all of a sudden, but luckily he is also working with some very funny material here, as well as with newcomer Daryl Sabara.\n\nHis partner Alexa Vega also comes off very strong in her role as his sister. Together they are a very good crime fighting team, and I look forward to seeing them in upcoming sequels. Alan Cumming is also very good, turning in an absent minded Willy Wonka style performance that also fits in very well with Rodriguez's style for this movie, which seems to be based largely around an amusement park surrounding a James Bond movie.\n\nHis film may be corny for older kids, but this is for the young ones and chances are you will never find a movie as decent and fun for them as this one is for a long time. Out of four stars, Spy Kids definitely scores a three.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112364,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-12-26","keywords":"machete cortez character,secret agent,rescue,spy,espionage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spy Kids","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1271963161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzRlMDU4M2YtYTQ1OC00ZDc0LTlmM2YtZTI0ZTQyOWM0NzcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzRlMDU4M2YtYTQ1OC00ZDc0LTlmM2YtZTI0ZTQyOWM0NzcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891786/","name":"Alexa PenaVega","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754512/","name":"Daryl Sabara","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035848/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Last year, the highlight of the festival for me was American Beauty.  This year, it would have to be (so far) Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".\n\nBeing of Asian descent, I've seen my share of wu xia genre movies to last me a life time.  However, most of them are so centred on the fighting, that they forget the rest of the elements that are involed.  The movie turns into one long scripted fighting scene with maybe a slight hint of story. Crouching Tiger, on the other hand realizes these issues, and builds these oh-so entertaining action sequences into an epic with typical asian themes such as true love and honour.\n\nBeing an epic, one would expect the usual long takes and establishing shots, and boy does it ever look beautiful.  Traversing through a myriad of regions spanning the lengh of China (from the deserts to bamboo forests, to mountains high in the clouds), the film soley based on its asthetic properties is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour.  And then there's the cinemetography.  Wow!  The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous.  If your jaw dropped when you saw Rome and its coliseum in Gladiator, wait until you see ancient Beijing recreated on the screen!\n\nOkay, so it's a good looking movie.  What about the story?  The complexity of the plot is rather sparse, probably reminiscent of epics such as Braveheart or Gladiator, which is by no means a bad thing.  Although both Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeo did have major parts, this movie belongs mostly to Zhang Ziyi who IMHO did an amazing job playing a very complex role (one which required her to represent nobily as a princess, naivness, as well as show inner strength).  Mainly concentrating on her unwillingness to give in to the ideals of an arranged marriage, the decently written script adds a story of an old warrior trying to retire and a 300+ year old sword.\n\nAll in all, this film blends story, well choreographed action, and a stylistic eye to create a mythilogical piece that not only represents the wu xia genre justly by doing it well, but also contributes to raising the quality of filmmaking usually applied in the making of a similar type of film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260429,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie doesn't try too hard, is free of the clichés that often serve instead of fresh ideas and has a great shoot-out where the surprises and action keep you on the edge of your seat without trying to overwhelm with gore and jerky camera work.\n\nGo see it, you'll enjoy it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-02-18","keywords":"interpol,money laundering,post punk,lyon france,milan italy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The International: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi815137561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Interpol Agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) pool their resources in an attempt to break up an international arms dealing ring financed by a high-profile bank.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028338/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2545235/","name":"Eric Warren Singer"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.\n\nAnd the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.\n\nThe script is witty and full of dark humour, "I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you.", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.\n\nA special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes.

For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.\n\nAnd the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.\n\nThe script is witty and full of dark humour, "I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you.", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.\n\nA special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).\n\nFor once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.\n\nAn 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":297702,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Horror"],"datePublished":"1996-01-19","keywords":"stripper,sex offender,held hostage,u.s. mexico border,priest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"From Dusk Till Dawn","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3052320281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVjZDY5ODAtZDg2Ny00ZDJlLTk2YzgtNmEzMjZiOWFkYmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVjZDY5ODAtZDg2Ny00ZDJlLTk2YzgtNmEzMjZiOWFkYmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for From Dusk Till Dawn","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000172/","name":"Harvey Keitel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000496/","name":"Juliette Lewis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019267/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0870559/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476071/","name":"Robert Kurtzman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Assisted by an abnormally-skilled gang of other military victims, Bazil endeavours to bring down the two perpetrators and strike a damaging blow at the entire industry.\n\nThe aforementioned plot could potentially deliver a grim and bloodthirsty heist thriller, but French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has other intentions. The opening scene in which the little boy Bazil (here played by the young Noé Boon) witnesses his father being blown to pieces amongst the familiar scenery of sandy deserts and Arab costumes, and the following event of Bazil being accidentally shot in the head by a rogue army officer, carry some suspense and sorrow. These serve as a succinct and sufficiently grave acknowledgement of the atrocities of terrorism, yet thankfully Jeunet has the intelligence and frivolity to drop the solemnity at this point, avoiding overstatement of the point and unleashing riches of wonderfully liberating and delightfully unpretentious entertainment.\n\nBazil's accomplices, or rather, kind and caring companions, are an extremely lovable and splendidly colourful bunch of very uncomplicated characters. Living in a cosy makeshift home, they support each other using their special talents, which range from the remarkable innovation of an expert inventor (a charming Michel Crémadès) to the incredible flexibility of a charismatic contortionist (Julie Ferrier's infectious spunk matches perfectly with Dany Boon's priceless quirks).

Assisted by an abnormally-skilled gang of other military victims, Bazil endeavours to bring down the two perpetrators and strike a damaging blow at the entire industry.\n\nThe aforementioned plot could potentially deliver a grim and bloodthirsty heist thriller, but French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has other intentions. The opening scene in which the little boy Bazil (here played by the young Noé Boon) witnesses his father being blown to pieces amongst the familiar scenery of sandy deserts and Arab costumes, and the following event of Bazil being accidentally shot in the head by a rogue army officer, carry some suspense and sorrow. These serve as a succinct and sufficiently grave acknowledgement of the atrocities of terrorism, yet thankfully Jeunet has the intelligence and frivolity to drop the solemnity at this point, avoiding overstatement of the point and unleashing riches of wonderfully liberating and delightfully unpretentious entertainment.\n\nBazil's accomplices, or rather, kind and caring companions, are an extremely lovable and splendidly colourful bunch of very uncomplicated characters. Living in a cosy makeshift home, they support each other using their special talents, which range from the remarkable innovation of an expert inventor (a charming Michel Crémadès) to the incredible flexibility of a charismatic contortionist (Julie Ferrier's infectious spunk matches perfectly with Dany Boon's priceless quirks). Their plans to foil the two villains are extremely creative and utterly unexpected, providing most of the film's subtle and beautifully simplistic humour.\n\nAlthough the film's simplicity does comes at a cost, dragging it far away from Oscar-worthy greatness. It also results in a slight lag in the middle, where its lack of depth truly takes its toll after the initial burst of exuberance momentarily ceases to resonate.

It will the box office winner on Memorial Day weekend. Perfect time to come out with a football picture because all the NFL fans are fed up with Arena football and thirsty for any real football.\n\nWell, what can I say about the movie? Loved it! Very entertaining. You could get into the characters, no matter how despicable they were and you were rooting for them. Of course the story is an old one. They filmed it in 1974 with Burt Reynolds and it is about prisoners playing a football game against the guards. It's a comedy, but boy it is Violent with a capital V.\n\nIt is a real macho man movie and everyone is going to love it. Adam Sandler gets beat up or beat down a lot in the movie, they give the best lines and jokes to Chris Rock and there will be a few other Saturday Night Live people you will recognize in it. There are a lot of scenes of cheap shots and unsportsmanlike conduct. Very physical, very brutal. Some scenes will make you cringe. You will feel their pain. Not blood and guts with stabbings or shootings, but extreme football hurts and hits.\n\nYes it's a comedy and yes it's funny, but also ultra violent, did I mention that already? Now I know why I gave up on football in high school and focused more on Cross Country and Track &amp; Field...because I realized I would live longer if I competed in a sport where no one is trying to injury me or knock you out of competition.\n\nA great film? No, but people will feel they got their money's worth and yes, it will be popular on DVD with outtakes and behind the scenes footage. I can't see it getting a PG-13 rating, not with all the language and use of the "N" word by the cookie cutter, steroid popping sadistic guards.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":168858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-08-10","keywords":"frame up,scantily clad female,voyeur,voyeurism,football helmet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Longest Yard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi821428505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781842/","name":"Peter Segal"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748665/","name":"Albert S.

It will the box office winner on Memorial Day weekend. Perfect time to come out with a football picture because all the NFL fans are fed up with Arena football and thirsty for any real football.\n\nWell, what can I say about the movie? Loved it! Very entertaining. You could get into the characters, no matter how despicable they were and you were rooting for them. Of course the story is an old one. They filmed it in 1974 with Burt Reynolds and it is about prisoners playing a football game against the guards. It's a comedy, but boy it is Violent with a capital V.\n\nIt is a real macho man movie and everyone is going to love it. Adam Sandler gets beat up or beat down a lot in the movie, they give the best lines and jokes to Chris Rock and there will be a few other Saturday Night Live people you will recognize in it. There are a lot of scenes of cheap shots and unsportsmanlike conduct. Very physical, very brutal. Some scenes will make you cringe. You will feel their pain. Not blood and guts with stabbings or shootings, but extreme football hurts and hits.\n\nYes it's a comedy and yes it's funny, but also ultra violent, did I mention that already? Now I know why I gave up on football in high school and focused more on Cross Country and Track &amp; Field...because I realized I would live longer if I competed in a sport where no one is trying to injury me or knock you out of competition.\n\nA great film? No, but people will feel they got their money's worth and yes, it will be popular on DVD with outtakes and behind the scenes footage. I can't see it getting a PG-13 rating, not with all the language and use of the "N" word by the cookie cutter, steroid popping sadistic guards.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":168858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-08-10","keywords":"frame up,scantily clad female,voyeur,voyeurism,football helmet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Longest Yard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi821428505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781842/","name":"Peter Segal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748665/","name":"Albert S.

In fact, I don't even like watching TV because it is so superficial sometimes. But this is a must see for everyone at all ages. The details remind me of so many things, down to the cages that look a bit bigger than ours for storing gear and stuff, and the absolutely normal looking CIA gal which is so true to reality. And so much smarter than everyone else ! Even the fast chats of some of the lines that a few reviewers found too fast to understand, is actually true to life. A lot of military people are fast talkers. They think they sound smart if they can say things real fast. That is the culture. But as true as the writing is and as close as the settings and actions are to reality, the feel of the show is the real gem. As an audience we feel what they feel, especially losing people from our lives who gave up on us. This includes the almost automatic drive to jump up and get to duty that is so common in those who act from dedication to this country and saving lives. One of the reviewers said it is good mindless fun. Its okay to not see further than that. It is just fun for some. Not everyone comes to dinner for the same thing. Not everyone wants to take the oath and do the dance, and run the North Island obstacle course over and over until it works. Not everyone wants to feel what it means to really care about putting away bad people to protect good people. But for those who want to know more, this shows what it is like to be a quiet patriot. It shows love of country and family and brotherhood without forcing watchers to put sand in their mouths and wave American flags. And it really does touch on things going on today in each of those countries. It is not all Hollywood. I did the jumps from the C17s. It is cold up there. But some people do jump a little exposed at times. Not everyone covers everything exposed perfectly on every jump. I thank you for reminding me who I am. What a gift you give to anyone who will just watch ! I think when this show stops its run which I hope is a long time from now, each of you involved will remember this as one of the most important projects of your lives. And each of the actors is so good that none of it looks like acting. I salute you all for an incredible job well done.

And so much smarter than everyone else ! Even the fast chats of some of the lines that a few reviewers found too fast to understand, is actually true to life. A lot of military people are fast talkers. They think they sound smart if they can say things real fast. That is the culture. But as true as the writing is and as close as the settings and actions are to reality, the feel of the show is the real gem.

Not everyone wants to take the oath and do the dance, and run the North Island obstacle course over and over until it works. Not everyone wants to feel what it means to really care about putting away bad people to protect good people. But for those who want to know more, this shows what it is like to be a quiet patriot. It shows love of country and family and brotherhood without forcing watchers to put sand in their mouths and wave American flags. And it really does touch on things going on today in each of those countries. It is not all Hollywood. I did the jumps from the C17s. It is cold up there. But some people do jump a little exposed at times. Not everyone covers everything exposed perfectly on every jump. I thank you for reminding me who I am. What a gift you give to anyone who will just watch ! I think when this show stops its run which I hope is a long time from now, each of you involved will remember this as one of the most important projects of your lives. And each of the actors is so good that none of it looks like acting. I salute you all for an incredible job well done.

When it started I knew this was going to be different; most of the characters didn't look like anime characters, they looked more like characters from western cartoons of the 1930s. This fitted in with the feel of the whole film which was a 1920s/1930s view of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's film of the same name.\n\nSet in the city state of Metropolis where the robot underclass must stay in their designated areas and a scientist is building a robot that looks like a girl but is destined to run a new skyscraper known as the Ziggurat. Into this city comes a Japanese private detective and his nephew Kenichi who are seeking to arrest the scientist for organ trafficking. The state's de facto leader Duke Red's adopted son Rock is determined to destroy the robot thinking his father is replacing him. Rock starts a fire in the lab. During this the robot is activated and escapes with Kenichi although neither know that she isn't human. Rock continues to hunt them as the flee through the various layers of the city to a climax in the mysterious Ziggurat.\n\nI loved the retro feel to the animation along with a sound track that also felt like it was from that time. The use of the song "I Can't Stop Loving You" during the climactic scene was inspired. Even if you don't normally like animation this is worth watching as it is a good story which is well told.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20822,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2001-05-26","keywords":"robot,synthetic human,city,future,based on comic book","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metropolis","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3878271001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4NDAxYjEtNWRkMi00Y2ZhLTk5ZWQtMmFkODI5NmFlYjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4NDAxYjEtNWRkMi00Y2ZhLTk5ZWQtMmFkODI5NmFlYjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Metropolis"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299192/","name":"Toshio Furukawa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918334/","name":"Scott Weinger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131157/","name":"Yuka Imoto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0727336/","name":"Rintaro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080697/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064941/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195909/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0856804/","name":"Osamu Tezuka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0960028/","name":"Katsuhiro Ôtomo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359584/","name":"Marc Handler"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When it started I knew this was going to be different; most of the characters didn't look like anime characters, they looked more like characters from western cartoons of the 1930s. This fitted in with the feel of the whole film which was a 1920s/1930s view of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's film of the same name.\n\nSet in the city state of Metropolis where the robot underclass must stay in their designated areas and a scientist is building a robot that looks like a girl but is destined to run a new skyscraper known as the Ziggurat. Into this city comes a Japanese private detective and his nephew Kenichi who are seeking to arrest the scientist for organ trafficking. The state's de facto leader Duke Red's adopted son Rock is determined to destroy the robot thinking his father is replacing him. Rock starts a fire in the lab. During this the robot is activated and escapes with Kenichi although neither know that she isn't human. Rock continues to hunt them as the flee through the various layers of the city to a climax in the mysterious Ziggurat.\n\nI loved the retro feel to the animation along with a sound track that also felt like it was from that time. The use of the song "I Can't Stop Loving You" during the climactic scene was inspired. Even if you don't normally like animation this is worth watching as it is a good story which is well told.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20822,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2001-05-26","keywords":"robot,synthetic human,city,future,based on comic book","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Metropolis","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3878271001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4NDAxYjEtNWRkMi00Y2ZhLTk5ZWQtMmFkODI5NmFlYjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4NDAxYjEtNWRkMi00Y2ZhLTk5ZWQtMmFkODI5NmFlYjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Metropolis","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299192/","name":"Toshio Furukawa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918334/","name":"Scott Weinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131157/","name":"Yuka Imoto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0727336/","name":"Rintaro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080697/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064941/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0856804/","name":"Osamu Tezuka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0960028/","name":"Katsuhiro Ôtomo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359584/","name":"Marc Handler"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In fact, I don't even like watching TV because it is so superficial sometimes. But this is a must see for everyone at all ages. The details remind me of so many things, down to the cages that look a bit bigger than ours for storing gear and stuff, and the absolutely normal looking CIA gal which is so true to reality. And so much smarter than everyone else ! Even the fast chats of some of the lines that a few reviewers found too fast to understand, is actually true to life. A lot of military people are fast talkers. They think they sound smart if they can say things real fast. That is the culture. But as true as the writing is and as close as the settings and actions are to reality, the feel of the show is the real gem. As an audience we feel what they feel, especially losing people from our lives who gave up on us. This includes the almost automatic drive to jump up and get to duty that is so common in those who act from dedication to this country and saving lives. One of the reviewers said it is good mindless fun. Its okay to not see further than that. It is just fun for some. Not everyone comes to dinner for the same thing. Not everyone wants to take the oath and do the dance, and run the North Island obstacle course over and over until it works. Not everyone wants to feel what it means to really care about putting away bad people to protect good people. But for those who want to know more, this shows what it is like to be a quiet patriot. It shows love of country and family and brotherhood without forcing watchers to put sand in their mouths and wave American flags. And it really does touch on things going on today in each of those countries. It is not all Hollywood. I did the jumps from the C17s. It is cold up there. But some people do jump a little exposed at times. Not everyone covers everything exposed perfectly on every jump. I thank you for reminding me who I am. What a gift you give to anyone who will just watch ! I think when this show stops its run which I hope is a long time from now, each of you involved will remember this as one of the most important projects of your lives. And each of the actors is so good that none of it looks like acting. I salute you all for an incredible job well done.

In fact, I don't even like watching TV because it is so superficial sometimes. But this is a must see for everyone at all ages. The details remind me of so many things, down to the cages that look a bit bigger than ours for storing gear and stuff, and the absolutely normal looking CIA gal which is so true to reality. And so much smarter than everyone else ! Even the fast chats of some of the lines that a few reviewers found too fast to understand, is actually true to life. A lot of military people are fast talkers. They think they sound smart if they can say things real fast. That is the culture. But as true as the writing is and as close as the settings and actions are to reality, the feel of the show is the real gem. As an audience we feel what they feel, especially losing people from our lives who gave up on us. This includes the almost automatic drive to jump up and get to duty that is so common in those who act from dedication to this country and saving lives. One of the reviewers said it is good mindless fun. Its okay to not see further than that. It is just fun for some. Not everyone comes to dinner for the same thing. Not everyone wants to take the oath and do the dance, and run the North Island obstacle course over and over until it works. Not everyone wants to feel what it means to really care about putting away bad people to protect good people. But for those who want to know more, this shows what it is like to be a quiet patriot. It shows love of country and family and brotherhood without forcing watchers to put sand in their mouths and wave American flags. And it really does touch on things going on today in each of those countries. It is not all Hollywood. I did the jumps from the C17s. It is cold up there. But some people do jump a little exposed at times. Not everyone covers everything exposed perfectly on every jump. I thank you for reminding me who I am. What a gift you give to anyone who will just watch ! I think when this show stops its run which I hope is a long time from now, each of you involved will remember this as one of the most important projects of your lives. And each of the actors is so good that none of it looks like acting. I salute you all for an incredible job well done.

Nolan i Bredford, koji je imao samo alergijsku reakciju na primljene lijekove, obračunaju se s teroristom. Dva tjedna kasnije, Nolan je u svom novom domu, dok novaci primaju rezultate položenih ispita. Svi su prošli, no West je sumnjičav prema rezutatima. Nakon što su Nolan i Grey svjedočili pljački u trgovini policijske uniforme tim doznaje za plan koji uključuje lažno uniformirane policajce. Kasnije pronalaze jednog od pljačkaša mrtvog nakon što su ga partneri ubili i zapalili njegovo tijelo.</desc>

The trailer was a slice of many of the best scenes but, unfortunately the real film falls so sadly short of good storyline due to poor dialog and some jerky acting that the viewer struggles to make sense of the various actors.\n\nIf this film had been prescreened (proof read) any average movie-goer would have pointed out just how poorly made it was. I sensed that Tyler Perry gave a over acted performance. I really wanted to like this film when it first came out but, it just was so boring and unimaginative I began to realize that it was due to faulty construction of scenes and character's dialog. This was mostly due to the director.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33231,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2013-01-02","keywords":"interrupted sex,scene of the crime,character name as title,woman wears a bikini,woman on top sex","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3041501721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMTM2MjE1NDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDUzMzE5OTc@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMTM2MjE1NDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDUzMzE5OTc@._V1_.jpg","description":"After Washington DC detective Alex Cross is told that a family member has been murdered, he vows to track down the killer.

Condon has quite evidently put a lot of effort into writing and directing the film, and without much question, his efforts have paid off with success.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"sexuality,character name as title,surname as title,lgbt plus,sex","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kinsey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224292121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001473/","name":"Laura Linney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I will miss it a lot.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57121,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-02-06","keywords":"father daughter relationship,homicide detective,police procedural,police detective,based on novel","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0920038/","name":"Titus Welliver","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373100/","name":"Jamie Hector","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0032628/","name":"Amy Aquino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483993/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420833/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0653899/","name":"Eric Ellis Overmyer"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch the Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3258368025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU4MWFhMWYtMjdmNi00ZDNkLWI4NWMtNWJiNjBlYjFkMmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU4MWFhMWYtMjdmNi00ZDNkLWI4NWMtNWJiNjBlYjFkMmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Is it serious or is it trivial? Why is George so silent? When his brother throws a wrench at him, hitting him in the head, he leaves without a word. He remains behind at the hospital to be 'be with' and console the sister-in-law; she does all the talking but he doesn't say a word.

While "Slumdog Millionaire" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.\n\n"Slumdog Millionaire" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.\n\nDanny Boyle ("28 Days Later," "Sunshine") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.\n\nWhile the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. "Slumdog" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.\n\nIt's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. \n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":817213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It at times seems to take itself seriously and then at other points not at all. The performances are all... There. Nothing really great to report.

Murrow looks to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0433383/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"schappe1"},"dateCreated":"2005-11-13","inLanguage":"English","name":"When Things Were Black and White","reviewBody":"I've had the "Edward R. Murrow" Collection from CBS for years and have enjoyed watching it's biography of Murrow, the complete Milo Radulovich, McCarthy and Annie Lee Moss shows many times. I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama "Good Night and Good Luck". As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.\n\nThere are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of "You Are There", a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being "there" when he didn't really want to be.\n\nWhat really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was "The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post"  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Murrow looks to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0433383/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"schappe1","dateCreated":"2005-11-13","inLanguage":"English","name":"When Things Were Black and White","reviewBody":"I've had the "Edward R. Murrow" Collection from CBS for years and have enjoyed watching it's biography of Murrow, the complete Milo Radulovich, McCarthy and Annie Lee Moss shows many times. I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama "Good Night and Good Luck". As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.\n\nThere are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of "You Are There", a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being "there" when he didn't really want to be.\n\nWhat really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was "The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post"  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'd never even heard of them. Having seen the film, I'll make it a priority to take a look. The film has a strong "Harry Potter" feel, what with the heroic, much put-upon British children, and the fantastical setting. If J.K. Rowling had cast Lord Voldemort as a nefarious villain out to steal the Potter family fortune, and made Ron and Hermione Harry's siblings, I imagine it would look something like this. Jim Carrey swallows huge chunks of scenery in his portrayal of Count Olaf, one of the most despicable villains to grace the silver screen in a while. The four child actors are all superb, especially the very attractive Emily Browning as the inventor, Violet. The film comes with a wonderfully disturbing climax, and a enjoyably happy epilogue that hints at many future misfortunes for the Baudelaire children. I'll be there. 9/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-04-13","keywords":"children,dark comedy,orphan,steampunk,uncle niece relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi513147161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY4ZWFkZDQtMWFhMC00NzFlLTljMjQtYzI4MzMyMmIyMGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY4ZWFkZDQtMWFhMC00NzFlLTljMjQtYzI4MzMyMmIyMGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797869/","name":"Brad Silberling"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330565/","name":"Robert Gordon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1274516/","name":"Daniel Handler"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'd never even heard of them. Having seen the film, I'll make it a priority to take a look. The film has a strong "Harry Potter" feel, what with the heroic, much put-upon British children, and the fantastical setting. If J.K. Rowling had cast Lord Voldemort as a nefarious villain out to steal the Potter family fortune, and made Ron and Hermione Harry's siblings, I imagine it would look something like this. Jim Carrey swallows huge chunks of scenery in his portrayal of Count Olaf, one of the most despicable villains to grace the silver screen in a while. The four child actors are all superb, especially the very attractive Emily Browning as the inventor, Violet. The film comes with a wonderfully disturbing climax, and a enjoyably happy epilogue that hints at many future misfortunes for the Baudelaire children. I'll be there. 9/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-04-13","keywords":"children,dark comedy,orphan,steampunk,uncle niece relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi513147161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY4ZWFkZDQtMWFhMC00NzFlLTljMjQtYzI4MzMyMmIyMGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY4ZWFkZDQtMWFhMC00NzFlLTljMjQtYzI4MzMyMmIyMGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797869/","name":"Brad Silberling"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330565/","name":"Robert Gordon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1274516/","name":"Daniel Handler"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's as if Ken Loach had made a film about the struggles of a single African mother with a debilitating medical condition fighting to survive. Pili faces hardship and the worse kind of exploitation however there are no evil characters here, everyone has a point of view, which makes this a profound film about the human condition. The film-makers show respect to the subject matter, it is never patronising and there are no silly or unbelievable scenes.

    <desc lang="hr">Richard Jewell: Directed by Clint Eastwood. With Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell, Brandon Stanley, Ryan Boz. Security guard Richard Jewell is an instant hero after foiling a bomb attack at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but his life becomes a nightmare when the FBI leaks to the media that he is a suspect in the case." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt3513548/","name":"Richard Jewell","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFlODg1MTEtZTJhOC00OTY1LWE0YzctZjRlODdkYWY5ZDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU1NzU3MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Security guard Richard Jewell is an instant hero after foiling a bomb attack at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but his life becomes a nightmare when the FBI leaks to the media that he is a suspect in the case.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3513548/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ferguson-6"},"dateCreated":"2019-12-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"try these shoes on","reviewBody":"Greetings again from the darkness. Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,headstrong woman,detective,surname in series title,equality for women","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I am watching with someone who is hard of hearing and has to mostly read the script. Last night they were talking of furniture in the French Louis XV style. It is always read as Louis the fifteenth or often in French Quinze (pronounced cans - and that is exactly what the close caption said in the style of Louis cans - I had to explain that one to my mom!) Then a few moments later, Miss Marple talked about the problem of yarn balls vs skeins, except the close caption said yarn scans. So confusing for the reader. There are mistakes and horrible scripting throughout almost every episode.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6990,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-12-12","keywords":"united kingdom,murder,detective,female detective,england","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568603/","name":"Geraldine McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571549/","name":"Julia McKenzie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161410/","name":"Stephen Churchett"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104279/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103605/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041824/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4158173977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has all the elements to make it an award winning piece. Great complicated characters that work well with each other, mystery, intrigue, excitement, shell shock, suggestive, authentic and genuine. Who new that Germany had the ability to produce a show like this that would compete with BBC period series. It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s.

How is it that something can come along, remind us of something else and immediately it gets panned as unoriginal? There is nothing new under the sun. This quote itself is nearly 3000 years old. It was true then and it's true now. Yes, this show reminded me of Moonlighting with a dash of Castle as the remade man who considers a different career. However, it dares to consider than just "bringing the killer to justice". There have been resolutions to stories that I didn't see coming or consider to be regular justice. Remember, these guys are PRIVATE EYES, not cops. Justice doesn't have to include iron bars. I like the chemistry between the leads and having Jason Priestly raise a blind daughter whilst having his own dad around for a foil keeps him grounded. Not to mention that, for once, here is a show with wide appeal that is made in Canada that doesn't pretend to be somewhere else. I've enjoyed the tour of her cities and countryside without it being purported to be "somewhere in the US". Yes, Private Eyes does draw from ingredients we're familiar with, but then some of the greatest cocktails are made from stuff we never consider combining before.

How is it that something can come along, remind us of something else and immediately it gets panned as unoriginal? There is nothing new under the sun. This quote itself is nearly 3000 years old. It was true then and it's true now. Yes, this show reminded me of Moonlighting with a dash of Castle as the remade man who considers a different career. However, it dares to consider than just "bringing the killer to justice". There have been resolutions to stories that I didn't see coming or consider to be regular justice. Remember, these guys are PRIVATE EYES, not cops. Justice doesn't have to include iron bars. I like the chemistry between the leads and having Jason Priestly raise a blind daughter whilst having his own dad around for a foil keeps him grounded. Not to mention that, for once, here is a show with wide appeal that is made in Canada that doesn't pretend to be somewhere else. I've enjoyed the tour of her cities and countryside without it being purported to be "somewhere in the US". Yes, Private Eyes does draw from ingredients we're familiar with, but then some of the greatest cocktails are made from stuff we never consider combining before. Give it a taste!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-05-26","keywords":"hockey,body part in title,body part in series title,two word series title,two word title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000594/","name":"Jason Priestley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120797/","name":"Cindy Sampson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281284/","name":"Barry Flatman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150938/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2850421/","name":"Tim Kilby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259275/","name":"Shelley Eriksen"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Private Eyes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi576699417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Private Eyes"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like Law and Order the show puts more focus on the cases themselves rather than the personal lives of the characters, but The Closer opens the door a little more. Kyra is really what draws in people to this show, it's something about her character's charm despite the fact the character is from the often ridiculed south. The writers were also keen to make Brenda Johnson a real person, not some super-hero who always wins and always knows the every move of the bad guy; sometimes Brenda makes mistakes and pays for them and sometimes she is insecure about her looks or being freshly relocated to the big city of Los Angelos. The show just started this summer and I wish it the best of luck, I hope it can become as acclaimed as all the other crime dramas we've got on the airwaves today","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together. The sets and costumes are well done (suitable for the time period),and highly detailed. \n\nThe story line doesn't explore any real substantial questions of politics, culture, war, or social values...yet. It's enjoyable, mindless entertainment, excellently done, with great potential for more robust story lines. Although the episodes might not have been filmed in the release-date order, the staging, story, and characters appeared to mature as the first season progressed.\n\nBut there is one travesty: They do a disservice to a good actor, and to women everywhere, by not giving their excellent female star better billing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-13","keywords":"psychotronic series,tv mini series","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922995/","name":"Michael Weston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542118/","name":"Stephen Mangan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146945/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330730/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0131363/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395924/","name":"David Hoselton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0864435/","name":"David N.

(Except Conan Doyle's suits, which get louder as the series goes on, a possible sign of growing confidence in the characterization of the character.) \n\nThe hook is that Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have partnered to solve murders that have some connection to the supernatural and/or spiritual. It's set in the wrong time period for Houdini and Doyle to have been associated. A choice was made to make it Edwardian rather than in the more accurate 1920s. They use modern language and the modern music is intentionally unsettling. The series relies heavily on the old theater maxim of "a willing suspension of disbelief."\n\nAnd it's highly entertaining. The actors are personable and talented. It's definitely an ensemble cast that works well together. The sets and costumes are well done (suitable for the time period),and highly detailed. \n\nThe story line doesn't explore any real substantial questions of politics, culture, war, or social values...yet. It's enjoyable, mindless entertainment, excellently done, with great potential for more robust story lines. Although the episodes might not have been filmed in the release-date order, the staging, story, and characters appeared to mature as the first season progressed.\n\nBut there is one travesty: They do a disservice to a good actor, and to women everywhere, by not giving their excellent female star better billing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2738,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-13","keywords":"psychotronic series,tv mini series","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922995/","name":"Michael Weston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542118/","name":"Stephen Mangan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146945/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0131363/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395924/","name":"David Hoselton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0864435/","name":"David N.

    <desc lang="hr">Nakon Charliejeve smrti, milijarder Walden useljava se u kuću na plaži s Alanom i Jakeom. Depresivan, Walden se oslanja na Alana koji će ga trenirati. "Dva i pol muškarca" prikazuje život dvojice braće, sina/nećaka i mnoštva žena koje ih okružuju. Točnije, Charlie Harper dobrostojeći je neženja s kućom na obali, Mercedesom u garaži i znanjem vještog ophođenja sa ženama. Ali njegov opušteni život u Malibuu ometaju njegov ukočeni i napeti brat Alan i Alanov sin Jake, koji već godinama žive kod njega. Unatoč kompleksnosti njihovih života i njihovim međusobnim napetim odnosima, Charlie i Alan jedno imaju zajedničko: obojica vole Jakea i žele mu samo najbolje. Zato uspijevaju stvoriti malu obiteljsku zajednicu u kojoj bi svatko od njih mogao postati bolji čovjek.</desc>

Anna Faris i dobitnica nagrade Emmy®, Allison Janney, glume u novoj komediji Chucka Lorrea - satiričan pogled na pravu obiteljsku ljubav i disfunkcionalnost. Odnedavno trijezna samohrana majka, muči se odgojiti dvoje djece u svijetu punom iskušenja.</desc>

So when I was at first annoyed and angered by the beginning of this movie, I passed it off to his soon-to-come deeper agenda, which in "Dr. T..." never arrives.\n\nI loathe this movie.  Let me count the ways:\n\n1. (Most importantly) We are led to empathize with a man who believes he loves too much, too hard, and hence, the consequences.  This, if played out, would be great, as he gets his come-uppance, realizes the self-delusion and that his life and ways with women is a lie.  But that's not what happens. We are supposed to feel sorry for and sympathize with him the entire way, even as he cheats, avoids true responsibility and, despite what the ending is supposed to say, never changes.  Rather than the boy-birth being a sign of evolution/change/enlightenment, it debunks all that came before, in fact saying that all these women were the problem all along.  Instead of being a witty examination of flawed Dallas women, it concludes with a tacked-on non-epiphany, which by its very existence makes everything before it misogynistic, and none of the characters likeable.\n\n2.  Watch how many times Altman works in gratuitous nudity, like an 11 yr. old peeping tom.  When he shows Janine Turner's derriere-crack, at the end of her scene, it's not Richard Gere following it with his eyes,  it's the CAMERA, as if to say, "hey, look at this" -- like a little elbow in our sides.\n\n3.  He does the same thing often at the end of scenes, swinging the camera with a wink to pick up a sign, a heavy-handed metaphor or scene-link that is beginning film school pretentious artifice at its worst.\n\n4.  The editing and cinematography again is of the film-school variety, and at often times is like a rough cut.\n\n5.  Helen Hunt, who for years has been trying to convince us she's newly "sexy," is so self-conscious that we never can buy into any kind of character.  I am sick of her flinging her hair.\n\n6.  The camera holds so long on the golf sequences, as if to say - "these actors really can play golf," which they really don't very well.  But it becomes a call-attention lingering as opposed to a mere setting for dialogue.\n\n7.  The overly intrusive soundtrack by Lyle Lovett may be close to the worst in history.  Not only does it blot out large sequences of dialogue, and call attention to itself mindlessly at every turn, it actually has lyrics which say exactly what's going on in the scene.\n\n8.  The writing and dialogue are extremely sophomoric; very few times do the people seem real in what they're saying, and often they resort to movie cliche-speak.\n\n9.  Gere has a few good real moments, but the direction hurts him as well.\n\n10.  Altman's trademark "everyone speaking at once," in this movie is contrived and annoying.\n\n11. (And maybe worst of all) this movie made me replay all the movies of Altman that I really like and see that many of tendencies above that I criticize are prevalent in ALL of his movies, now tempering my enjoyment of them.  I now see a old lecher with a misogynistic bent and an arrested development, calling attention to his weaknesses in a pretentious and juvenile way.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19346,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"gynecologist,public nudity,vagina,cheerleader,lesbian kiss","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dr. T and the Women","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007105817","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVkNzMyZjItMzVhZi00MGU3LThmM2YtZjdkMjQxNmRkYzY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVkNzMyZjItMzVhZi00MGU3LThmM2YtZjdkMjQxNmRkYzY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000166/","name":"Helen Hunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000396/","name":"Farrah Fawcett"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000265/","name":"Robert Altman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033691/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710828/","name":"Anne Rapp"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So when I was at first annoyed and angered by the beginning of this movie, I passed it off to his soon-to-come deeper agenda, which in "Dr. T..." never arrives.\n\nI loathe this movie.  Let me count the ways:\n\n1. (Most importantly) We are led to empathize with a man who believes he loves too much, too hard, and hence, the consequences.  This, if played out, would be great, as he gets his come-uppance, realizes the self-delusion and that his life and ways with women is a lie.  But that's not what happens. We are supposed to feel sorry for and sympathize with him the entire way, even as he cheats, avoids true responsibility and, despite what the ending is supposed to say, never changes.  Rather than the boy-birth being a sign of evolution/change/enlightenment, it debunks all that came before, in fact saying that all these women were the problem all along.  Instead of being a witty examination of flawed Dallas women, it concludes with a tacked-on non-epiphany, which by its very existence makes everything before it misogynistic, and none of the characters likeable.\n\n2.  Watch how many times Altman works in gratuitous nudity, like an 11 yr. old peeping tom.  When he shows Janine Turner's derriere-crack, at the end of her scene, it's not Richard Gere following it with his eyes,  it's the CAMERA, as if to say, "hey, look at this" -- like a little elbow in our sides.\n\n3.  He does the same thing often at the end of scenes, swinging the camera with a wink to pick up a sign, a heavy-handed metaphor or scene-link that is beginning film school pretentious artifice at its worst.\n\n4.  The editing and cinematography again is of the film-school variety, and at often times is like a rough cut.\n\n5.  Helen Hunt, who for years has been trying to convince us she's newly "sexy," is so self-conscious that we never can buy into any kind of character.  I am sick of her flinging her hair.\n\n6.  The camera holds so long on the golf sequences, as if to say - "these actors really can play golf," which they really don't very well.  But it becomes a call-attention lingering as opposed to a mere setting for dialogue.\n\n7.  The overly intrusive soundtrack by Lyle Lovett may be close to the worst in history.  Not only does it blot out large sequences of dialogue, and call attention to itself mindlessly at every turn, it actually has lyrics which say exactly what's going on in the scene.\n\n8.  The writing and dialogue are extremely sophomoric; very few times do the people seem real in what they're saying, and often they resort to movie cliche-speak.\n\n9.  Gere has a few good real moments, but the direction hurts him as well.\n\n10.  Altman's trademark "everyone speaking at once," in this movie is contrived and annoying.\n\n11. (And maybe worst of all) this movie made me replay all the movies of Altman that I really like and see that many of tendencies above that I criticize are prevalent in ALL of his movies, now tempering my enjoyment of them.  I now see a old lecher with a misogynistic bent and an arrested development, calling attention to his weaknesses in a pretentious and juvenile way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19346,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"gynecologist,public nudity,vagina,cheerleader,lesbian kiss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dr. T and the Women","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007105817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVkNzMyZjItMzVhZi00MGU3LThmM2YtZjdkMjQxNmRkYzY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVkNzMyZjItMzVhZi00MGU3LThmM2YtZjdkMjQxNmRkYzY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000166/","name":"Helen Hunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000396/","name":"Farrah Fawcett"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000265/","name":"Robert Altman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033691/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710828/","name":"Anne Rapp"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done. \n\nOnce again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not.

Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from "excellent" to "pure crap" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch.

I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.\n\nI hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?\n\nThe review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people.

It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matinée price.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191694,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"monster,nuclear explosion,explosion,strong female character,strong female lead","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810380569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Resident Evil: Apocalypse","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347149/","name":"Sienna Guillory","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531095/","name":"Eric Mabius"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936838/","name":"Alexander Witt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

There's a rapid succession of gory deaths, but the decision to film everything in darkness means we can almost never see anything too clearly.\n\nIt's not a terrible movie (sorry, I just love these movies) but the characters are very lacking in depth, and are never given any time to develop prior to being gouged or dismembered. This is one of the cruelest entries in either series if you consider some of the victims here. They now had that R-rating and were going for it! It's all edited in a way to confuse the viewer, the action moves too quickly at times. It's also the shortest movie of either series. A little more fleshing out ( no pun intended) of the characters and some lighting adjustments would have helped.\n\nThe Predalien was a brilliant idea, but I'm not sure I ever got a good look at it. I think the first AVP was better simply because the aliens were more bad ass than here, where they are less intimidating and are too easily dispatched. I guess this is the weakest link in the series overall, but I still liked most of it. I'm not that hard to please though, I'm a real ho for these movies!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119717,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-01-02","keywords":"predator,the predator character,murder of a pregnant woman,extraterrestrial,weapons fire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi682754329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MzQ4Njc5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MzQ4Njc5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043855/","name":"Reiko Aylesworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018679/","name":"Steven Pasquale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1560274/","name":"Shareeka Epps"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833779/","name":"Colin Strause"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833780/","name":"Greg Strause"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132161/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004307/","name":"Shane Salerno"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639321/","name":"Dan O'Bannon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795953/","name":"Ronald Shusett"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's a rapid succession of gory deaths, but the decision to film everything in darkness means we can almost never see anything too clearly.\n\nIt's not a terrible movie (sorry, I just love these movies) but the characters are very lacking in depth, and are never given any time to develop prior to being gouged or dismembered. This is one of the cruelest entries in either series if you consider some of the victims here. They now had that R-rating and were going for it! It's all edited in a way to confuse the viewer, the action moves too quickly at times. It's also the shortest movie of either series. A little more fleshing out ( no pun intended) of the characters and some lighting adjustments would have helped.\n\nThe Predalien was a brilliant idea, but I'm not sure I ever got a good look at it. I think the first AVP was better simply because the aliens were more bad ass than here, where they are less intimidating and are too easily dispatched. I guess this is the weakest link in the series overall, but I still liked most of it. I'm not that hard to please though, I'm a real ho for these movies!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119717,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-01-02","keywords":"predator,the predator character,murder of a pregnant woman,extraterrestrial,weapons fire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi682754329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MzQ4Njc5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MzQ4Njc5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043855/","name":"Reiko Aylesworth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018679/","name":"Steven Pasquale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1560274/","name":"Shareeka Epps"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833779/","name":"Colin Strause","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833780/","name":"Greg Strause"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132161/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004307/","name":"Shane Salerno","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639321/","name":"Dan O'Bannon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795953/","name":"Ronald Shusett"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most people seem to have deemed it as "one of the best animated movies of the decade" back in 2014. I'm not messing around though when I say that I wholeheartedly think that The LEGO Movie IS the best animated movie of the decade! To this day, I view it as the most unexpectedly "awesome" movie I've ever witnessed in my entire life. So as prophesied, I was pleading for this sequel to live up to its predecessor-despite disliking the watery trailers/teaser trailers/teaser teaser trailers/whatever configuration of a trailer I left out-and not bail-out like Hollywood's most popular, trivial, hop-scotch prequel/sequel/spinoff cash grabs.\n\nFor the first half of this movie, I can't lie, I was getting a tad concerned that this movie was going to suffer from major sequelitis due to its awfully turbo, too-meta-for-it's-own-good formula-that might I add, has become quite established already since we've seen this recipe fabricated more productively in three other LEGO movies. This mundane scheme appeared to be leading this movie off into oblivion. But, once the film gets kicking, it GETS kicking. The nucleus of this film starts to reveal itself as an emulate of the original LEGO Movie, thanks to its deftly kiddie-like version of a Christopher Nolan screenplay.\n\nThe Second Part decides to traverse off into another domain of family morals that sharply resonates as another clever parallel between the real world and the LEGO world that had me, by fair means, moved. Additionally, there are boatloads of themes that are acutely wholesome-although, slightly trite-that kids can blissfully digest.

Most people seem to have deemed it as "one of the best animated movies of the decade" back in 2014. I'm not messing around though when I say that I wholeheartedly think that The LEGO Movie IS the best animated movie of the decade! To this day, I view it as the most unexpectedly "awesome" movie I've ever witnessed in my entire life. So as prophesied, I was pleading for this sequel to live up to its predecessor-despite disliking the watery trailers/teaser trailers/teaser teaser trailers/whatever configuration of a trailer I left out-and not bail-out like Hollywood's most popular, trivial, hop-scotch prequel/sequel/spinoff cash grabs.\n\nFor the first half of this movie, I can't lie, I was getting a tad concerned that this movie was going to suffer from major sequelitis due to its awfully turbo, too-meta-for-it's-own-good formula-that might I add, has become quite established already since we've seen this recipe fabricated more productively in three other LEGO movies. This mundane scheme appeared to be leading this movie off into oblivion. But, once the film gets kicking, it GETS kicking. The nucleus of this film starts to reveal itself as an emulate of the original LEGO Movie, thanks to its deftly kiddie-like version of a Christopher Nolan screenplay.\n\nThe Second Part decides to traverse off into another domain of family morals that sharply resonates as another clever parallel between the real world and the LEGO world that had me, by fair means, moved. Additionally, there are boatloads of themes that are acutely wholesome-although, slightly trite-that kids can blissfully digest. Also, there are some good, good twists in here which ultimately, sustains the LCU's (LEGO Cinematic Universe's) streak of surprises.\n\nYes, it's not quite as authoritative or proficient as the original but, gosh-darn it, I can't deny that I was meticulously spellbinded by this rib-tickling sequel. Everything is totally not not awesome this time around.

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch.

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1543085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

The dialogue is just soooo simplistic and often demeaning to both the audience and the actors.\n\nDirection: Above average - considering the film is 'mainly' CGI - and getting both the actors and crew to stay on point must have been a pita - they did an excellent job.\n\nFurther on the plus side - there's a few moments of 'action/suspense', one moment of actual 'comedy' and over an hour and half of decent CGI... but that's it.\n\nAs an adult, I ploughed through this movie and nearly sobbed with relief when it ended - hopefully, my sacrifice will be taken into consideration if you think about watching this rubbish... but, if you have kids (9-11) then they're going to really enjoy it !!\n\nNote: I changed both my rating as an adult from a: 3 to (as a grandparent) a: 6 simply based upon my grandkids reaction to the film.

Sinister mystery of Hogwarts.","reviewBody":""... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath." Book Review, December 18, 2000\n\nThe second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.\n\nThe magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.\n\nIn "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.\n\nCharacters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.\n\n"I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us." - "Certainly." Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.\n\nRon Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.\n\nHermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.\n\n"We are badly influenced by it." Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.\n\n"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":580877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"invisibility cloak,sequel,wizard,basilisk,killing a monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1705771289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.\n\nIn "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.\n\nCharacters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.\n\n"I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us." - "Certainly." Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.\n\nRon Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.\n\nHermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.\n\n"We are badly influenced by it." Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.\n\n"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":580877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"invisibility cloak,sequel,wizard,basilisk,killing a monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1705771289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

There are a couple of solid action scenes, and the motorbike chase really is terrific, but this movie is too dumb and too awkwardly-directed for it to work on any level.\n\n3/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186341,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Easily one of the better books of the entire series by JK Rowling (including books 5 and 6), the darker and scarier take on the story was welcomed by fans of the films and the books everywhere as Director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) attempts to attach his name to an ever-growing franchise. But, rest assured, this film has many flaws.\n\nFor one, the acting remains a substantial problem that is bound to plague the fans for the remainder of the franchise, including the next few films that are already signed up. The big budget and the excellent special effects can't alleviate the responsibility that the three young actors have to presenting decent performances. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), despite improving immensely since the previous installment, remains stiff and uncharismatic on screen whereas Emma Watson's melodramatic take on the character of Hermione had the entire audience frustrated. She seems to be throwing herself into her role with too much gusto and enthusiasm, resulting in a pretentious and unsatisfying performance that remains a plague on the rest of the film's merits. Dumbledore is pathetic in his role, completely misunderstanding the direction of his character and ultimately illustrating Newell's lack of grasp of what Harry Potter is really all about. The only actor that seems to stand out in a positive light is indeed Rupert Grint (Ron) who takes his performance easily. From his flawless comic timing to his understanding of the more serious scenes as well, here is an actor we will no doubt see after the Harry Potter film franchise has concluded. He stands out as the more talented of the three teenagers.\n\nNewell's direction is furthermore extremely flawed, surprising after the brilliant and entertaining "Donnie Brasco". Not only does he fail to understand the needs and wants of the actors in their respective performances, but he seems to also clutch no grasp of what made this book so amazing. Gone now is the magic of Chris Columbus in the first and second installments of the franchise, and supposedly Newell was to present a darker take on our heroes. He does so, but at what expense? Whereas the book by all means illustrated a darker take, it did so through a compromise with the more magical and "Christmassy" elements of the first few Harry Potter books as well as the scarier elements. Newell completely abandons the magic of the first few films and goes for an all out "noir", losing one of the best bits about a Harry Potter film: magic.\n\nThe script remains tarred, leaving out some of the best and most entertaining elements of the novel such as the opening Quidditch World Cup - an exhilarating read and surely an excellent addition to the film? Once again, the elements that made the book so magical are completely left out in the script and are failed to be remedied by Newell's poor direction. The script's inability to identify emotions and character is further exemplified through the completely underdeveloped problem of Ron's jealousy of Harry, as well as the seemingly over-developed problem of Ron and Hermione's increasingly changing relationship. Where the book merely hints at such a concept, the script-writer deems it at the forefront and shows a half-assed attempt at a romantic comedy within a few weak scenes. It doesn't help when Emma Watson takes it seriously, either.\n\nThat being said, the special effects are relatively good throughout the three tasks that our Tri-Wizard champions must face - ranging from the amazing sequence of Harry dodging left and right to avoid the Hungarian Horntail Dragon hot on his heels, to the murky depths of the school lake as Harry explores the underworld of the blue. The cinematography of the film is fairly decent also, but by no means a notch above the previous three films.

Easily one of the better books of the entire series by JK Rowling (including books 5 and 6), the darker and scarier take on the story was welcomed by fans of the films and the books everywhere as Director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) attempts to attach his name to an ever-growing franchise. But, rest assured, this film has many flaws.\n\nFor one, the acting remains a substantial problem that is bound to plague the fans for the remainder of the franchise, including the next few films that are already signed up. The big budget and the excellent special effects can't alleviate the responsibility that the three young actors have to presenting decent performances. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), despite improving immensely since the previous installment, remains stiff and uncharismatic on screen whereas Emma Watson's melodramatic take on the character of Hermione had the entire audience frustrated. She seems to be throwing herself into her role with too much gusto and enthusiasm, resulting in a pretentious and unsatisfying performance that remains a plague on the rest of the film's merits. Dumbledore is pathetic in his role, completely misunderstanding the direction of his character and ultimately illustrating Newell's lack of grasp of what Harry Potter is really all about. The only actor that seems to stand out in a positive light is indeed Rupert Grint (Ron) who takes his performance easily. From his flawless comic timing to his understanding of the more serious scenes as well, here is an actor we will no doubt see after the Harry Potter film franchise has concluded. He stands out as the more talented of the three teenagers.\n\nNewell's direction is furthermore extremely flawed, surprising after the brilliant and entertaining "Donnie Brasco". Not only does he fail to understand the needs and wants of the actors in their respective performances, but he seems to also clutch no grasp of what made this book so amazing. Gone now is the magic of Chris Columbus in the first and second installments of the franchise, and supposedly Newell was to present a darker take on our heroes. He does so, but at what expense? Whereas the book by all means illustrated a darker take, it did so through a compromise with the more magical and "Christmassy" elements of the first few Harry Potter books as well as the scarier elements. Newell completely abandons the magic of the first few films and goes for an all out "noir", losing one of the best bits about a Harry Potter film: magic.\n\nThe script remains tarred, leaving out some of the best and most entertaining elements of the novel such as the opening Quidditch World Cup - an exhilarating read and surely an excellent addition to the film? Once again, the elements that made the book so magical are completely left out in the script and are failed to be remedied by Newell's poor direction. The script's inability to identify emotions and character is further exemplified through the completely underdeveloped problem of Ron's jealousy of Harry, as well as the seemingly over-developed problem of Ron and Hermione's increasingly changing relationship. Where the book merely hints at such a concept, the script-writer deems it at the forefront and shows a half-assed attempt at a romantic comedy within a few weak scenes. It doesn't help when Emma Watson takes it seriously, either.\n\nThat being said, the special effects are relatively good throughout the three tasks that our Tri-Wizard champions must face - ranging from the amazing sequence of Harry dodging left and right to avoid the Hungarian Horntail Dragon hot on his heels, to the murky depths of the school lake as Harry explores the underworld of the blue. The cinematography of the film is fairly decent also, but by no means a notch above the previous three films. Other technical aspects such as the score and the editing are relatively impressive but again pose no substantial superiority over the previous three films.\n\nTo sum up the film ... Different; yes. Better; not necessarily. A darker take definitely, Newell forgets to show the real magic behind the Harry Potter franchise. Poor acting for major characters, a patchy and inconsistent script that seemingly misinterprets the brilliance of Rowling's fourth novel, and Newell's inability to direct both the action and the actors on screen result in a film that is mediocre at best and completely undeserving of the recent hype that has accompanied its theatrical release. \n\nAll we can hope for is that the next film brings back the magic.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":572929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2005-11-23","keywords":"tournament,wizard,magic,school of magic,heroism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2611740953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY3NzkxMjMtZjMwNy00OTYwLWJhNDktZDgwZDZmMzZmOWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY3NzkxMjMtZjMwNy00OTYwLWJhNDktZDgwZDZmMzZmOWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001565/","name":"Mike Newell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176128/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own.

To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever  I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending.

Think about this - Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years, and his earliest release date is 2039. Charles Manson has been getting regular parole hearings since the 1990s. Who is more dangerous? A better question is who is more dangerous to the plutocracy. \n\nThe whole story is basically done in flashback after Madoff is incarcerated and is being interviewed by a reporter. This film takes the approach of assuming that the wife and sons knew nothing until Bernie told them right before he was arrested. If there is anything the Bernie Madoff story would teach you, it is "Don't steal from the very rich". The movie emphasized all of the little people who lost everything to the Ponzi scheme, but there were enough people with enough money left over - as in hundreds of millions - that they could hire attorneys and even claw back money from people who withdrew all of their money before Bernie went bust, even though they knew nothing of the scheme. Compare that to what happened to the banksters who swindled the entire nation - which was absolutely nothing, or Enron, where the Bush administration had to practically be shamed into prosecuting the executives who swindled investors. To date about 70% of the money Bernie Madoff swindled has been recovered, with "small" investors - those that invested less than a million - being made completely whole.\n\nAnyways, back to "The Wizard", which doesn't mention any of this. DeNiro was terrific as a guy who decided to keep his swindling secret to himself - and one smarmy associate played by Hank Azaria. Michelle Pfeiffer as Ruth Madoff almost stole the show from DeNiro as a woman who can't deal with being ostracized and hated for something she had nothing to do with. She wonders aloud how she got to be almost 70 and never learned to do anything for herself. De Niro's Madoff is shown as being able to compartmentalize how he is stealing from investors, many of whom are family and friends, encouraging those at the end to put in huge amounts of money to keep the scheme afloat in the wake of the 2008 crash, which is ultimately what did him in, and somehow sees taking what is left of his ill gotten gains and distributing it to his family and "a few loyal employees" before he turns himself in as "noblesse oblige" not just more theft, which it was.\n\nHints to Madoff's personality are in the little scenes. He is very stoic about being the world's biggest and most brazen thief caught to date, but he does get animated about a dirty dish and the way lobster is served at a society dinner he is hosting. \n\nThere is one particularly odd scene for Turner Classic Movie fans. At one point, while Bernie is under house arrest, Bernie and his wife decide to commit suicide in "a nice way" using Ambien and a bunch of other pharmaceuticals they have around the house. It doesn't work - they wake up the next morning. But as they lay in bed expecting to die, who pops up on the TV screen they are watching but the recently deceased Robert Osborne and TCM with him introducing Judy Garland singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". What an odd touch. I didn't even think anybody at HBO even knew that TCM existed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.\n\nLike some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.\n\nEspecially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.\n\nAs enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.\n\nHowever, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.\n\nVaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.\n\nAction-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.\n\nRegarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.\n\nOne has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.\n\nIn conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":291095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"fighting,one against many,man cut in half,spy,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi734968089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When their headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, the Kingsman's journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the US.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While The Dark Knight was more complex, more intellectually impressive, and The Joker was a more intimidating villain, I thought this movie did better with cohesion, evenness of pacing, and overall felt like a return to the neatly packaged story of Batman Begins. In fact, with the number of parallels the story and visuals had to the first film were almost *too* on the nose, but I think it still worked (but did we really need that a whole flock of bats *and* the shot of Bruce Wayne's father coming to rescue him? Also, what was up with Qui-Gon Jinn's force ghost randomly appearing??). The cast was once again a solid positive for this movie. Hardy's Bane, while far less impressive and a little more cartoonish than Heath Ledger's The Joker, served his purpose. Oldman continued to do a great job and Gordon-Levitt was a nice addition to the cast. Morgan Freeman was sidelined once again, though, leaving this cast blindingly white except for a few background characters who die. However, this cast also had a significant improvement over the previous two instalments in the trilogy: While the death of Rachel Dawes may have left Gotham woman-less at the end of The Dark Knight, both Hathaway's Catwoman and Cotillard's Miranda Tate were strong characters who were prominent throughout the movie and important to the plot. Could they have been a little better in their execution? Yes, although they were handicapped from being introduced for the first time in this movie compared to the men, and I thought the two added much needed balance to the cast's diversity as well as its motivations.\n\nThere was more heart in this than the previous two films, and it leaned into its emotional beats particularly in the ending. I would have liked more emotion throughout the series, and in contrast to the rest of this series the epilogue felt a little bit cheesy. Still, though, maybe that's okay. This movie did its best to earn the heartstring-pulls at the end, and it was certainly an emotionally satisfying and uplifting end to the trilogy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1575452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"dc comics,batman character,bruce wayne character,terrorist plot,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nokia Promotions Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2376312089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MjAxODE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3ODgwOA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MjAxODE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3ODgwOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the special Nokia promotional trailer for The Dark Knight Rises."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634300/","name":"Jonathan Nolan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275286/","name":"David S.

Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, Batman, with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman, is forced from his exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1345836/","name":"The Dark Knight Rises","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4ODQzNDY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA0NTM4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, Batman, with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman, is forced from his exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1345836/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"thedongwu","dateCreated":"2021-01-21","inLanguage":"English","name":"A strong and even conclusion","reviewBody":"This is a strong and satisfying end to the Nolan Batman trilogy. While The Dark Knight was more complex, more intellectually impressive, and The Joker was a more intimidating villain, I thought this movie did better with cohesion, evenness of pacing, and overall felt like a return to the neatly packaged story of Batman Begins. In fact, with the number of parallels the story and visuals had to the first film were almost *too* on the nose, but I think it still worked (but did we really need that a whole flock of bats *and* the shot of Bruce Wayne's father coming to rescue him? Also, what was up with Qui-Gon Jinn's force ghost randomly appearing??). The cast was once again a solid positive for this movie. Hardy's Bane, while far less impressive and a little more cartoonish than Heath Ledger's The Joker, served his purpose. Oldman continued to do a great job and Gordon-Levitt was a nice addition to the cast. Morgan Freeman was sidelined once again, though, leaving this cast blindingly white except for a few background characters who die. However, this cast also had a significant improvement over the previous two instalments in the trilogy: While the death of Rachel Dawes may have left Gotham woman-less at the end of The Dark Knight, both Hathaway's Catwoman and Cotillard's Miranda Tate were strong characters who were prominent throughout the movie and important to the plot. Could they have been a little better in their execution? Yes, although they were handicapped from being introduced for the first time in this movie compared to the men, and I thought the two added much needed balance to the cast's diversity as well as its motivations.\n\nThere was more heart in this than the previous two films, and it leaned into its emotional beats particularly in the ending. I would have liked more emotion throughout the series, and in contrast to the rest of this series the epilogue felt a little bit cheesy. Still, though, maybe that's okay. This movie did its best to earn the heartstring-pulls at the end, and it was certainly an emotionally satisfying and uplifting end to the trilogy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1575452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"dc comics,batman character,bruce wayne character,terrorist plot,sequel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nokia Promotions Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2376312089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MjAxODE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3ODgwOA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MjAxODE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3ODgwOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the special Nokia promotional trailer for The Dark Knight Rises.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634300/","name":"Jonathan Nolan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275286/","name":"David S.

It is also a little bit like Fringe. However there is no time travel or alternative universes in this yet. But I can see how i like it based on these two TV shows; there is a lot going on and you want to keep watching to see what happens. Acting may be a little mechanical and not as much depth to some characters that I would like but it looks good and is an interesting weird idea. I hope they do more Seasons and hope it maintains its good level.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":516,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-03-05","keywords":"drug","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3065809/","name":"Rosabell Laurenti Sellers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0636440/","name":"Désirée Nosbusch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1571804/","name":"Falk Hentschel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0783904/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314952/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0683188/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0559668/","name":"Rainer Matsutani"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, "the stacks," where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis.

It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":395626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"based on novel,capitalism,player,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.
